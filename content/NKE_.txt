products 

our nike brand product offerings are aligned around our consumer construct focused on men’s women’s and kids’ we also design products specifically for the jordan brand and converse we believe this approach allows us to create products that better meet individual consumer needs while accelerating our largest growth opportunities 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products our men’s women’s and jordan brand footwear products currently lead in footwear sales and we expect them to continue to do so 

we also sell sports apparel which features the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and highquality construction our men’s and women’s apparel products currently lead in apparel sales and we expect them to continue to do so we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos 

we sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the nike brand name including bags socks sport balls eyewear timepieces digital devices bats gloves protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary nike ihm inc doing business as air manufacturing innovation 

2022 form 10k 1 

our jordan brand designs distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball performance and culture using the jumpman trademark sales and operating results for jordan brand products are reported within the respective nike brand geographic operating segments 

our whollyowned subsidiary brand converse headquartered in boston massachusetts designs distributes and licenses casual sneakers apparel and accessories under the converse chuck taylor all star one star star chevron and jack purcell trademarks operating results of the converse brand are reported on a standalone basis

we also offer interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms including fitness and activity apps sport fitness and wellness content and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience 

sales and marketing 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic strategic operating and logisticsrelated factors as evidenced by the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities as well as changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors

product research design and development 

we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while decreasing our environmental impact 

in addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists physicians and other experts who consult with us and review certain designs materials and concepts for product and manufacturing design and other process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air zoom nike free flywire drifit flyknit flyease zoomx air max nike react and nike adapt technologies among others typifies our dedication to designing innovative products 

manufacturing 

virtually all of our footwear and apparel products are manufactured outside the united states by independent manufacturers with whom we contract and refer to as “contract manufacturers” many of these contract manufacturers operate multiple finished goods contract factories we are also supplied primarily indirectly by a number of materials or “tier 2” suppliers who provide the principal materials used in footwear and apparel finished goods products as of may 31 2022 we had 139 strategic tier 2 suppliers 

2022 form 10k 3 

as of may 31 2022 we were supplied by 120 finished goods footwear contract factories located in 11 countries for fiscal 2022 contract factories in vietnam indonesia and china manufactured approximately 44 30 and 20 of total nike brand footwear respectively the largest single footwear contract factory accounted for approximately 8 of total fiscal 2022 nike brand footwear production for fiscal 2022 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 58 of nike brand footwear production 

as of may 31 2022 we were supplied by 279 finished goods apparel contract factories located in 33 countries for fiscal 2022 contract factories in vietnam china and cambodia manufactured approximately 26 20 and 16 of total nike brand apparel respectively the largest single apparel contract factory accounted for approximately 10 of total fiscal 2022 nike brand apparel production for fiscal 2022 two apparel contract manufacturers each accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 54 of nike brand apparel production 

nike’s contract manufacturers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those contract manufacturers in the countries where manufacturing takes place 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and natural fiber textiles as well as polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2022 air manufacturing innovation a whollyowned subsidiary with facilities near beaverton oregon in dong nai province vietnam and st charles missouri as well as contract manufacturers in china and vietnam were our suppliers of nike airsole cushioning components used in footwear 

the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics yarns and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware 

in fiscal 2022 covid19 had impacts throughout our supply chain including loss of production as well as production and transportation delays however covid19 has not materially impacted the number or concentration of finished goods factories contract manufacturers or tier 2 suppliers in countries where we source footwear and apparel products despite competition for certain materials during fiscal 2022 contract manufacturers were able to source sufficient quantities of raw materials for use in our footwear and apparel products refer to item 1a risk factors for additional discussion of the impact of covid19 and sourcing risks on our business 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political tensions instability conflicts nationalism and terrorism and resulting sanctions and other measures imposed in response to such issues we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment nike also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements changes in and responses to us trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries have negatively affected and could in the future negatively affect us corporations including nike with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business either of which may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or our results of operations in addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses 

2022 form 10k 4 

legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations we source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer markets outside of the united states we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners refer to item 1a risk factors for additional information on risks relating to our international operations

economic and industry risks 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

• our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our products increased inventories reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts and lower gross margins 

• in the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so 

• we conduct transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition 

• continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability in addition supply chain issues caused by factors including the covid19 pandemic and geopolitical conflicts have impacted and may continue to impact the availability pricing and timing for obtaining commodities and raw materials 

• if retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations late retailer payments extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

• if retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers if contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products 

our financial condition and results of operations have been and could in the future be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization the covid19 pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused and may in the future cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the united states these events have led to and could again lead to adverse impacts to our global supply chain factory cancellation costs store closures and a decline in retail traffic and discretionary spending by consumers and in turn materially impact our business sales financial condition and results of operations as well as cause a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across our jurisdictions we cannot predict whether and to what degree our sales operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures risks presented by the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to 

• deterioration in economic conditions in the united states and globally including the effect of prolonged periods of inflation on our consumers and vendors 

• disruption to our distribution centers contract manufacturers finished goods contract factories and other vendors through the effects of facility closures increased operating costs reductions in operating hours labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures such as additional cleaning and disinfection procedures which have had and could in the future again have a significant impact on our planned inventory production and distribution including higher inventory levels or inventory shortages in various markets 

• impacts to our distribution and logistics providers’ ability to operate including labor and container shortages and increases in their operating costs these supply chain effects have had and could in the future have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand including digital demand and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in extended inventory transit times and an increase in our costs of production and distribution including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses 

• decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures reduced operating hours social distancing restrictions andor changes in consumer behavior 

2022 form 10k 10

• cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries including in the united states and bans on large public gatherings which have reduced consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers 

• the risk that any safety protocols in nikeowned or affiliated facilities including our offices will not be effective or not be perceived as effective or that any virusrelated illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities whether accurate or not 

• incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols conducting temperature checks covid19 testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces 

• bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us or result in revised payment terms cancellation or reduction of their orders 

• operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks as a result of continued workforce remote work arrangements and restrictions on employee travel and 

• significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future 

we continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating financial and tax planning projections including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic however we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments in particular we believe the ultimate impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the further spread and duration of covid19 including emerging variant strains of covid19 the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness the impact of the easing of restrictions in various regions the availability widespread distribution and acceptance as well as the safety and efficacy of vaccines for covid19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic even in those regions where we have experienced business recovery should those regions fail to fully contain covid19 or suffer a covid19 relapse those markets may not recover as quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition additionally covid19 related disruptions are making it more challenging to compare our performance including our revenue growth and overall profitability across quarters and fiscal years the pandemic may also affect our business results of operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks 

in addition the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate or occur concurrently with other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors any of which could have a material effect on us  

our products services and experiences face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products services and experiences the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of contract manufacturers that produce our products in addition we and our contract manufacturers compete with other companies and industries for raw materials used in our products our nike direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores and with digital commerce platforms in addition we compete with respect to the digital services and experiences we are able to offer our consumers including fitness and activity apps sport fitness and wellness content and services and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition these in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment services and experiences constitute significant risk factors in our operations in addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop and the continued proliferation of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our 

2022 form 10k 11 

competitors our costs may increase demand for our products may decline possibly significantly or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products 

economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates central banks may deploy various strategies to combat inflation including increasing interest rates which may impact our borrowing costs additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates including as a result of us policy changes and the russia and ukraine conflict that impact the us dollar value relative to other international currencies our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products the ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding covid19 particularly for retailers could also have an effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition 

climate change and other sustainabilityrelated matters or legal regulatory or market responses thereto may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

there are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have caused and may continue to cause potentially at a growing rate increases in global temperatures changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent andor prolonged extreme weather and climate events climate change may also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw materials including those used in the production of our products and may result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences which could in turn affect our business operating results and financial condition for example there has been increased focus by governmental and nongovernmental organizations consumers customers employees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably made and other sustainability matters including responsible sourcing and deforestation the use of plastic energy and water the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and materials transparency any of which may require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency due diligence and reporting in addition federal state or local governmental authorities in various countries have proposed and are likely to continue to propose legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or mitigate the impacts of climate change on the environment various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of climate change which could increase the complexity of and potential cost related to complying with such regulations any of the foregoing may require us to make additional investments in facilities and equipment may impact the availability and cost of key raw materials used in the production of our products or the demand for our products and in turn may adversely impact our business operating results and financial condition 

2022 form 10k 12 

although we have announced sustainabilityrelated goals and targets there can be no assurance that our stakeholders will agree with our strategies and any perception whether or not valid that we have failed to achieve or to act responsibly with respect to such matters or to effectively respond to new or additional legal or regulatory requirements regarding climate change could result in adverse publicity and adversely affect our business and reputation execution of these strategies and achievement of our goals is subject to risks and uncertainties many of which are outside of our control these risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to our ability to execute our strategies and achieve our goals within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes the availability and cost of raw materials and renewable energy unforeseen production design operational and technological difficulties the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments including the ability to scale projects and technologies on a commercially competitive basis such as carbon sequestration andor other related processes compliance with and changes or additions to global and regional regulations taxes charges mandates or requirements relating to greenhouse gas emissions carbon costs or climaterelated goals adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions and the actions of competitors and competitive pressures as a result there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute our strategies and achieve our sustainabilityrelated goals which could damage our reputation and customer and other stakeholder relationships and have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

given the broad and global scope of our operations we are particularly vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change such as shifts in weather patterns extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers offices headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes wildfires and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues have in the past temporarily disrupted and could in the future disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in and in the future could result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition in particular if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers manufacturers employees customers distribution centers and vendors are located our continued success would depend in part on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties computer network telecommunication and other systems and operations in addition a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending any of which could in turn result in negative pointofsale trends for our merchandise further climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters which may affect our business operations either in a particular region or globally as well as the activities of our thirdparty vendors and other suppliers manufacturers and customers we believe the diversity of locations in which we operate our operational size disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty services “information technology systems” position us well but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel for example our world headquarters are located in an active seismic zone which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects further if we are unable to find alternative suppliers replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology systems or supply systems we could be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers these events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or markdowns all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

business and operational risks 

failure to maintain our reputation brand image and culture could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation quality and sustainability and our continuing investment in design including materials marketing and sustainability measures may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media and digital environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences and products we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives 

our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity purpose and brand culture negative claims or publicity involving us our culture and values our products services and experiences consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate for example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate 

2022 form 10k 13 

their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand further our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change certain of our activities in response to such considerations social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations if the reputation culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business changes in covid19 related cancellations or postponements and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing cancellation or postponement of significant sporting events such as the nba finals olympics or the world cup among others in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions outbreaks of disease social or political unrest availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear apparel equipment and other products and services are essential to the commercial success of our products and development of new products research and development play a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or 

2022 form 10k 14 

onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken or statements made by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor or nonperformance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

to meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our nike direct operations including our retail stores and digital platforms have required and will continue to require significant investment our nike direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms because of their unique design and technological elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our nike direct retail stores a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure temporary or otherwise or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond our control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation 

in addition we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our nike direct operations and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms in order to deliver highquality digital experiences our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control we may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards a growing portion of consumers access our nike direct digital platforms but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms the success of our nike direct operations could be adversely impacted our competitors may develop or have already developed digital experiences features content services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance 

we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our nike direct operations and managements attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base could be materially adversely affected 

many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms we are increasingly using social 

2022 form 10k 15 

media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable secure userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition as use of our digital platforms continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers needs if we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline 

risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts we cannot provide assurance however that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and prevent cyberattacks system failures or data or information loss the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition in addition the increased use of employeeowned devices for communications as well as workfromhome arrangements such as those implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic present additional operational risks to our information technology systems including but not limited to increased risks of cyberattacks further like other companies in the retail industry we have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

we are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion 

2022 form 10k 16 

of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities the market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital capacity and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity including as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

as of may 31 2022 we were supplied by 120 finished goods footwear contract factories located in 11 countries we rely upon contract manufacturers which we do not own or operate to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell for fiscal 2022 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 58 of nike brand footwear production our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies or be unable to perform including as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary footwear contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

certain of our footwear contract manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product such contract manufacturers may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce if in the future the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized contract manufacturers no longer exist we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain footwear products in a timely manner or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

2022 form 10k 17 

the success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values 

our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals or our workplace culture or values could harm our business our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work onsite for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies policies which could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain our employees in addition shifts in us immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the united states w e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success and we have invested substantial time and resources in building maintaining and evolving our culture any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success including our ability to retain and recruit employees 

our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to united states or foreign employment regulations 

we have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which could have a direct impact on our operating costs a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs there is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment health and safety wage and hour laws criminal activity personal injury and other claims in addition if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we could be vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action which could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to operating a global business 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political tensions unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products changes in the us governments import and export policies including trade restrictions sanctions and countersanctions increased tariffs or quotas embargoes safeguards or customs restrictions could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition disease outbreaks including the recent covid19 pandemic terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials or our costs for manufacturing and procuring materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act as well as the anticorruption laws of other countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees independent contractors contract manufacturers suppliers and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and natural fiber textiles and polyurethane films — are locally available to manufacturers the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics yarns and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are also available in countries where our manufacturing takes

place both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contract manufacturers and materials suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption or heightened competition for such materials our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected closures unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that manufacturers that we do not contract and that we refer to as unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing contract manufacturer or materials supplier there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any contract manufacturer unaffiliated manufacturer or any materials supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing capacity or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages in the supply of materials or in the manufacturing of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because contract manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation container shortages labor shortages including work stoppages or port strikes infrastructure and port congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact the availability of our products and in turn our financial performance in addition delays in the shipment or delivery of our products manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products have required us and may in the future require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins changes in us trade policies including modifications to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements have also had and could continue to have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities have in the past and could be interrupted by information technology problems disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels if we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations furthermore laws regulations and policies and the interpretation of such can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of

operations and negatively impact our reputation the global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies have and will continue to arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks moreover the regulation of certain transactions we engage in including those involving nonfungible tokens nfts and cryptocurrencies remains in an early stage and subject to significant uncertainty as a result we are required to exercise our judgment as to whether or how certain laws or regulations apply or may in the future apply and it is possible that legislators regulators and courts may disagree with our conclusions any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

changes to us or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business reputation financial condition and results of operations in particular political and economic instability geopolitical conflicts political unrest civil strife terrorist activity acts of war public corruption expropriation nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the united states or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations any negative sentiment toward the united states as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business 

in addition changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business us presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

changes or proposed changes in us or other countries trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade tariffs and other changes in us trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods further any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the united states or in other countries could affect the trade environment the company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the united states and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development manufacturing use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights these actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective for example confidential information related to business strategy innovations new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation loss of intellectual property rights a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions in addition new products we offer such as nfts may raise various novel intellectual property law considerations including adequacy and scope of assignment licensing transfer copyright and other rightofuse issues 

2022 form 10k 20 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement adaptive products and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time any breach of our or our service providers networks or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous and sometimes conflicting regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states europe and elsewhere for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 five states in the united states california virginia colorado utah and connecticut passed data privacy laws in 2020 and 2021 china enacted the data security law and personal information protection law which became effective on september 1 2021 and november 1 2021 respectively and additional jurisdictions have adopted or are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations these laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws and regulations including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under laws in the european union united states and china can be costly and time consuming and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and as such we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change 

proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the us corporate tax rate although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate income tax expense and cash flows 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under various tax holidays we also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters these holidays expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met the impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate for example in january 2019 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the netherlands has breached state aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the company if this matter is adversely resolved the netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to prior periods and the companys income taxes related to prior periods in the netherlands could increase 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

2022 form 10k 21 

failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we have license agreements that permit independent parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental human rights health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors if one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with or is accused of violating or failing to comply with such standards and laws this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition negative publicity regarding production methods alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations including new or additional quotas tariffs sanctions product safety regulations or other regulatory measures by governmental authorities 

risks related to our securities investments and liquidity 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses or capabilities product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our nike direct operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations see also “ our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties ” 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2022 swoosh llc beneficially owned approximately 77 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2022 all of these shares were converted into class b common stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 16 the shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh llc the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock swoosh llc was formed by philip h knight our chairman emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock mr knight does not have voting rights with respect to swoosh llc although travis knight his son and a nike director has a significant role in the management of the class a common stock owned by swoosh llc 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poors and moodys investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to credit or capital markets could be adversely affected we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

2022 form 10k 22 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting estimates prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives income taxes and other contingencies our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions within our articles of incorporation and oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business

fiscal 2022 nike brand revenue highlights 

the following tables present nike brand revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment distribution channel and major product line 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

on a currencyneutral basis nike inc revenues increased 6 for fiscal 2022 driven by higher revenues in emea north america and apla partially offset by lower revenues in greater china higher revenues in emea and north america each contributed approximately 3 percentage points to nike inc revenues and apla contributed approximately 2 percentage points while lower revenues in greater china reduced nike inc revenues by approximately 2 percentage points 

on a currencyneutral basis nike brand footwear revenues increased 4 for fiscal 2022 driven by growth in nike direct partially offset by a decline in our wholesale business unit sales of footwear decreased 3 while higher average selling price asp per pair contributed approximately 7 percentage points of footwear revenue growth higher asp per pair was primarily due to higher nike direct asp the favorable impact of growth in our nike direct business higher fullprice asp net of discounts on a wholesale equivalent basis and a higher mix of fullprice sales 

currencyneutral nike brand apparel revenues increased 6 for fiscal 2022 driven primarily by growth in mens unit sales of apparel remained flat and higher asp per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth higher asp per unit was primarily due to higher fullprice and nike direct asps 

on a reported basis nike direct revenues represented approximately 42 of our total nike brand revenues for fiscal 2022 compared to 39 for fiscal 2021 nike brand digital sales were 107 billion for fiscal 2022 compared to 91 billion for fiscal 2021 on a currencyneutral basis nike direct revenues increased 15 for fiscal 2022 driven by nike brand digital sales growth of 18 comparable store sales growth of 10 in part due to improved physical retail traffic and the addition of new stores comparable store sales which exclude nike brand digital sales comprises revenues from nikeowned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met 1 the store has been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of covid19 comparable store sales represents a performance measure that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established nikeowned inline and factory stores management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry as a result our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 

on a currencyneutral basis fiscal 2022 nike brand revenue growth of 6 was primarily driven by increases in mens and the jordan brand which grew 3 and 7 respectively

gross margin 

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

for fiscal 2022 our consolidated gross profit increased 8 to 21479 million compared to 19962 million for fiscal 2021 gross margin increased 120 basis points to 460 for fiscal 2022 compared to 448 for fiscal 2021 due to the following 



the increase in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was primarily due to higher margin in our nike direct business a higher mix of fullprice sales on a wholesale equivalent basis and favorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates including hedges this activity was partially offset by higher product costs on a wholesale equivalent basis largely due to elevated freight and logistics costs as well as an increase in other costs primarily due to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized in greater china in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 

total selling and administrative expense 



1 demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts complimentary product television digital and print advertising and media costs brand events and retail brand presentation 

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

demand creation expense increased 24 for fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher advertising and marketing spend against brand campaigns as we experienced marketplace closures in the prior year due to covid19 as well as continued investments in digital marketing to support heightened digital demand changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased demand creation expense by approximately 1 percentage point 

operating overhead expense increased 11 for fiscal 2022 primarily due to higher strategic technology investments and increases in wagerelated expenses and nike direct variable costs this activity was partially offset by higher restructuringrelated costs in the prior year related to our organizational realignment for more information see note 21 — restructuring within the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements changes in foreign currency exchange rates had an insignificant impact on operating overhead expense 

other income expense net 



other income expense net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business

other income expense net changed from 14 million of other expense net in fiscal 2021 to 181 million of other income net in the current year primarily due to a 219 million net favorable change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses including hedges as well as a net favorable impact related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within apla partially offset by the onetime charge related to the deconsolidation of our russian operations

income taxes 



fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

our effective tax rate was 91 for fiscal 2022 compared to 140 for fiscal 2021 primarily due to a shift in our earnings mix and recognition of a noncash onetime benefit related to the onshoring of certain nonus intangible property ownership rights in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022

the corporate loss before interest and taxes primarily consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses 

in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results in corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments 

fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 

corporates loss before interest and taxes decreased 42 million during fiscal 2022 primarily due to the following 

• a favorable change in net foreign currency gains and losses of 219 million related to the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments reported as a component of consolidated other income expense net 

• an unfavorable change of 190 million related to the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard foreign currency exchange rates assigned to the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse net of hedge gains and losses these results are reported as a component of consolidated gross margin and 

• a favorable change of 13 million largely due to higher restructuringrelated costs associated with our organizational realignment in the prior year and to a lesser extent a net favorable impact related to our strategic distributor partnership transition within apla in the current year partially offset by the onetime charge related to the deconsolidation of our russian operations and higher administrative and wagerelated expenses in fiscal 2022 

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

• product costs — nikes product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 

1 product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity 

a certain nike entities purchase product from the ntc a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys nike branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in us dollars the ntc whose functional currency is the us dollar then sells the products to nike entities in their respective functional currencies ntc sales to a nike entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the ntc 

b other nike entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in us dollars these purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those nike entities with a functional currency other than the us dollar 

in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

2 factory input costs nike operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies “factory currency exposure index” in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of nike branded products “factory input costs” are denominated 

for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces nikes us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

• nonfunctional currency denominated external sales — a portion of our nike brand and converse revenues associated with european operations are earned in currencies other than the euro eg the british pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency these sales generate a foreign currency exposure 

• other costs — nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent in certain cases the company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through other income expense net refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

• nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities — our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies these balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations 

managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 

2022 form 10k 43 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a detriment of approximately 295 million a benefit of approximately 893 million and a detriment of approximately 867 million for the years ended may 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 87 million a benefit of approximately 260 million and a detriment of approximately 212 million for the years ended may 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 management has concluded our argentina subsidiary within our apla operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market as a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the us dollar as of and for the period ended may 31 2022 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated investments at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under us gaap we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of the purchase of us dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net had favorable impacts of approximately 132 million and 19 million and an unfavorable impact of approximately 91 million on our income before income taxes for the years ended may 31 2022 2021 and 2020 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with us gaap there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2022 and 2021 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2022 2021 and 2020

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

cash provided used by operations was an inflow of 5188 million for fiscal 2022 compared to 6657 million for fiscal 2021 net income adjusted for noncash items generated 6848 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2022 compared to 6612 million for fiscal 2021 the net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to cash provided used by operations of 1660 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 45 million for fiscal 2021 the net change in working capital was unfavorably impacted by a 2183 million increase in inventories partially offset by a favorable impact from a 1102 million decrease in accounts receivable these changes were in part due to supply chain constraints which caused higher levels of intransit inventory and therefore a lower supply of available inventory to meet consumer demand 

cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 1524 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of 3800 million for fiscal 2021 primarily driven by the net change in shortterm investments during fiscal 2022 the net change in shortterm investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash outflow of 747 million compared to a cash outflow of 3276 million in fiscal 2021 additionally during fiscal 2022 we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain in future periods we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3 of annual revenues 

cash provided used by financing activities was an outflow of 4836 million for fiscal 2022 compared to an outflow of 1459 million for fiscal 2021 this change was driven by our resumption of the share repurchase program in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 resulting in 4014 million of share repurchases during fiscal 2022 compared to 608 million during fiscal 2021 

in fiscal 2022 we purchased 273 million shares of nikes class b common stock for 3994 million an average price of 14611 per share under the fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in june 2018 as of may 31 2022 we had repurchased 774 million shares at a cost of 8663 million an average price of 11198 per share under this program in june 2022 the board of directors authorized a new fouryear 18 billion program to repurchase shares of the companys class b common stock the new program will replace the current 15 billion share repurchase program which will be terminated in fiscal 2023 repurchases under the new program will be made in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with the securities and exchange commission rule 10b18 subject to market conditions applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors the new share repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and it may be suspended at any time at our discretion we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash the timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on july 23 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement the “shelf” with the us securities and exchange commission sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time the shelf expires on july 23 2022 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2022

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively as it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on march 11 2022 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fees and interest rates would increase conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fees and interest rates would decrease changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and

• product purchase obligations — as of may 31 2022 we had product purchase obligations of 66 billion all of which are payable within the next 12 months product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms we generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations in some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process

refer to note 18 — commitments and contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to our offbalance sheet arrangements bank guarantees and letters of credit 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

new accounting pronouncements 

we do not expect that any recently issued accounting pronouncements will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

critical accounting estimates 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting estimates described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit  finance committee of the board of directors 

these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of a given date because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting estimates within the context of these critical accounting estimates we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

revenue is recognized when transfer of control to the customer has occurred which is either upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the terms of sale the transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers 

the provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date 

estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded if actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 

refer also to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 16 — revenues in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

inventory reserves 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 

2022 form 10k 47 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant amount of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in cost of sales as the related sales occur for contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within demand creation expense 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs in rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence 

income taxes 

we are subject to taxation in the united states as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws on an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

2022 form 10k 48 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

we historically had not provided for deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as they were considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 in connection with a change in our legal entity structure that reduced the withholding tax consequences of a decision to remit undistributed earnings in the netherlands we changed our assertion regarding our ability and intent to indefinitely reinvest undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries we have evaluated our historic indefinite reinvestment assertion as a result of the legal entity restructuring and determined that any historical or future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are no longer considered to be indefinitely reinvested there is no deferred tax liability associated with those earnings 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

refer to note 9 — income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2022 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro chinese yuanus dollar and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 99 million and 92 million as of may 31 2022 and 2021 respectively the var increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of may 31 2022 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 170 million and 184 million during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021 respectively 

2022 form 10k 50 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows

products 

we focus our nike brand product offerings in six key categories running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer training and sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as american football baseball cricket golf lacrosse skateboarding tennis volleyball walking wrestling and other outdoor activities in june 2020 we announced that we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on men’s women’s and kids this approach is intended to allow us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs including more specialization of our category approach while realigning and simplifying our business to accelerate our largest growth opportunities 

nikes athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products sportswear the jordan brand and running are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales 

we also sell sports apparel covering the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use although many of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes and demonstrates our commitment to innovation and highquality construction sportswear training football soccer and running are currently our topselling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos 

we sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the nike brand name including bags socks sport balls eyewear timepieces digital devices bats gloves protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary nike ihm inc doing business as air manufacturing innovation

sales and marketing 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic strategic operating and logisticsrelated factors as evidenced by the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities as well as changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political tensions instability conflicts nationalism and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment nike also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements changes in and responses to us trade policies including the imposition of tariffs or penalties on imported goods or retaliatory measures by other countries could negatively affect us corporations including nike with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries which could also make it necessary for us to change the way we conduct business either of which may have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or our results of operations in addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions we work with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers domestic economies and the important role they may play in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations we source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer 

2021 form 10k 4

economic and industry risks 

our financial condition and results of operations have been and could in the future be adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic 

a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a 

2021 form 10k 10 

pandemic by the world health organization to date this pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused and may in the future cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the united states these events have led to and could again lead to a decline in discretionary spending by consumers and in turn materially impact our business sales financial condition and results of operations we cannot predict whether and to what degree our sales operations and financial results could in the future be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures risks presented by the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to 

• deterioration in economic conditions in the united states and globally 

• reduced consumer demand for our products if consumers seek to reduce or delay discretionary spending in response to the impacts of covid19 including as a result of a rise in unemployment rates and diminished consumer confidence 

• cancellation or postponement of sports seasons and sporting events in multiple countries including in the united states and bans on large public gatherings which have reduced consumer spending on our products and could impact the effectiveness of our arrangements with key endorsers 

• decreased retail traffic as a result of store closures reduced operating hours social distancing restrictions andor changes in consumer behavior 

• the risk that any safety protocols in nikeowned or affiliated facilities including our offices will not be effective or not be perceived as effective or that any virusrelated illnesses will be linked or alleged to be linked to such facilities whether accurate or not 

• incremental costs resulting from the adoption of preventative measures and compliance with regulatory requirements including providing facial coverings and hand sanitizer rearranging operations to follow social distancing protocols conducting temperature checks covid19 testing and undertaking regular and thorough disinfecting of surfaces 

• disruption to our distribution centers and our thirdparty manufacturing partners and other vendors including through the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures including for additional cleaning and disinfection procedures 

• bankruptcies or other financial difficulties facing our wholesale customers which could cause them to be unable to make or delay making payments to us or result in cancellation or reduction of their orders 

• operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks as a result of continued workforce remote work arrangements and restrictions on employee travel 

• impacts to our distribution and logistics providers ability to operate or increases in their operating costs these supply chain effects have had an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand including digital demand and have in the past resulted in and could in the future result in an increase in our costs of production and distribution including increased freight and logistics costs and other expenses and 

• significant disruption of and volatility in global financial markets which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital in the future 

we continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating financial and tax planning projections including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic however we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments in particular we believe the ultimate impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the further spread and duration of covid19 the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness the availability widespread distribution and acceptance as well as the safety and efficacy of vaccines for covid19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic even in those regions where we have experienced business recovery should those regions fail to fully contain covid19 or suffer a covid19 relapse those markets may not recover as quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the pandemic may also affect our business operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks 

in addition the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors any of which could have a material effect on us  

2021 form 10k 11 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

• our sales are impacted by discretionary spending by consumers declines in consumer spending have in the past and in the future may result in reduced demand for our products increased inventories reduced orders from retailers for our products order cancellations lower revenues higher discounts and lower gross margins 

• in the future we may be unable to access financing in the credit and capital markets at reasonable rates in the event we find it desirable to do so 

• we conduct transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar continued volatility in the markets and exchange rates for foreign currencies and contracts in foreign currencies could have a significant impact on our reported operating results and financial condition 

• continued volatility in the availability and prices for commodities and raw materials we use in our products and in our supply chain such as cotton or petroleum derivatives could have a material adverse effect on our costs gross margins and profitability 

• if retailers of our products experience declining revenues or experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase our products this could result in reduced orders for our products order cancellations late retailer payments extended payment terms higher accounts receivable reduced cash flows greater expense associated with collection efforts and increased bad debt expense 

• if retailers of our products experience severe financial difficulty some may become insolvent and cease business operations which could negatively impact the sale of our products to consumers if contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products 

our products services and experiences face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products services and experiences the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products our nike direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores and with digital commerce platforms in addition we compete with respect to the digital services and experiences we are able to offer our consumers including fitness and activity apps sport fitness and wellness content and services and digital services and features in retail stores that enhance the consumer experience 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition these in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment services and experiences constitute significant risk factors in our operations in addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop and the continued proliferation of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase demand for our products may decline possibly significantly or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products 

economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdoms exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” or new or proposed us policy changes that impact the us dollar value relative to other international currencies our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses 

2021 form 10k 12 

could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products the ongoing financial uncertainty surrounding covid19 particularly for retailers could also have an effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers offices headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes wildfires and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues have in the past temporarily disrupted and could in the future disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past resulted in and in the future could result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition in particular if a natural disaster or severe weather event were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers and vendors are located our continued success would depend in part on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties computer network telecommunication and other systems and operations in addition a natural disaster or severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending any of which could in turn result in negative pointofsale trends for our merchandise further climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters which may affect our business operations either in a particular region or globally as well as the activities of our thirdparty vendors and other suppliers manufacturers and customers in addition the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences which could in turn affect our business operating results and financial condition we believe the diversity of locations in which we operate our operational size disaster recovery and business continuity planning and our information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty services “information technology systems” position us well but may not be sufficient for all or for concurrent eventualities if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event or concurrent events we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel for example our world headquarters are located in an active seismic zone which is at a higher risk for earthquakes and the related consequences or effects further if we are unable to find alternative suppliers replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology systems or supply systems we could be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers these events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or markdowns all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition

business and operational risks 

failure to maintain our reputation brand image and culture could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives 

our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity purpose and brand culture negative claims or publicity involving us our culture and values our products services and experiences consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate for example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand further our reputation and brand image could be damaged as a result of our support of association with or lack of support or disapproval of certain social causes as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change certain of our activities in response to such considerations social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations if the reputation culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time or in the future as a result of strategic shifts in our business changes in covid19 related cancellations or postponements and seasonal or geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing cancellation or postponement of significant sporting events such as the nba finals olympics or the world cup among others in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions outbreaks of disease social or political unrest availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

2021 form 10k 14 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing processes of footwear apparel and equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development play a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance and reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken or statements made by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products or brand that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products and brand or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

to meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages could delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our nike direct operations including our retail stores and digital platforms have required and will continue to require significant investment our nike direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms because of their unique design and technological elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our nike direct retail stores a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure temporary or otherwise or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond our control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation 

in addition we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our nike direct operations and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms in order to deliver highquality digital experiences our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control we may not be successful 

2021 form 10k 15 

in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards a growing portion of consumers access our nike direct digital platforms but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms the success of our nike direct operations could be adversely impacted our competitors may develop or have already developed digital experiences features content services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance 

we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our nike direct operations and managements attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base could be materially adversely affected 

many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital services and experiences that are offered on mobile platforms we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable secure userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition as use of our digital platforms continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers needs if we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline 

risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts we cannot provide assurance however that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and prevent cyberattacks system failures or data or information loss the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition in addition the increased use of employeeowned devices for communications as well as workfromhome arrangements such as those implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic present additional operational risks to our information technology systems including but not limited to increased risks of cyberattacks further like other companies in the retail industry we have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and 

2021 form 10k 16 

profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

we are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities the market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital capacity and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity including as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by 191 footwear factories located in 14 countries we do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2021 four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2021 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2021 our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies or be unable to perform including as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

certain of our manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product such manufacturing partners may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce if in the future the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized manufacturers no longer exist we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

the success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values 

our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals or our workplace culture or values could harm our business our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel changes to our current and future office environments or adoption of a new work model that expects employees to work onsite for a specified number of days with some flexibility to work remotely on other days may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to other companies policies which could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain our employees in addition shifts in us immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the united states w e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success and we have invested substantial time and resources in building maintaining and evolving our culture any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success including our ability to retain and recruit employees 

our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to united states or foreign employment regulations 

we have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which could have a direct impact on our operating costs a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforce could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs there is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment health and safety wage and hour laws criminal activity personal injury and other claims in addition if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we could be vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action which could have an adverse effect on our business 

risks related to operating a global business 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political tensions unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products this includes for example the effect of brexit including implementation of the legal and regulatory framework that applies to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union and other countries as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the united states and elsewhere as further described below under “we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate” and “changes to us or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations” changes in the us presidential administrations import and export policies including trade restrictions increased tariffs or quotas embargoes safeguards or customs restrictions could require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition disease outbreaks including the recent covid19 pandemic terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure 

2021 form 10k 18 

materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act as well as the anticorruption laws of other countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors suppliers and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our independent contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates and other labor standards that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our independent contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages or other changes in labor standards whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals fabrics or raw materials used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins changes in us trade policies including to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our reputation or results of operations 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities have in the past and could be interrupted by information technology problems disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

2021 form 10k 19 

legal regulatory and compliance risks 

we are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels if we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations furthermore laws regulations and policies and the interpretation of such can conflict among jurisdictions and compliance in one jurisdiction may result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation the global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

changes to us or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business reputation financial condition and results of operations in particular political and economic instability geopolitical conflicts political unrest civil strife terrorist activity acts of war public corruption expropriation nationalism and other economic or political uncertainties in the united states or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations any negative sentiment toward the united states as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business 

in addition changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business us presidential administrations have instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

changes or proposed changes in us or other countries trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade tariffs and other changes in us trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods further any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the united states or in other countries could affect the trade environment the company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the united states and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development manufacturing use importation andor sale of certain products 

2021 form 10k 20 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights these actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective for example confidential information related to business strategy innovations new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation loss of intellectual property rights a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement adaptive products and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time any breach of our or our service providers networks or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous and sometimes conflicting regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states europe and elsewhere for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 and california passed the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 and additional jurisdictions are considering proposing or adopting similar regulations these laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under gdpr and ccpa and regulations can be costly and time consuming and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and as such we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change 

proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings and could increase the us corporate tax rate although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate income tax expense and cash flows 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are under various tax holidays we also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters these holidays expire from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met the impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate for example in january 2019 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the netherlands has breached state aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the company if this matter is adversely resolved the netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the companys netherlands income taxes in the future could increase 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the 

2021 form 10k 21 

applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit independent parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental human rights health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require our contract manufacturers and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors if one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with or is accused of violating or failing to comply with such standards and laws this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition negative publicity regarding production methods alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations including new or additional quotas tariffs sanctions product safety regulations or other regulatory measures by governmental authorities 

risks related to our securities investments and liquidity 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses or capabilities product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our nike direct operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations see also “ our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties ” 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience 

2021 form 10k 22 

difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives income taxes and other contingencies our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions within our articles of incorporation and oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business

gross margin 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

for fiscal 2021 our consolidated gross profit increased 23 to 19962 million compared to 16241 million for fiscal 2020 as the prior fiscal year was significantly impacted by lower shipments to our wholesale customers and store closures within our nike direct operations due to covid19 gross margin increased 140 basis points to 448 for fiscal 2021 compared to 434 for fiscal 2020 due to the following 



favorable nike brand fullprice product margins across both our wholesale and nike direct businesses primarily reflect higher fullprice asp net of discounts additionally the favorable impact of growth in our higher margin nike direct business led by nike owned digital was more than offset by higher promotions in our factory stores during the first half of fiscal 2021 to reduce excess inventory as a result of covid19 lower other costs are due to annualizing certain impacts of covid19 from fiscal 2020 including lower factory cancellation charges lower inventory obsolescence reserves as well as the favorable rate impact of fixed supply chain costs on a higher volume of wholesale shipments 

total selling and administrative expense 



1 demand creation expense consists of advertising and promotion costs including costs of endorsement contracts complimentary product television digital and print advertising and media costs brand events and retail brand presentation 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

demand creation expense decreased 13 for fiscal 2021 due to lower marketing and advertising expenses for our brand events and retail operations as well as lower sports marketing expense as sporting events were postponed due to covid19 this activity was partially offset by higher digital marketing investments changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2021 

operating overhead expense increased 4 for fiscal 2021 due to an increase in strategic technology investments higher nike direct variable costs and approximately 255 million in restructuringrelated costs partially offset by lower bad debt expense and lower travel and related expenses changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2021 

other income expense net

2021 form 10k 34 

fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

other income expense net decreased from 139 million of other expense net in fiscal 2020 to 14 million of other expense net in the current year primarily due to the nonrecurring impairment charge of 405 million incurred in the prior year associated with our planned strategic distributor partnership transition within apla partially offset by a 241 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses including hedges 

for more information related to our distributor partnership transition within apla see note 20 — acquisitions and divestitures within the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net had a favorable impact on our income before income taxes of 19 million for fiscal 2021 

income taxes 



fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 

our effective tax rate was 140 for fiscal 2021 compared to 121 for fiscal 2020 due to a change in the proportion of earnings taxed in the us related to the recovery from the impact of the covid19 pandemic and less favorable impacts from discrete items such as stockbased compensation

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

• product costs — nikes product costs are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies in the following ways 

1 product purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the transacting entity 

a certain nike entities purchase product from the ntc a whollyowned sourcing hub that buys nike branded products from thirdparty factories predominantly in us dollars the ntc whose functional currency is the us dollar then sells the products to nike entities in their respective functional currencies ntc sales to a nike entity with a different functional currency results in a foreign currency exposure for the ntc 

b other nike entities purchase product directly from thirdparty factories in us dollars these purchases generate a foreign currency exposure for those nike entities with a functional currency other than the us dollar 

in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

2 factory input costs nike operates a foreign currency adjustment program with certain factories the program is designed to more effectively manage foreign currency risk by assuming certain of the factories foreign currency exposures some of which are natural offsets to our existing foreign currency exposures under this program our payments to these factories are adjusted for rate fluctuations in the basket of currencies “factory currency exposure index” in which the labor materials and overhead costs incurred by the factories in the production of nike branded products “factory input costs” are denominated 

for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces nikes us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

• nonfunctional currency denominated external sales — a portion of our nike brand and converse revenues associated with european operations are earned in currencies other than the euro eg the british pound but are recognized at a subsidiary that uses the euro as its functional currency these sales generate a foreign currency exposure 

• other costs — nonfunctional currency denominated costs such as endorsement contracts also generate foreign currency risk though to a lesser extent in certain cases the company has entered into contractual agreements which have payments indexed to foreign currencies that create embedded derivative contracts recorded at fair value through other income expense net refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

• nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities — our global subsidiaries have various assets and liabilities primarily receivables and payables including intercompany receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies these balance sheet items are subject to remeasurement which may create fluctuations in other income expense net within our consolidated results of operations 

managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 

2021 form 10k 43 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit of approximately 893 million a detriment of approximately 867 million and a detriment of approximately 1236 million for the years ended may 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit of approximately 260 million a detriment of approximately 212 million and a detriment of approximately 233 million for the years ended may 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 management has concluded our argentina subsidiary within our apla operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market as a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the us dollar as of and for the period ended may 31 2021 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated investments at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under us gaap we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of the purchase of us dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net had a favorable impact of approximately 19 million and unfavorable impacts of 91 million and 97 million on our income before income taxes for the years ended may 31 2021 2020 and 2019 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with us gaap there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2021 and 2020 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2021 2020 and 2019

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

cash provided used by operations was an inflow of 6657 million for fiscal 2021 compared to 2485 million for fiscal 2020 net income adjusted for noncash items generated 6612 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2021 compared to 3730 million for fiscal 2020 the increase primarily reflects the recovery of our business operations from the impact of covid19 the net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to cash provided used by operations of 45 million for fiscal 2021 compared to a decrease of 1245 million for fiscal 2020 the net change in working capital was impacted by a 2361 million decrease in inventories driven by strong consumer demand as we return to healthy inventory levels across markets closed in the prior year due to covid19 an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities also contributed to the net change in working capital primarily due to reduced spending in fiscal 2020 as a result of covid19 in addition the net change in working capital was impacted by a 2845 million increase in accounts receivable net primarily driven by higher revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 

cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 3800 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an outflow of 1028 million for fiscal 2020 primarily driven by higher purchases of shortterm investments during fiscal 2021 the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash outflow of 3276 million compared to a cash inflow of 27 million in fiscal 2020 additionally during fiscal 2021 we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain in future periods we expect to make annual capital expenditures of approximately 3 of annual revenues 

cash provided used by financing activities was an outflow of 1459 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an inflow of 2491 million for fiscal 2020 this change was primarily due to the net proceeds from a 5942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 partially offset by lower share repurchases during fiscal 2021 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 to enhance our liquidity position in response to covid19 we elected to temporarily suspend share repurchases under our existing share repurchase program the existing program remained authorized by the board of directors and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 we began repurchasing shares under the program in fiscal 2021 we purchased 49 million shares of nikes class b common stock for 650 million an average price of 13354 per share under the fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in june 2018 as of may 31 2021 we had repurchased 500 million shares at a cost of 4669 million an average price of 9333 per share under this program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows and excess cash the timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on july 23 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement the “shelf” with the us securities and exchange commission sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time the shelf expires on july 23 2022 

on august 16 2019 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 3 billion in total upon lender approval the facility matures on august 16 2024 with a oneyear extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond august 16 2026 this facility replaces the prior 2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on august 28 2015 which would have matured august 28 2020 on march 15 2021 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 15 billion in total upon lender approval the facility matures on march 14 2022 with a 364day extension option up to 30 days prior to the existing termination date provided that in no event shall the facility extend beyond march 13 2023 this facility replaces the prior 2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on april 6 2020 which would have matured on april 5 2021 as of may 31 2021 and 2020 no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for additional information 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively as it relates to our committed credit facilities entered into on august 16 2019 and march 15 2021 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fees and interest rates would increase conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fees and interest rates would decrease changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become 

2021 form 10k 45 

immediately due and payable as of may 31 2021 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity was also provided by our 3 billion commercial paper program which we decreased from 4 billion in connection with the new credit facility agreement entered into on march 15 2021 as described above during the fiscal year ended may 31 2021 the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was 248 million no commercial paper was outstanding as of may 31 2021 as of may 31 2020 we had 248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 165 

we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 

as of may 31 2021 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 135 billion primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds us government sponsored enterprise obligations us treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2021 the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 54 days 

we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt given our existing structure if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2021 and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



1 the cash payments due for longterm debt include estimated interest payments estimates of interest payments are based on outstanding principal amounts applicable fixed interest rates or currently effective interest rates as of may 31 2021 if variable timing of scheduled payments and the term of the debt obligations 

2 the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete public figure sport team and league endorsers of our products actual payments under some contracts may be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements andor royalties on product sales in future periods actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as these contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athletic performance declines in future periods 

2021 form 10k 46 

in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

3 we generally order product at least four to five months in advance of sale based primarily on advanced orders received from external wholesale customers and internal orders from our direct to consumer operations the amounts listed for product purchase obligations represent agreements including open purchase orders to purchase products in the ordinary course of business that are enforceable and legally binding and specify all significant terms in some cases prices are subject to change throughout the production process 

4 other purchase obligations primarily include construction service and marketing commitments including marketing commitments associated with endorsement contracts made in the ordinary course of business the amounts represent the minimum payments required by legally binding contracts and agreements that specify all significant terms and may include open purchase orders for nonproduct purchases 

5 represents the future cash payments due as part of the transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which is reflected net of foreign tax credits we utilized refer to part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data note 9  income taxes in our fiscal 2020 form 10k which was filed with the united states securities and exchange commission on july 24 2020 for additional information 

in addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur refer to note 9 — income taxes and note 13 — benefit plans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2021 refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2021 we had bank guarantees and letters of credit outstanding totaling 275 million issued primarily for real estate agreements selfinsurance programs and other general business obligations 

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit  finance committee of the board of directors 

these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of a given date because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

beginning in fiscal 2019 we adopted accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606 our revenue recognition policies under topic 606 are described in the following paragraphs 

revenue transactions associated with the sale of nike brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels we satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred based on the terms of sale a customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive 

2021 form 10k 47 

substantially all of the benefits of the product control is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment the transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions 

as part of our revenue recognition policy consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers we estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against revenues with an offsetting increase to accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized the estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets 

the provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date 

estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded if actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 

refer also to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 16 — revenues for additional information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory reserves 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant amount of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in cost of sales as the related sales occur for contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within demand creation expense 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset 

2021 form 10k 48 

group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs in rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence 

income taxes 

we are subject to taxation in the united states as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws on an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

we have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings are generated the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us operations may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional withholding tax expense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

refer to note 9 — income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

2021 form 10k 49 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

2021 form 10k 50 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2021 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro chinese yuanus dollar and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 92 million and 48 million as of may 31 2021 and 2020 respectively the var increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities as of may 31 2021 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 184 million and 126 million during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 respectively 

2021 form 10k 51 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies and fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows

our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products directly to consumers through nikeowned retail stores and digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our “nike direct” operations and to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world we also offer interactive consumer experiences through our digital platforms virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad 

products 

we focus our nike brand product offerings in six key categories running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer training and sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as american football baseball cricket golf lacrosse skateboarding tennis volleyball walking wrestling and other outdoor activities 

nikes athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products sportswear the jordan brand and running are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales 

we also sell sports apparel covering the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use and also demonstrates our commitment to innovation and highquality construction sportswear training and running are currently our topselling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos

sales and marketing 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors as evidenced by the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity and availability of various sports and fitness activities as well as changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors

significant customer 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our consolidated net revenues during fiscal 2020  

product research design and development 

we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste 

in addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists physicians and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products and experiences incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories and consumer applications using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories to respond to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air zoom free flywire drifit flyknit flyweave flyease zoomx react and adaptive technologies among others throughout our running nike basketball jordan brand football soccer training and sportswear categories as well as converse typifies our dedication to designing innovative products 

manufacturing 

we are supplied by 122 footwear factories located in 12 countries virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by over 15 independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9 of total fiscal 2020 nike brand footwear production for fiscal 2020  contract factories in vietnam indonesia and china manufactured approximately 50  24 and 22 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in argentina and india to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries for fiscal 2020  four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of nike brand footwear production

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2020  air manufacturing innovation a whollyowned subsidiary with facilities near beaverton oregon in dong nai province vietnam and st charles missouri as well as independent contractors in china and

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2020  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina brazil canada india south africa and uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 4 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment nike also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements changes in us trade policies including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods may negatively affect us corporations with production activities outside the us including nike there have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods which could negatively affect us corporations with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the us government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations we source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer markets outside of the united states and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners 

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas anta asics li ning lululemon athletica puma under armour and vf corporation among others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations

risk factors 

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nikes business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nikes business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nikes policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus pandemic 

a n ovel strain of coronavirus covid19 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization to date this pandemic and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the pandemic have caused and are expected to continue to cause business slowdown or shutdown in affected areas and significant disruption in the 

2020 form 10k 8 

financial markets both globally and in the united states these events have led to and could continue to lead to a decline in discretionary spending by consumers and in turn materially impact our business sales financial condition and results of operations we have experienced a negative i mpact on our sales operations and financial results and we cannot predict the degree to or the time period over which our sales operations and financial results will continue to be affected by the pandemic and preventative measures risks presented by the covid19 pandemic include but are not limited to 

 we continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating financial and tax planning projections including assumptions regarding the duration and severity of the pandemic and the global macroeconomic impacts of the pandemic however we are unable to accurately predict the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business operations and financial condition due to the uncertainty of future developments in particular we believe the ultimate impacts on our business results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on among other things the further spread and duration of covid19 the requirements to take action to help limit the spread of the illness the availability safety and efficacy of a vaccine and treatments for covid19 and the economic impacts of the pandemic even in those regions where we are beginning to experience business recovery should those regions fail to fully contain covid19 or suffer a covid19 relapse those markets may not recover as quickly or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations the pandemic may also affect our business operations or financial condition in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks 

in addition the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this item 1a risk factors any of which could have a material effect on us 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world if global economic and financial market conditions further deteriorate or do not improve the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition

 if contract manufacturers of our products or other participants in our supply chain experience difficulty obtaining financing in the capital and credit markets to purchase raw materials or to finance capital equipment and other general working capital needs it may result in delays or nondelivery of shipments of our products 

our products services and experiences face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies private labels and large companies that have diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products our nike direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers which sell our products through their digital platforms and physical stores and with digital commerce platforms in addition we compete with respect to the digital experiences we are able to offer our consumers 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms digital services and experiences and social media presence are areas of intense competition this in addition to ongoing rapid changes in technology a reduction in barriers to the creation of new footwear and apparel companies and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel athletic equipment services and experiences constitute significant risk factors in our operations in addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers shop and the continued proliferation of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase demand for our products may decline possibly significantly or we may need to reduce wholesale or suggested retail prices for our products 

failure to maintain our reputation brand image and culture could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns on our digital platforms and through our digital experiences we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives 

our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity purpose and brand culture negative claims or publicity involving us our culture and values our products services and experiences consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate for example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image and diminish consumer trust in our brand social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations if the reputation culture or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal or covid19 related cancellations or postponements and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the nba finals olympics or the world cup among others in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions outbreaks of disease social or political unrest availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development play a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering digital technologies industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems and loss of consumer confidence 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken or statements made by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability

economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which creates exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdoms exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” or new or proposed us policy changes that impact the us dollar value relative to other international currencies our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

to meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our nike direct operations including our retail stores and digital platforms have required and will continue to require significant investment our nike direct stores have required and will continue to require substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities and to integrate with our digital platforms because of their unique design and technological elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our nike direct retail stores a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure temporary or 

2020 form 10k 12 

otherwise or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond our control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation 

in addition we have made significant investments in digital technologies and information systems for the digital aspect of our nike direct operations and our digital offerings will require co ntinued investment in the development and upgrading of our technology platforms in order to deliver highquality digital experiences our digital platforms must be designed effectively and work well with a range of other technologies systems networks and standards that we do not control we may not be successful in developing platforms that operate effectively with these technologies systems networks or standards a growing portion of consumers access our nike direct digital platforms but in the event that it is more difficult for consumers to access and use our digital platforms consumers find that our digital platforms do not effectively meet their needs or expectations or consumers choose not to access or use our digital platforms or use devices that do not offer access to our platforms the success of our nike direct operations could be adversely impacted our competitors may develop or have already developed digital experiences features content services or technologies that are similar to ours or that achieve greater acceptance 

we may not realize a satisfactory return on our investment in our nike direct operations and managements attention from our other business opportunities could be diverted which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

if the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop or interact with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally or to retain our customer base could be materially adversely affected 

many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping as well as to engage with us and our competitors through digital experiences that are offered on mobile platforms we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers or any failure to provide attractive digital experiences to our customers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations in addition as use of our digital platforms continues to grow we will need an increasing amount of technical infrastructure to continue to satisfy our consumers needs if we fail to continue to effectively scale and adapt our digital platforms to accommodate increased consumer demand our business may be subject to interruptions delays or failures and consumer demand for our products and digital experiences could decline 

risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts we cannot provide assurance however that the measures we take to secure and enhance these systems will be sufficient to protect our information technology systems and prevent cyberattacks system failures or data or information loss the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all

eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition further like other companies in the retail industry we have in the past experienced and we expect to continue to experience cyberattacks including phishing and other attempts to breach or gain unauthorized access to our systems to date these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

we are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the united states and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels if we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation the global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

changes to us or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions could impact our business financial condition and results of operations in particular political and economic instability geopolitical conflicts political unrest civil strife terrorist activity acts of war public corruption expropriation and other economic or political uncertainties in the united states or internationally could interrupt and negatively affect the sale of our products or other business operations any negative sentiment toward the united states as a result of any such changes could also adversely affect our business 

in addition changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business could adversely affect our business the us presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

changes or proposed changes in us or other countries trade policies may result in restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade tariffs and other changes in us trade policy have in the past and could in the future trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods further any emerging protectionist or nationalist trends either in the united states or in other countries could affect the trade environment the company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the united states and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof or the economy of another country in which we conduct operations our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

2020 form 10k 14 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights these actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective for example confidential information related to business strategy innovations new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation loss of intellectual property rights a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information about our wholesale customers and consumers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement adaptive products and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time any breach of our or our service providers network or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous and sometimes conflicting regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the united states europe and elsewhere for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 and california passed the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which became effective on january 1 2020 these laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provide certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under gdpr and ccpa and regulations can be costly and time consuming and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others imposition of fines by governmental authorities and damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products this includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the united states and elsewhere as further described below under “we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate” and “changes to us or other countries trade policies and tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and

results of operations” the us presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage us corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the united states which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations the administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain us multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

in addition disease outbreaks including the current covid19 pandemic terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

furthermore we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act as well as the anticorruption laws of other countries in which we operate although we implement policies and procedures designed to promote compliance with these laws our employees contractors and agents as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations may take actions in violation of our policies any such violation could result in sanctions or other penalties and have an adverse effect on our business reputation and operating results 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins changes in us trade policies including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition sojitz america performs importexport financing services and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain countries and any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz americas banks could have an 

2020 form 10k 16 

adverse effect on our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the countries in which sojitz provides services which could in turn adversely affect our sales and profitability 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate 

we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions for example effective january 1 2020 the tax law in the netherlands one of the companys major jurisdictions changed 

other proposals to reform foreign tax laws could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings we also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters these holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met the impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate for example in january 2019 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the netherlands has breached state aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the company if this matter is adversely resolved the netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the companys netherlands income taxes in the future could increase 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores and accelerating digital commerce capabilities the market shares of these retailers may increase through acquisitions and construction of additional stores and investments in digital capacity and as a result of attrition as struggling retailers exit the market consolidation of our retailers will concentrate our credit risk with a smaller set of retailers any of whom may experience declining sales or a shortage of liquidity including as a result of the covid19 pandemic in addition increasing market share concentration among a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find sufficient retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

we are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental 

2020 form 10k 17 

health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require our direct contractors and the contractors of our licensees to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors if one or more of our direct or indirect contractors violates or fails to comply with or is accused of violating or failing to comply with such standards and laws this could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition negative publicity regarding production methods alleged unethical or illegal practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses or result in the imposition of additional regulations including new or additional quotas tariffs product safety regulations or other regulatory measures by governmental authorities 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by 122 footwear factories located in 12 countries we do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2020  four footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2020 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61 of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2020  our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies or be unable to perform including as a result of the covid19 pandemic we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

certain of our manufacturers are highly specialized and only produce a specific type of product such manufacturing partners may go out of business if consumer preferences or market conditions change such that there is no longer sufficient demand for the types of products they produce if in the future the relevant products are again in demand and the specialized manufacturers no longer exist we may not be able to locate replacement facilities to manufacture certain products in a timely manner or at all which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities have in the past and could be interrupted by information technology problems disasters such as earthquakes or fires or outbreaks of disease or government actions taken to mitigate their spread any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing 

2020 form 10k 18 

locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues have in the past temporarily disrupted and could in the future disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors manufacturers and other suppliers or have in the past and could result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition in particular if a natural disaster were to occur in an area in which we or our suppliers manufacturers customers distribution centers and vendors are located our continued success would depend in part on the safety and availability of the relevant personnel and facilities and proper functioning of our or third parties computer telecommunication and other systems and operations in addition a severe weather event could negatively impact retail traffic to our stores or stores that carry our products and could have an adverse impact on consumer spending any of which could in turn result in negative pointofsale trends for our merchandise further climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters which may affect our business operations either in a particular region or globally as well as the activities of our thirdparty vendors and other suppliers manufacturers and customers in addition the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in changes in regulations or consumer preferences which could in turn affect our business operating results and financial condition we believe the diversity of locations in which we operate our operational size and our information technology systems position us well but if we were to experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity event we could still experience operational challenges in particular depending upon how a local or regional event may affect our human capital across our operations or with regard to particular aspects of our operations such as key executive officers or personnel further if we are unable to find alternative suppliers replace capacity at key manufacturing or distribution locations or quickly repair damage to our information technology systems or supply systems we could be late in delivering or be unable to deliver products to our customers these events could result in reputational damage lost sales cancellation charges or markdowns all of which could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our nike direct operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations see also “ our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties ” 

the success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel as well as our ability to maintain our workplace culture and values 

our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals or our workplace culture or values could harm our business our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel in addition shifts in us immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the united states w e also believe that our corporate culture has been a key driver of our success and we have invested substantial time and resources in building maintaining and evolving our culture any failure to preserve and evolve our culture could negatively affect our future success including our ability to retain and recruit employees

our business operations and financial performance could be adversely affected by changes in our relationship with our workforce or changes to united states or foreign employment regulations 

we have significant exposure to changes in domestic and foreign laws governing our relationships with our workforce including wage and hour laws and regulations fair labor standards minimum wage requirements overtime pay unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates citizenship requirements and payroll taxes which could have a direct impact on our operating costs a significant increase in minimum wage or overtime rates in countries where we have workforces could have a significant impact on our operating costs and may require that we relocate those operations or take other steps to mitigate such increases all of which may cause us to incur additional costs there is also a risk of potential claims that we have violated laws related to discrimination and harassment health and safety wage and hour laws criminal activity personal injury and other claims in addition if there were a significant increase in the number of members of our workforce who are members of labor organizations or become parties to collective bargaining agreements we could be vulnerable to a strike work stoppage or other labor action which could have an adverse effect on our business 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poors and moodys investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for our existing facilities or for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market or the capital markets could be adversely affected we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions within our articles of incorporation and oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products through nikeowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our “nike direct” operations to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “musthave” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail 

since fiscal 2018 through the consumer direct offense and our triple double strategy we have focused on doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed and agility to market and growing our direct connections with consumers in june 2020 we announced a new digitally empowered phase of the consumer direct offense strategy consumer direct acceleration this strategic acceleration will focus on three specific areas first creating the marketplace of the future through more premium consistent and seamless consumer experiences that more closely align with what consumers want and need this strategy will lead with nike digital and our own stores as well as through select strategic partners who share our marketplace vision second we will align our product creation and category organizations around a new consumer construct focused on men’s women’s and kids this approach allows us to create product that better meets individual consumer needs including more specialization of our category approach while realigning and simplifying our offense to accelerate our largest growth opportunities in particular we’ll be reinvesting in our women’s and kids’ businesses and will also simplify our operating model across the remainder of the company to optimize effectiveness third we will unify investments in data and analytics demand sensing insight gathering inventory management and other areas against an endtoend technology foundation to accelerate our digital transformation we believe this unified approach will accelerate growth and unlock more efficiency for our business while driving speed and responsiveness as we serve consumers globally 

on july 22 2020 management announced a series of leadership and operating model changes to streamline and speed up strategic execution these changes are expected to lead to a net loss of jobs resulting in pretax onetime employee termination costs of approximately 200 million to 250 million which is expected to be incurred primarily during the first half of fiscal 2021 in the form of cash expenditures these amounts are subject to change until such time as all details are finalized 

this next phase of our consumer direct offense is expected to drive sustainable growth and profitability as we accelerate nike to a digitalfirst company we are committed to the execution of this strategy despite the shortterm adverse impacts to our business from a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 as such our longterm financial goals on average per year remain the same and are outlined below 

 covid19 update 

covid19 was first identified in wuhan china in december 2019 and subsequently declared a pandemic by the world health organization to date covid19 has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world and resulted in travel restrictions and business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas as a result covid19 has impacted our business globally including through store closures reduced operating hours and decreased retail traffic in particular the outbreak and preventive measures taken to help curb the spread had material adverse impacts on our operations and business results in greater china during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 following the temporary closure of or reduced operating hours in approximately 75 of nikeowned and partner stores within the region during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 our results of operations were further impacted as approximately 90 of our nike brand stores across north america emea and apla excluding korea were closed for approximately 8 weeks the majority of converse direct to consumer stores were also closed for a significant portion of the fourth quarter additionally certain of our wholesale partners closed stores or reduced operating hours during the fourth quarter resulting in lower than expected sales and a slowing of receipt of shipments of our products the combined effect of store closures and reduced wholesale shipments caused higher than normal inventory levels at may 31 2020 as inventories grew 31 compared to the prior year in order to manage future inventory growth and ensure a return to normalized levels we are modifying our buying plans and canceling certain precovid19 factory purchases shifting product offer dates to meet nearterm demand as well as shifting available inventory into our digital channel and increasing digital fulfillment capacity specifically in 

2020 form 10k 27 

north america and emea additionally we are investing in targeted promotions and markdowns to accelerate liquidation of excess inventory while continuing to protect the longterm health of our product franchises 

covid19 also impacted our distribution centers our thirdparty manufacturing partners and other vendors including through the effects of facility closures reductions in operating hours labor shortages and real time changes in operating procedures to accommodate social distancing guidelines and additional cleaning and disinfection procedures 

in response to the uncertainty of the pandemic described above we enhanced our liquidity position during the fourth quarter through the issuance of 6 billion in senior unsecured notes the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program and by entering into a new committed credit facility agreement which provides for an additional 2 billion of borrowings refer to liquidity and capital resources for additional discussion  

throughout the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 our digital commerce remained open supported by the employees in the distribution centers during the fourth quarter nike brand digital remained our fastest growing channel growing 79 on a currencyneutral basis with each of our geographies growing over 50 beginning in midmay stores within our nike direct operations gradually began reopening as of july 17 2020 over 90 of our nike direct stores have reopened across the globe with 100 open in greater china over 90 open in both emea and north america and apla open over 70 as of july 17 2020 substantially all converse direct to consumer stores have reopened to serve consumers 

we continue to monitor the rapidly evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities including federal state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations in these circumstances there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan as such given the dynamic nature of this situation the company cannot reasonably estimate the impacts of covid19 on our future financial condition results of operations or cash flows however we do expect they will have a material adverse impact on our future revenue growth as well as our overall profitability and may continue to lead to higher than normal inventory levels in various markets revised payment terms with certain of our wholesale customers higher salesrelated reserves factory cancellation costs and a volatile effective tax rate driven by changes in the mix of earnings across the companys jurisdictions 

on march 27 2020 in response to covid19 the united states government enacted the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act the cares act is a relief package consisting of various stimulus measures such as tax payment deferrals various business incentives and makes certain technical corrections to the us tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the enactment of such legislation while favorable did not have a material impact on our fiscal 2020 consolidated financial statements 

fiscal 2020 overview 

fiscal 2020 nike inc revenues declined 4 to 374 billion as revenue growth of 7 for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 was more than offset by a 38 decline in the fourth quarter due to the impacts of covid19 the nike brand which represents over 90 of nike inc revenues  experienced a 4 decline down 2 on a currencyneutral basis driven by declines across nearly all geographies partially offset by 11 currencyneutral growth in greater china nike direct grew 8 on a currencyneutral basis driven by 49 growth in digital with all geographies growing strong double digits while wholesale revenues declined 7  revenues for converse declined 3 and 1  on a reported and currencyneutral basis respecti vely as revenue growth in asia was more than offset by declines in north america europe and licensee markets 

income before income taxes decreased 40 for fiscal 2020  primarily due to lower revenues and gross margin resulting from the impacts of covid19 as well as higher selling and administrative expense for the first nine months of fiscal 2020 gross margin expanded 30 basis points compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2019 however this was more than offset by a decline of 820 basis points in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due the impacts of covid19 for fiscal 2020 nike inc gross margin decreased 130 basis points as higher fullprice average selling price asp on a wholesale equivalent basis was more than offset by higher product costs due to incremental tariffs in the us as well as factory cancellation charges higher inventory obsolescence reserves and the negative rate impacts of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead expense partially offset by lower demand creation expense operating overhead expense increased due to higher wagerelated expenses as a result of our continued investment in endtoend digital capabilities and higher bad debt expense partially offset by lower travel and related spend demand creation expense decreased primarily due to lower retail brand presentation costs and sports marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed globally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 these decreases were partially offset by higher digital brand marketing costs 

diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2 decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program 

as we continue to execute against the consumer direct offense we are focused on optimizing country operating models across our global portfolio and we remain committed to investing in our most significant growth opportunities during the third quarter of fiscal 2020 we announced our intention to sell our nike brand businesses in brazil argentina chile and uruguay to strategic thirdparty distributors in an effort to more personally serve consumers in these respective marketplaces while driving

sustainable profitable growth these transactions are expected to close in the first half of fiscal 2021 as a result of this decision the related assets and liabilities of these entities were classified as heldforsale on the consolidated balance sheets as of may 31 2020 additionally we recognized a nonrecurring impairment charge of 405 million within other income expense net on the consolidated statements of income classified within corporate this charge was primarily due to the anticipated release of noncash cumulative foreign currency translation losses and could fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates up to the date of close in future quarters as we shift from a wholesale and direct to consumer operating model to a distributor operating model within these countries we expect consolidated nike inc and apla revenue growth will be reduced due to differences in commercial terms however we expect the future operating model to have a favorable impact on our overall profitability as we reduce selling and administrative expenses as well as lessen exposure to foreign exchange rate volatility 

on october 29 2019 we signed a definitive agreement to sell the assets and liabilities of our whollyowned subsidiary brand hurley the transaction closed on december 6 2019 and the impacts of the divestiture are not considered material to the company 

while foreign currency markets remain volatile in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger us dollar we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability we remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above

the following tables present nike brand revenues disaggregated by reportable operating segment distribution channel and major product line 



fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

on a currencyneutral basis nike inc revenues declined 2 for fiscal 2020  driven by lower revenues in both the nike brand and converse as the first nine months of revenue growth was offset by the impacts of lower shipments to wholesale customers and store closures within our nike direct and converse direct to consumer operations due to covid19 in the fourth quarter revenues for north america declined in fiscal 2020  reducing nike inc revenues by approximately 4 percentage points partially offset by revenue growth in greater china contributing approximately 2 percentage points 

on a currencyneutral basis nike brand footwear revenues decreased 2 for fiscal 2020  driven by declines in nearly all key categories primarily running sportswear and training partially offset by growth in the jordan brand unit sales of footwear decreased 8 partially offset by higher asp per pair contributing approximately 6 percentage points the increase in asp was primarily due to higher fullprice and nike direct asps as well as the favorable impact of growth in our nike direct business 

currencyneutral nike brand apparel revenues decreased 3 for fiscal 2020  due to declines in most key categories primarily running training and football soccer partially offset by growth in sportswear and the jordan brand unit sales of apparel decreased 8 partially offset by higher asp per unit contributing approximately 5 percentage points the increase in asp was primarily due to higher fullprice asp and the favorable impact of growth in our nike direct business

on a currencyneutral basis fiscal 2020 nike brand mens and womens revenues decreased 4 and 3  respectively lower nike brand mens revenues were driven by declines in nearly all key categories primarily running and training partially offset by growth in the jordan brand lower nike brand womens revenues were driven by declines in most key categories primarily running and training partially offset by growth in sportswear and the jordan brand revenues for our nike kids business decreased 3  as declines primarily in football soccer more than offset growth in the jordan brand

higher product costs were in part due to incremental tariffs in north america higher other costs primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of covid19 were specifically related to increased factory cancellations costs higher inventory obsolescence and the adverse rate impact of supply chain costs on a lower volume of wholesale shipments 

total selling and administrative expense 



 fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

demand creation expense decreased 4 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  due to lower retail brand presentation costs and lower sports marketing investments as well as decreased advertising and marketing expenses as sporting events were postponed or canceled and a majority of stores were closed globally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 these decreases were partially offset by higher digital brand marketing costs changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased demand creation expense by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2020  

operating overhead expense increased 7 for fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019  driven by higher wagerelated and administrative expenses to support our continued investments in endtoend digital capabilities including support for a new enterprise resource planning tool operating overhead expense was further impacted by higher bad debt expense recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 due to the impacts of covid19 these increases were partially offset by lower travel and related spend changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased operating overhead expense by approximately 1 percentage points for fiscal 2020

fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 

other income expense net changed from 78 million of other income net for fiscal 2019 to 139 million of other expense net for fiscal 2020  primarily due to the nonrecurring impairment charge of 405 million related to our planned strategic distributor partnership transition within apla for more information see note 20 — acquisitions and divestitures within the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements this was offset by a 121 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses including hedges

in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results in corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency exchange rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact 

2020 form 10k 41 

of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net  refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces nikes us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 

2020 form 10k 42 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in other income expense net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity  in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a detriment of approximately 867 million a detriment of approximately 1236 million and a benefit of approximately 832 million for the years ended may 31 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 212 million a detriment of approximately 233 million and a benefit of approximately 177 million for the years ended may 31 2020  2019 and 2018  respectively 

management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 management has concluded our argentina subsidiary within our apla operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market as a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the us dollar as of and for the period ended may 31 2020  this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated investments at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under us gaap we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of the purchase of us dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 91 million 97 million and 110 million on our income before income taxes for the years ended may 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with us gaap there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2020 and 2019  there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2020  2019 and 2018

cash provided used by investing activities was an outflow of 1028 million for fiscal 2020  compared to an outflow of 264 million for fiscal 2019  driven primarily by lower proceeds from the net change in shortterm investments during fiscal 2020  the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 27 million compared to 850 million in fiscal 2019  additionally during fiscal 2020 we continued investing in our infrastructure to support future growth specifically focused around digital capabilities our endtoend technology foundation our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain we expect this trend to continue in future periods 

cash provided used by financing activities was an inflow of 2491 million for fiscal 2020 compared to an outflow of 5293 million for fiscal 2019  primarily due to the net proceeds from a 5942 million corporate bond issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as lower share repurchases during fiscal 2020

capital resources 

on july 23 2019 we filed a shelf registration statement the “shelf” with the us securities and exchange commission sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time the shelf expires on july 23 2022 on march 27 2020 we issued 6 billion of senior unsecured notes with tranches maturing march 27 2025 march 27 2027 march 27 2030 march 27 2040 and march 27 2050 for additional information regarding our longterm debt refer to note 8 — longterm debt in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

on august 16 2019 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings up to 3 billion in total upon lender approval the facility matures on august 16 2024 with a oneyear extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 16 2026 this facility replaces the prior 2 billion credit facility agreement entered into on august 28 2015 which would have matured august 28 2020 on april 6 2020 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings in addition to the existing credit facility discussed above the new facility matures on april 5 2021 as of may 31 2020 and 2019  no amounts were outstanding under our committed credit facilities 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively as it relates to our committed credit facility entered into on august 16 2019 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate would increase conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease under the committed credit facility entered into on april 6 2020 if our longterm debt ratings were to decline only the interest rate would increase but would remain unchanged in the event our longterm debt rating were to improve changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities under these facilities we have agreed to various covenants these 

2020 form 10k 44 

covenants include limits on our disposal of assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2020  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 4 billion commercial paper program which we increased by 2 billion during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 during the fiscal year ended may 31 2020  the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was  1456 million as of may 31 2020  we had 248 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 165  no commercial paper was outstanding as of may 31 2019 

we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

to date in fiscal 2020 we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 

as of may 31 2020  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 88 billion  primarily consisting of commercial paper corporate notes deposits held at major banks money market funds us government sponsored enterprise obligations us treasury obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2020  the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 14 days 

we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may determine to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt given our existing structure if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings we would be required to accrue and pay withholding taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations

in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 in addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur refer to note 9 — income taxes and note 13 — benefit plans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2020  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below

new accounting pronouncements 

refer to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted accounting standards 

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit  finance committee of the board of directors 

these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements as of a given date because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

on june 1 2018 we adopted accounting standards update asu no 201409 revenue from contracts with customers topic 606  using the modified retrospective method of adoption prior to fiscal 2019 amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies our revenue recognition policies under topic 606 are described 

2020 form 10k 46 

in the following paragraphs and references to prior period policies under accounting standard codification topic 605 — revenue recognition are included below in the event they are substantially different 

revenue transactions associated with the sale of nike brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels we satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer based on the terms of sale a customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment prior to fiscal 2019 the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer the transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions 

as part of our revenue recognition policy consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers we estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against revenues with an offsetting increase to accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized the estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets prior to fiscal 2019 reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within accounts receivable ne t for wholesale transactions and accrued liabilities for our direct to consumer business on the consolidated balance sheets 

the provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date 

estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded if actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 

refer also to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies and note 16 — revenues for additional information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory reserves 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales  if changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant amount of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to demand creation expense may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in cost of sales as the related sales occur for contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we 

2020 form 10k 47 

record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within demand creation expense  

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income  in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from accumulated other comprehensive income loss into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of the designated amount of anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when the designated amount of anticipated or actual transactions decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to other income expense net during the quarter in which the decrease occurs in rare circumstances the additional period of time may exceed two months due to extenuating circumstances related to the nature of the forecasted transaction that are outside our control or influence 

income taxes 

we are subject to taxation in the united states as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws on an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense  the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

we have not recorded withholding tax expense for foreign earnings we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested within certain of our foreign jurisdictions the amount of earnings indefinitely reinvested offshore is due to the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore operations and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities withholding tax consequences are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination is based on expected working capital and other capital needs in jurisdictions where the earnings are generated the possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us operations may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional withholding tax expense in the year we determined amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore 

2020 form 10k 48 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax act which significantly changed previous us tax laws including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes the tax act also transitions us international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonus earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to us taxation certain provisions of the tax act including a provision to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of foreign subsidiaries were not effective for the company until fiscal 2019 in accordance with us gaap the company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the gilti provision as a current period expense 

implementation of the tax act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 we completed our analysis of the tax act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded 

refer to note 9 — income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 

2020 form 10k 49 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12 to 24 months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100 of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2020 are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro japanese yenus dollar and chinese yuanus dollar currency pairs refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 48 million and 34 million at may 31 2020 and 2019  respectively the var increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2020  such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 126 million and 83 million during fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019  respectively 

2020 form 10k 50 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt and fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results of operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss upon consolidation of this subsidiary

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2019  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina brazil canada india south africa and uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 5 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment nike also advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements changes in us trade policies including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods may negatively affect us corporations with production activities outside the us including nike there have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods which could negatively affect us corporations with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the us government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations we source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer markets outside of the united states and we have an ethics and compliance program to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nikes business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nikes business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nikes policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products our nike direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers selling our products 

8        nike inc 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations in addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping and the rising trend of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives 

our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture negative claims or publicity involving us our products consumer data or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate for example while we require our suppliers of our products to operate their business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations we do not control their practices negative publicity relating to a violation or an alleged violation of policies or laws by such suppliers could damage our brand image social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development play a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures including artists designers and influencers to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional 

2019 form 10k 9 

athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes public figures or sports organizations to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

general economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdoms impending exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” or new or proposed us policy changes that impact the us dollar value relative to other international currencies our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 



10        nike inc 

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the nba finals olympics or the world cup among others in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customers financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

to meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

2019 form 10k 11 

our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our nike direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our nike direct operations a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the companys control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business 

if the technologybased systems that give our consumers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our consumers shop with us through our digital platforms increasingly consumers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our consumers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with consumers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights these actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective for example confidential information related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely inadvertently or improperly used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we handle transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement adaptive products and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate social 

12        nike inc 

engineering such as phishing and largescale complex automated attacks that can evade detection for long periods of time any breach of our or our service providers network or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers users or employees personal information or a disruption of our business any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the us europe and elsewhere for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 and california passed the california consumer privacy act the ccpa which will go into effect in 2020 these laws impose additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under gdpr and ccpa and regulations can be costly any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

we are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

failure of our contractors or our licensees contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition negative publicity regarding production methods alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products this includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the us and elsewhere as further described below under “we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate”  and “changes to us trade policy tariff and importexport regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations”  the us presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage us corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the us which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations the administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain us multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

2019 form 10k 13 

in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate 

we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which includes a number of significant changes to previous us tax laws that impact us including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes the tax act also transitions us international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonus earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to us taxation 

implementation of the tax act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 we completed our analysis of the tax act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions there have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings we also utilize tax rulings and other agreements to obtain certainty in treatment of certain tax matters these holidays and rulings expire in whole or in part from time to time and may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met the impact of any changes in conditions would be the loss of certainty in treatment thus potentially impacting our effective income tax rate for example in january 2019 the european commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether the netherlands has breached state aid rules when granting certain tax rulings to the company if this matter is adversely resolved the netherlands may be required to assess additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and the companys netherlands income taxes in the future could increase 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are also engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

changes to us trade policy tariff and importexport regulations or our failure to comply with such regulations may have a material adverse effect on our reputation business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business as well as any negative sentiment toward the us as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business the us presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

as a result of recent policy changes of the us presidential administration and recent us government proposals there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade the new tariffs and other changes in us trade policy has in the past and could continue to trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted 

14        nike inc 

or are considering imposing retaliatory measures on certain us goods the company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the us and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterpartys liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by 112  footwear factories located in 12  countries we do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2019  four  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2019  footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 61  of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2019  our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

2019 form 10k 15 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins changes in us trade policies including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for the company during fiscal 2019 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina brazil canada india south africa and uruguay collectively the “sojitz markets” excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz americas banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem which may not be sufficient to cover all eventualities and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease 

16        nike inc 

economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers headquarters and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our digital commerce operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we are subject to a complex array of laws and regulations and litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to and must comply with extensive laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels if we or our employees agents suppliers and other partners fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations such failure could subject us to fines sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation business financial condition and results of operations we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation the global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks such as antibribery anticorruption fraud trade environmental competition privacy and other regulatory matters will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert managements attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

the success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel 

our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals could harm our business our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel in addition shifts in us immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the us 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2019 swoosh llc beneficially owned approximately 78 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2019 all of these shares were converted into class b common stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 16 the shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh llc the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial 

2019 form 10k 17 

number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock swoosh llc was formed by philip h knight our chairman emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock swoosh llc is controlled by mr knights son and nike director travis knight 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poors and moodys investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions within our articles of incorporation and oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts opinions of our future performance which may in part be based upon any guidance we have provided analysts estimates are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of managements attention and resources needed to successfully run our business

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products through nikeowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our “nike direct” operations to retail accounts and to a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “musthave” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail 

through the consumer direct offense we are focusing on our triple double strategy with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers as a result of the execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals through fiscal 2023 on average per year are as follows 

 fiscal 2019 was our first full year executing against our new strategy and our results demonstrated the power of the nike inc portfolio to generate revenue growth while investing in capabilities to fuel our next phase of longterm growth and profitability we achieved record revenues in fiscal 2019 growing 7 to 391 billion the nike brand which represents over 90 of nike inc revenues  delivered 8 revenue growth fueled by investments in innovative products and digital platforms on a currencyneutral basis nike brand revenues grew 11 driven by growth across all geographies nike direct and wholesale nearly all key categories and doubledigit growth across footwear and apparel within our nike direct business digital outpaced all other channels growing at 35 in fiscal 2019 revenues for converse increased 1 and 3 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively primarily driven by doubledigit growth in asia and digital which was partially offset by declines in the us and europe 

income before income taxes  increased 11 for fiscal 2019 as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense nike inc gross margin increased 90 basis points primarily due to higher fullprice average selling price asp on a wholesale equivalent basis favorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates and growth in nike direct these benefits were partially offset by higher product costs selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues reflecting investments in data and analytics capabilities digital commerce platforms and an initial investment in a new enterprise resource planning tool to accelerate our endtoend digital transformation additionally we prioritized investments in global brand campaigns aimed at deepening our connection with consumers 

diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2 decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program 

while foreign currency markets remain volatile in part due to geopolitical dynamics leading to a stronger us dollar we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above

use of nongaap financial measures 

throughout this annual report on form 10k we discuss nongaap financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” references to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our nike brand market footprint if we had no nike direct operations nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our nike direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers additionally currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

management uses these nongaap financial measures when evaluating the companys performance including when making financial and operating decisions additionally management believes these nongaap financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends however references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap measures used by other companies

the currencyneutral increase in nike brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2019  was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories most notably sportswear unit sales of apparel increased 6 and higher asp per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth primarily due to higher fullprice asp in part reflecting lower discounts as well as higher nike direct asp

other income expense net 



other income expense net  comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2019   compared to   fiscal 2018   

other income expense net  changed from 66 million  of other expense net for fiscal 2018  to 78 million  of other income net for fiscal 2019  primarily due to a 136 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses including hedges

income taxes 



fiscal 2019   compared to   fiscal 2018   

our effective tax rate was 161  for fiscal 2019  compared to 553 for fiscal 2018 due to significant changes related to the enactment of the us tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” in the prior year and a reduction in the us federal statutory rate to 21 in the current year these decreases were partially offset by an increase in us tax on foreign earnings due to the impact of global intangible lowtaxed income gilti

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 14 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar reduces inventory costs incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within   inventories   and is recognized in   cost of sales   when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through   other income expense net  refer to   note 14 — risk management and derivatives   in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices reduces nikes us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

36        nike inc 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges except for hedges of the embedded derivative components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are recognized in other income expense net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income loss  within shareholders equity  in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues  was a detriment of approximately 1236 million a benefit of approximately 832 million and a detriment of approximately 542 million for the years ended may 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our  income before income taxes  was a detriment of approximately 233 million a benefit of approximately 177 million and a detriment of approximately 115 million for the years ended may 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 management has concluded our argentina subsidiary within our apla operating segment is operating in a hyperinflationary market as a result beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 the functional currency of our argentina subsidiary changed from the local currency to the us dollar as of and for the period ended may 31 2019 this change did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition and we do not anticipate it will have a material impact in future periods based on current rates 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated investments at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under us gaap we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of the purchase of us dollar denominated availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

2019 form 10k 37 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 97 million 110 million and 59 million on our income before income taxes  for the years ended may 31 2019 2018 and 2017 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with us gaap there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2019 and 2018 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2019 2018 and 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations  was 5903 million  for fiscal 2019  compared to 4955 million  for fiscal 2018  net income adjusted for noncash items generated 5341 million  of operating cash flow for fiscal 2019  compared to 3473 million  for fiscal 2018  the net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase to cash provided by operations of 562 million  for fiscal 2019  compared to an increase to cash provided by operations of 1482 million  for fiscal 2018  the primary driver of the change in working capital relates to the accrual of 1172 million for the transition tax under the tax act during fiscal 2018 refer to note 9 — income taxes for additional information on the tax act cash provided by operations  in fiscal 2019  was further impacted by the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging transactions during fiscal 2019  we received cash collateral of 266 million compared to 23 million in fiscal 2018  in addition the change in accounts receivable net  decreased cash provided by operations  by 457 million  in fiscal 2019  primarily driven by revenue growth 

cash provided used by investing activities  was an outflow of 264 million  for fiscal 2019  compared to an inflow of 276 million  for fiscal 2018  driven primarily by the net change in shortterm investments during fiscal 2019  the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 850 million  compared to an inflow of 1326 million  in fiscal 2018  

in fiscal 2020 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth including corporate facilities expanding our digital capabilities and new nike direct stores we continue to expect such investments to approximate 3 to 4 of revenues on average 

cash used by financing activities  was 5293 million  for fiscal 2019  compared to 4835 million  for fiscal 2018  with the increase primarily impacted by the repayment of notes payable during fiscal 2019  

in fiscal 2019  we purchased 543 million  shares of nikes class b common stock for 4283 million  an average price of  7886  per share during the third quarter of fiscal 2019  we concluded the fouryear 12 billion program authorized by our board of directors in november 2015 throughout this program we purchased a total of 1921 million shares for 12 billion an average price of 6247 per share immediately following the completion of this program we began repurchasing shares under the new fouryear 15 billion program authorized by our board of directors in june 2018 

as of may 31 2019 we had repurchased 116 million  shares at a cost of 986 million  an average price of 8472  per share under this new program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt the timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on july 21 2016 we filed a shelf registration statement the “shelf” with the sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time the shelf expired on july 21 2019 and we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2019 for additional information regarding our longterm debt refer to note 8 — longterm debt  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements

on august 28 2015 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings the facility matures august 28 2020 with a oneyear extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 2022 as of and for the periods ended may 31 2019  and 2018  we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2019  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 2 billion commercial paper program on june 1 2018 we repaid 325 million and had no additional borrowings under this program as of and for the year ended may 31 2019 we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

to date in fiscal 2019 we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 

as of may 31 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 47 billion  primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2019  the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 32 days 

we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2019  and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows 





2019 form 10k 39 

 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 in addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur refer to note 9 — income taxes  and note 13 — benefit plans  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2019  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below

revenue transactions associated with the sale of nike brand footwear apparel and equipment as well as converse products comprise a single performance obligation which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels we satisfy the performance obligation and record revenues when transfer of control has passed to the customer based on the terms of sale a customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product transfer of control passes to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer control passes to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment prior to june 1 2018 the requirements for recognizing revenue were met upon delivery to the customer the transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price less anticipated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions 

as part of our revenue recognition policy consideration promised in our contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions such as sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers we estimate the most likely amount we will be entitled to receive and record an anticipated reduction against revenues with an offsetting increase to accrued liabilities  at the time revenues are recognized the estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets  on the consolidated balance sheets prior to june 1 2018 the companys reserve balances were reported net of the estimated cost of inventory for product returns and recognized within accounts receivable ne t for wholesale transactions and accrued liabilities  for our direct to consumer business on the consolidated balance sheets 

the provision for anticipated sales returns consists of both contractual return rights and discretionary authorized returns provisions for postinvoice sales discounts consist of both contractual programs and discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted at a later date 

estimates of discretionary authorized returns discounts and claims are based on 1 historical rates 2 specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers and outstanding discounts and claims and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and may differ from estimates recorded if actual or expected future returns discounts or claims were significantly different than reserves established a reduction or increase to net revenues would be recorded in the period in which such determination was made 

refer also to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  and note 16 — revenues  for additional information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales  if changes in market conditions result in reductions to the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant amount of our demand creation expense  relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in demand creation expense  ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorsers performance adjustments to demand creation expense  may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products which we record in cost of sales  as the related sales occur for contracts containing minimum guaranteed royalty payments we record the amount of any guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product within demand creation expense  

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income  in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  into net income  sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from accumulated other comprehensive income loss  to other income expense net  during the quarter in which the decrease occurs 

income taxes 

we are subject to taxation in the united states as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws on an interim basis we estimate our effective tax rate for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes  excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense  the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

42        nike inc 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense  in the period when such determination is made 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax act which significantly changed previous us tax laws including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes the tax act also transitions us international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonus earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to us taxation certain provisions of the tax act including a provision to tax global intangible lowtaxed income gilti of foreign subsidiaries were not effective for the company until fiscal 2019 in accordance with us gaap the company has made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due under the gilti provision as a current period expense 

implementation of the tax act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 we completed our analysis of the tax act in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and no adjustments were made to the provisional amounts recorded 

refer to note 9 — income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12  to 24  months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100  of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2019  are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro chinese yuanus dollar and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs refer to note 14 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 34 million and 93 million at may 31 2019 and 2018 respectively the var decreased yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2019 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 83 million and 260 million during fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 respectively 

44        nike inc 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  upon consolidation of this subsidiary

we focus our nike brand product offerings in six key categories running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer training and sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as american football baseball cricket lacrosse skateboarding tennis volleyball wrestling walking and outdoor activities 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products sportswear running and the jordan brand are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales 

we also sell sports apparel covering the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and highquality construction sportswear training and running are currently our topselling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 — operating segments and related information  of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment in june 2017 we announced a new company alignment designed to allow nike to better serve the consumer personally at scale as a result of this organizational realignment the company’s reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america europe middle east  africa emea greater china and asia pacific  latin america apla and include results for the nike jordan and hurley brands sales through our nike direct operations are managed within each geographic operating segment

we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receives continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste 

in addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air lunar zoom free flywire drifit flyknit flyweave zoomx react and nike technologies throughout our running nike basketball jordan brand football soccer training and sportswear categories among others typifies our dedication to designing innovative products 



we are supplied by 124  footwear factories located in 13  countries the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 9  of total fiscal 2018  nike brand footwear production virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories for fiscal 2018  contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 47 26 and 21 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in argentina india brazil mexico and italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries for fiscal 2018  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2018  air manufacturing innovation with facilities near beaverton oregon and in st charles missouri as well as independent contractors in china and vietnam were our suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place nike’s independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2018  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina brazil canada india south africa and uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 6 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2019 



our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the implementation of or potential changes in foreign and domestic trade policies increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment changes in us trade policies including new and potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods may negatively affect us corporations with production activities outside the us including nike there have also been discussions and commentary regarding retaliatory actions by countries affected by the new tariffs and other changes in us trade policy and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain us goods which could negatively affect us corporations with business operations andor consumer markets in those countries depending on the extent that certain new or proposed reforms are implemented by the us government and the manner in which foreign governments respond to such reforms it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition  with respect to proposed trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers china ’ s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

nike advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements 

our international operations are also subject to compliance with the us foreign corrupt practices act or fcpa and other antibribery laws applicable to our operations we source a significant portion of our products from and have important consumer markets outside of the united states and we have policies and procedures to address compliance with the fcpa and similar laws by us our employees agents suppliers and other partners 



the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas anta asics li ning lululemon athletica puma under armour and vf corporation among others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world important aspects of competition in this industry are 

 we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 



we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against thirdparty theft and infringement 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike and swoosh trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements for certain trade dress we have sought and obtained trademark registrations 

we have copyright protection in our design graphics and other original works in some instances we also obtain registered copyrights 

we own patents and have a license under other patents which facilitate our use of “air” technologies 

we file for own and maintain many us and foreign utility patents as well as many us and foreign design patents protecting components technologies materials manufacturing techniques features functionality and industrial and aesthetic designs used in and for the manufacture of various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel athletic equipment and digital devices and related software applications these patents expire at various times 

we believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions 

however we have followed a policy of filing patent applications in the united states and select foreign countries on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable we also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against thirdparty infringement 



as of may 31 2018  we had approximately 73100  employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees management is committed to maintaining an environment where all nike employees have the opportunity to reach their full potential none of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the asia pacific  latin america geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or by organizations similar to a union in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements nike has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nike’s business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products our nike direct operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers selling our products 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations in addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping and the rising trend of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our nike direct and wholesale operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives 

our brand value also depends on our ability to maintain a positive consumer perception of our corporate integrity and brand culture negative claims or publicity involving us our products or any of our key employees endorsers sponsors or suppliers could seriously damage our reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate social media which accelerates and potentially amplifies the scope of negative publicity can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could also damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or if we receive negative publicity then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development play a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes or public figures to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

general economic factors beyond our control and changes in the global economic environment including fluctuations in inflation and currency exchange rates could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states and we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to the volatility of global economic conditions including fluctuations in inflation and foreign currency exchange rates additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdom’s impending exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and new or proposed us policy changes our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the company’s foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the nba finals olympics or the world cup among others in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

failure to accurately forecast consumer demand could lead to excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

to meet anticipated demand for our products we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

our nike direct operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our nike direct stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our nike direct operations a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us through our digital platforms increasingly customers are using mobilebased devices and applications to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers’ brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we periodically discover counterfeit reproductions of our products or products that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property rights continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim we infringe on their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights these actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective for example confidential information related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risk our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by or negative publicity involving a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our or our service providers’ network or other vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers’ users’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation resulting in lost sales and consumers fines lawsuits or significant legal and remediation expenses we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data in the us europe and elsewhere for example the european union adopted the general data protection regulation the “gdpr” which became effective on may 25 2018 the gdpr imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored compliance with existing proposed and recently enacted laws including implementation of the privacy and process enhancements called for under gdpr and regulations can be costly any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition negative publicity regarding production methods alleged practices or workplace or related conditions of any of our suppliers manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our brand image and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers manufacturers or licenses 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products this includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union as well as new and proposed changes affecting tax laws and trade policy in the us and elsewhere as further described below under “ we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate ” and “ changes to us trade policy tariff and importexport regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations  ” the us presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage us corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the us which may require us to change the way we conduct business and adversely affect our results of operations the administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain us multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws additional tax liabilities or increased volatility in our effective tax rate 

we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax laws and regulations or their interpretation and application in any jurisdiction subject to significant change on december 22 2017 the us enacted the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” which includes a number of significant changes to previous us tax laws that impact us including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 for tax years beginning after december 31 2017 among other changes the tax act also transitions us international taxation from a worldwide system to a modified territorial system and includes base erosion prevention measures on nonus earnings which has the effect of subjecting certain earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to us taxation 

implementation of the tax act required us to record incremental provisional tax expense in fiscal 2018 which increased our effective tax rate in fiscal 2018 adjustments to the incremental provisional tax expense may be made in future periods as actual amounts may differ due to among other factors a change in interpretation of the applicable revisions to the us tax code and related tax accounting guidance changes in assumptions made in developing these estimates regulatory guidance that may be issued with respect to the applicable revisions to the us tax code and state tax implications as we complete our analysis of the tax act we may make adjustments to provisional amounts we have recorded which could negatively impact our business results of operations or financial condition changes or challenges to or the repeal of the tax act cannot be predicted with certainty and could have a material impact on our future tax expense 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions there have been proposals to reform foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time these tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays and rulings are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate our effective income tax rate would increase in the future 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals particularly in light of the enactment of the tax act the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

changes to us trade policy tariff and importexport regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

changes in us or international social political regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade manufacturing development and investment in the territories or countries where we currently sell our products or conduct our business as well as any negative sentiment toward the us as a result of such changes could adversely affect our business the us presidential administration has instituted or proposed changes in trade policies that include the negotiation or termination of trade agreements the imposition of higher tariffs on imports into the us economic sanctions on individuals corporations or countries and other government regulations affecting trade between the us and other countries where we conduct our business it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes 

as a result of recent policy changes of the us presidential administration and recent us government proposals there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade the new tariffs and other changes in us trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain us goods the company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by changes to the trade policies of the us and foreign countries including governmental action related to tariffs international trade agreements or economic sanctions such changes have the potential to adversely impact the us economy or certain sectors thereof our industry and the global demand for our products and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by 124  footwear factories located in 13  countries we do not own or operate any of the footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2018  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2018  footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2018  our ability to meet our customers’ needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship including due to changes in applicable trade policies we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins changes in us trade policies including new and potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for the company during fiscal 2018 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina brazil canada india south africa and uruguay collectively the “sojitz markets” excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our digital commerce operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the us and other jurisdictions in which we have operations and distribution channels we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability antitrust trademark rights and a variety of other matters it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation the global nature of our business means legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition the adoption of new laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations may result in significant unanticipated legal and reputational risks any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

the success of our business depends in part on highquality employees including key personnel 

our success depends in part on the continued service of highquality employees including key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of key individuals or any negative perception with respect to these individuals could harm our business our success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel in addition shifts in us immigration policy could negatively impact our ability to attract hire and retain highly skilled employees who are from outside the us 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2018 swoosh llc beneficially owned more than 77 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2018 all of these shares were converted into class b common stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 17 the shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh llc the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock swoosh llc was formed by philip h knight our chairman emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock swoosh llc is controlled by mr knights son and nike director travis knight 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions within our articles of incorporation and oregon law intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products through nikeowned retail stores and through digital platforms which we refer to collectively as our “nike direct” operations to retail accounts and a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms and at retail 

in june 2017 we announced the consumer direct offense a new company alignment designed to allow nike to better serve the consumer personally at scale leveraging the power of digital nike plans to drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation moving even closer to the consumer through key cities and deepening onetoone connections as a result of this organizational realignment beginning in fiscal 2018 the company’s reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america europe middle east  africa emea greater china and asia pacific  latin america apla 

through the consumer direct offense we are focusing on our triple double strategy with the objective of doubling the impact of innovation increasing our speed to market and growing our direct connections with consumers as a result of the execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals through fiscal 2023 on average per year are as follows 

 over the past ten years we have achieved strong growth in many of these metrics during this time revenues for nike inc have grown 7 on an annual compounded basis annual gross margin has ranged from 435 to 464 diluted earnings per common share has grown steadily and our return on invested capital has been as high as 347 

our fiscal 2018 results demonstrated the power of the nike inc portfolio to generate revenue growth while investing in capabilities in support of our triple double strategy to fuel our next phase of longterm growth and profitability we achieved record revenues for fiscal 2018 growing 6 to 364 billion the nike brand which represents over 90 of nike inc revenues  delivered 7 revenue growth on a currencyneutral basis nike brand revenues grew 5 driven by strong revenue growth across all international geographies and nike direct as well as growth in footwear apparel and most key categories revenues for converse decreased 8 and 11 on a reported and currencyneutral basis respectively primarily driven by lower revenues in north america 

income before income taxes  decreased 11 for fiscal 2018 in part reflecting the negative impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates revenue growth was more than offset by higher selling and administrative expense gross margin contraction and a shift to other expense net from other income net for fiscal 2017 nike inc gross margin decreased 80 basis points primarily due to foreign currency exchange rate headwinds selling and administrative expense was higher as a percent of revenues reflecting investments in digital capabilities consumer experiences and product and brand marketing to drive longterm growth under the consumer direct offense 

diluted earnings per common share reflects a 2 decline in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program 

while foreign currency markets remain volatile we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above 

use of nongaap financial measures 

throughout this annual report on form 10k we discuss nongaap financial measures including references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues which should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” references to wholesale equivalent revenues are intended to provide context as to the total size of our nike brand market footprint if we had no nike direct operations nike brand wholesale equivalent revenues consist of 1 sales to external wholesale customers and 2 internal sales from our wholesale operations to our nike direct operations which are charged at prices comparable to those charged to external wholesale customers additionally currencyneutral revenues are calculated using actual exchange rates in use during the comparative prior year period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of translation arising from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 

management uses these nongaap financial measures when evaluating the company ’ s performance including when making financial and operating decisions additionally management believes these nongaap financial measures provide investors with additional financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends however references to wholesale equivalent revenues and currencyneutral revenues should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with us gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled nongaap measures used by other companies 



  



revenues 



 fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017 

on a currencyneutral basis nike inc revenues  grew 4 for fiscal 2018 driven by growth in the nike brand all international nike brand geographies delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2018 as our consumer direct offense delivered innovative products deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers through digital platforms and at nikeowned and retail partner stores driving demand for nike brand products revenue growth was broadbased as greater china emea and apla each contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the increase in nike inc  revenues  for fiscal 2018 lower revenues from north america and converse each reduced nike inc revenues by approximately 1 percentage point 

on a currencyneutral basis nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 4 and 9 respectively for fiscal 2018 while nike brand equipment revenues decreased 4 on a category basis the increase in nike brand footwear revenues was due to strong growth in sportswear and running which was partially offset by lower revenues in several other categories most notably the jordan brand footwear unit sales for fiscal 2018 increased 2 and higher average selling price asp per pair contributed approximately 2 percentage points of footwear revenue growth primarily due to the favorable impact of growth in our nike direct business 

the currencyneutral increase in nike brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2018 was fueled by growth in nearly all key categories most notably sportswear nike basketball and football soccer unit sales of apparel increased 4 and higher asp per unit contributed approximately 5 percentage points of apparel revenue growth primarily due to higher asps from fullprice offprice and nike direct sales 

for fiscal 2018 nike direct revenues represented approximately 30 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 28 for fiscal 2017 on a currencyneutral basis nike direct revenues increased 12 for fiscal 2018 driven by strong digital commerce sales growth of 25 the addition of new stores and 4 comparable store sales growth comparable store sales include revenues from nikeowned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met 1 the store has been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year on a reported basis digital commerce sales which are not included in comparable store sales were 28 billion for fiscal 2018 compared to 22 billion for fiscal 2017 and represented approximately 27 of our total nike brand nike direct revenues for fiscal 2018 compared to 24 for fiscal 2017 

on a wholesale equivalent and currencyneutral basis fiscal 2018 nike brand men’s revenues increased 5 as growth in sportswear running and nike basketball more than offset lower football soccer and jordan brand revenues women’s revenues increased 2 led by growth in sportswear partially offset by a decline in training revenues for our young athletes’ business decreased 1 as growth in football soccer was more than offset by lower revenues in the jordan brand 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016

 total selling and administrative expense 



 fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017

other expense income net 



other expense income net  comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

other expense income net  changed from 196 million of other income net for fiscal 2017 to 66 million of other expense net for fiscal 2018 primarily due to a 287 million net detrimental change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses including hedges 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other expense income net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 110 million for fiscal 2018 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

other expense income net  increased from 140 million of other income net for fiscal 2016 to 196 million of other income net for fiscal 2017 primarily due to a 56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses

income taxes 



fiscal 2018  compared to fiscal 2017   

our effective tax rate was 553 for fiscal 2018 reflecting the impact of the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” the impact of the tax act primarily reflects provisional expense of 1875 million for the onetime transition tax on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings and 158 million resulting from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities the remaining provisions of the tax act which were a net benefit to the effective tax rate did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during fiscal 2018 the increase in the effective tax rate resulting from the tax act was partially offset by the tax benefit from stockbased compensation in the current period as a result of the adoption of accounting standards update asu 201609 in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 

refer to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of asu 201609 and note 9 — income taxes for additional information on the impact of the tax act 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company “ntc” and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar decreases inventory costs incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories  and is recognized in cost of sales  when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other expense income net  refer to note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthe ning us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike’s us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with us gaap except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under us gaap accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense income net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues  was a benefit of approximately 832 million and a detriment of approximately 542 million for the years ended may 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes  was a benefit of approximately 177 million and a detriment of approximately 115 million for the years ended may 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

management generally identifies hyperinflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a threeyear period exceeds 100 beginning in fiscal 2019 we anticipate the functional currency of our argentina subsidiary within our apla operating segment will change from the local currency to us dollars as the subsidiary will be operating in a hyperinflationary market as a result its nonus dollar denominated monetary assets and liabilities will now be subject to remeasurement and recorded in other expense income net  within the consolidated statements of income beginning in fiscal 2019 although we continue to evaluate the impact at current rates we do not anticipate the remeasurement to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 110 million and 59 million on our income before income taxes  for the years ended may 31 2018 and 2017 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for in accordance with us gaap there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2018 and 2017 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2018 and 2017 



cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations  was 4955 million  for fiscal 2018  compared to 3846 million  for fiscal 2017  net income adjusted for noncash items generated 3473 million  of operating cash flow for fiscal 2018  compared to 4781 million  for fiscal 2017  the net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in an increase of 1482 million  for fiscal 2018 compared to a decrease of 935 million  for fiscal 2017 impacting the change in working capital during fiscal 2018 was the accrual of 1172 million for the transition tax under the tax act which will be paid in cash over an eightyear period refer to note 9 — income taxes for additional information on the tax act cash provided by operations was also impacted by the change in accounts receivable net  which decreased 187 million  primarily due to improved collection timing compared to an increase of 426 million  in fiscal 2017 

cash provided used by investing activities  was an inflow of 276 million  for fiscal 2018  compared to an outflow of 1008 million  for fiscal 2017  driven primarily by the net change in shortterm investments during fiscal 2018  the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 1326 million  compared to an inflow of 118 million  in fiscal 2017  

in fiscal 2019 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth including corporate facilities expanding our digital capabilities and new nike direct stores we continue to expect such investments to approximate 3 to 4 of revenues on average 

cash used by financing activities  was 4835 million  for fiscal 2018  compared to 2148 million  for fiscal 2017  the increase in cash used by financing activities  was primarily driven by 1482 million  of net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in fiscal 2017 which did not recur in fiscal 2018 the increase in cash used by financing activities  was also impacted by increased repurchases of common stock which resulted in a cash outflow of 4254 million  for fiscal 2018 compared to an outflow of 3223 million  for fiscal 2017  

in fiscal 2018  we purchased 697 million  shares of nike’s class b common stock for 4267 million  an average price of  6125  per share under the fouryear 12 billion program approved by the board of directors in november 2015 as of may 31 2018 we had repurchased 1494 million  shares at a cost of 8704 million  an average price of 5825  per share under this program although the timing and number of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions we currently anticipate completing this program during fiscal 2019 in june 2018 our board of directors approved a new fouryear 15 billion program to repurchase shares of nike’s class b common stock which we anticipate will commence at the completion of our current program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt 

capital resources 

on july 21 2016 we filed a shelf registration statement the “shelf” with the sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities from time to time the shelf expires on july 21 2019 for additional detail refer to note 8 — longterm debt  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

on august 28 2015 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings the facility matures august 28 2020 with a oneyear extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 2022 as of and for the periods ended may 31 2018  and 2017  we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2018  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 2 billion commercial paper program during the year ended may 31 2018  the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was 14 billion as of may 31 2018  there were 325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2019 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

to date in fiscal 2018 we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs however future volatility in the capital markets may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets 

as of may 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 52 billion  primarily consisting of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2018  the weightedaverage days to maturity of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 33 days 

we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2018  and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 in addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur refer to note 9 — income taxes  and note 13 — benefit plans  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2018  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2018  the company had letters of credit outstanding totaling 165 million  these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 



refer to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards 



our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit  finance committee of the board of directors 

these policies require we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date we base our estimates on 1 historical rates of product returns discounts and claims 2 specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to operating overhead expense  in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales  if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant amount of our demand creation expense  relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed on a straightline basis over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are reported in demand creation expense  ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorser’s performance in these instances to the extent actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance adjustments to demand creation expense  may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales  as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense  uniformly over the contract term 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income  in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income  into net income  sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income  to other expense income net  during the quarter in which the decrease occurs 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

income taxes 

we are subject to taxation in the united states as well as various state and foreign jurisdictions the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes  excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense  the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense  in the period when such determination is made 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  

on december 22 2017 the united states enacted the tax act which significantly changes previous us tax laws including provisions for a onetime transition tax on deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 as well as other changes in accordance with us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” we recorded provisional amounts which represent reasonable estimates of the effects of the tax act for which the analysis is not yet complete as the company completes its analysis of the tax act including collecting preparing and analyzing necessary information performing and refining calculations and obtaining additional guidance from the us internal revenue services irs us treasury department financial accounting standards board fasb or other standard setting and regulatory bodies on the tax act it may record adjustments to the provisional amounts which may be material in accordance with sab 118 the company’s accounting for the tax effects of the tax act will be completed during the measurement period which should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date 

refer to note 9 — income taxes   in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12  to 24  months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100  of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2018  are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs  refer to note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities 



we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding oneyear period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 93 million and 97 million at may 31 2018 and 2017 respectively the var decreased yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2018 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 260 million and 161 million during fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  upon consolidation of this subsidiary

there has been no change of accountants nor any disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure required to be reported under this item 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

we carry out a variety of ongoing procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of may 31 2018  

“management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting” is included in item 8 of this report 

we have continued several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems these are longterm initiatives which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes we will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout the transformation 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores internet websites and mobile applications which we refer to collectively as our “direct to consumer” or “dtc” operations and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad 



  

we focus our nike brand product offerings in nine key categories running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer men’s training women’s training action sports sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products and golf mens training includes our baseball and american football product offerings we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket lacrosse tennis volleyball wrestling walking and outdoor activities 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in the development and manufacturing of our products sportswear running and the jordan brand are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales 

we also sell sports apparel covering the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and highquality construction sportswear men’s training and running are currently our topselling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos 

we sell a line of performance equipment and accessories under the nike brand name including bags socks sport balls eyewear timepieces digital devices bats gloves protective equipment and other equipment designed for sports activities we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary nike ihm inc doing business as air manufacturing innovation 

our jordan brand designs distributes and licenses athletic and casual footwear apparel and accessories predominantly focused on basketball using the jumpman trademark sales and operating results for jordan brand products are reported within the respective nike brand geographic operating segments 

one of our whollyowned subsidiary brands hurley headquartered in costa mesa california designs and distributes a line of action sports and youth lifestyle apparel and accessories under the hurley trademark sales and operating results for hurley products are included within the nike brands north america geographic operating segment with sales reported within the action sports category 

another of our whollyowned subsidiary brands converse headquartered in boston massachusetts designs distributes and licenses casual sneakers apparel and accessories under the converse chuck taylor all star one star star chevron and jack purcell trademarks operating results of the converse brand are reported on a standalone basis 

in addition to the products we sell to our wholesale customers and directly to consumers through our dtc operations we have also entered into license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture and sell using nikeowned trademarks certain apparel digital devices and applications and other equipment designed for sports activities 



  

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 — operating segments and related information  of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors

we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste 

in addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air lunar zoom free flywire drifit flyknit flyweave zoomx react and nike technologies throughout our running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer mens training womens training and sportswear categories among others typifies our dedication to designing innovative products 



we are supplied by approximately 127  footwear factories located in 15  countries the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 8  of total fiscal 2017  nike brand footwear production virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories for fiscal 2017  contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 46 27 and 21 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent contract manufacturers in argentina india brazil mexico and italy to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries for fiscal 2017  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production 

we are supplied by approximately 363  apparel factories located in 37  countries the largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 13  of total fiscal 2017  nike brand apparel production virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories for fiscal 2017  contract factories in china vietnam and thailand produced approximately 26 16 and 10 of total nike brand apparel respectively for fiscal 2017  one  apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 43  of nike brand apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2017  air manufacturing innovation with facilities near beaverton oregon and in st charles missouri as well as independent contractors in china and vietnam were our suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place nikes independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2017  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina brazil canada india south africa thailand and uruguay excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 6 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to may 31 2019 



our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic and political conditions have affected international trade and increased protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment current us policy proposals including potential tariffs or penalties on imported goods if enacted may negatively affect us corporations with production activities outside the us including nike there have also been discussions and commentary regarding potential changes to us trade policies if any of these reforms are implemented it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations in addition  with respect to trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

nike advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements 



the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas asics li ning lululemon athletica puma under armour and vf corporation among others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world important aspects of competition in this industry are 

 we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 



we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we pursue available protections of these rights and vigorously protect them against thirdparty theft and infringement 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike and swoosh trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements for certain trade dress we have sought and obtained trademark registrations 

we have copyright protection in our design graphics and other original works in some instances we also obtain registered copyrights 

we own patents and have a patent license facilitating our use of “air” technologies 

we file for own and maintain many us and foreign utility patents as well as many us and foreign design patents protecting components technologies manufacturing techniques features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel athletic equipment and digital devices these patents expire at various times 

we believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions 

however we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the united states and select foreign countries on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable we also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against thirdparty infringement

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nike’s business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products our dtc operations both through our digital commerce operations and retail stores also compete with multibrand retailers selling our products 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service digital commerce platforms and social media presence are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations in addition the competitive nature of retail including shifts in the ways in which consumers are shopping and the rising trend of digital commerce constitutes a risk factor implicating our dtc and wholesale operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking applications or websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media mobile applications and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development play a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cuttingedge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues as well as other public figures to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or other public figures or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the high visibility or onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues or other endorsers associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or endorsers could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes or public figures to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes public figures and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdoms impending exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” and current us policy proposals our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events such as the olympics or the european football championship among others in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we utilize a futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we currently report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period and the relationship between reported futures and reported revenues in a given period has become less correlated over time based on our evolving business model differences are also due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales with short lead times closeout nike brand footwear and apparel all sales of nike brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our direct to consumer inline stores and digital commerce operations and sales from converse nike golf and hurley 

our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer distributor and consumer relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products we offer certain customers the opportunity to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens or as consumer behavior shifts retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing or changing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing retail environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity or consumer behavior shifts away from traditional retail it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

our direct to consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our direct to consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our direct to consumer operations a decline in sales a shift in consumer behavior away from brickandmortar retail or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our digital commerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us through our digital commerce website and mobile applications increasingly customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly digital commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of digital commerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our digital commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

risks specific to our digital commerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our digital commerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others we also may be unable to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of our confidential information and intellectual property rights such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and agreements relating to our collaborations with third parties and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information and intellectual property rights might not always be effective for example confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network or vendor systems may result in the loss of confidential business and financial data misappropriation of our consumers’ users or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business including unwanted media attention impairment of our consumer and customer relationships damage to our reputation and result in lost sales and consumers fines or lawsuits we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products this includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the effect of brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union as well as the current proposals affecting trade policy in the us the us presidential administration has indicated a focus on policy reforms that discourage us corporations from outsourcing manufacturing and production activities to foreign jurisdictions including through potential tariffs or penalties on goods manufactured outside the us if any of these reforms are implemented it may become necessary for us to change the way we conduct business which may adversely affect our results of operations the administration has also targeted the specific practices of certain us multinational corporations in public statements which if directed at us could harm our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business 

in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the united states subject to significant change there have been proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions if our capital or financing needs in the united states require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time these tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays and rulings are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate our effective income tax rate would increase in the future 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

proposed changes to us tax law or policy tariff and importexport regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

during and following the recent us presidential election there has been discussion and commentary regarding potential significant changes to us trade policies legislation treaties and tariffs including nafta and trade policies and tariffs affecting china there have also been discussions of a disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products it is unknown at this time whether and to what extent new legislation will be passed into law pending or new regulatory proposals will be adopted international trade agreements will be negotiated or the effect that any such action would have either positively or negatively on our industry or on us the company similar to many other multinational corporations does a significant amount of business that would be impacted by these changes if any new legislation andor regulations are implemented or if existing trade agreements are renegotiated it may be timeconsuming and expensive for us to alter our business operations in order to adapt to or comply with such changes such operational changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by approximately 127  footwear factories located in 15  countries we do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2017  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2017  footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2017  our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins current us trade policy proposals including potential changes to import tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements could also have a significant impact on our activities in foreign jurisdictions and could adversely affect our results of operations 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for the company during fiscal 2017 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay brazil canada india south africa and thailand collectively the “sojitz markets” excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers malware natural disasters vendor business interruptions or other causes or failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans or those of our vendors do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our digital commerce operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we are subject to litigation and other legal and regulatory proceedings which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

as a multinational corporation with operations and distribution channels throughout the world we are involved in various types of claims lawsuits regulatory proceedings and government investigations relating to our business our products and the actions of our employees and representatives including contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of any such legal or regulatory proceedings or investigations and we could in the future incur judgments fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits and claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations and negatively impact our reputation the global nature of our business means that legal and compliance risks will continue to exist and additional legal proceedings and other contingencies will arise from time to time which could adversely affect us in addition any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2017 swoosh llc beneficially owned more than 78 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2017 all of these shares were converted into class b common stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 16 the shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh llc the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock swoosh llc was formed by philip h knight our chairman emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock on june 30 2016 mr knight sold his voting interest in swoosh llc to a trust controlled by his son and nike director travis knight 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets hedge accounting for derivatives stockbased compensation income taxes and other contingencies our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile for any reason we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in reputational damage substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned inline and factory retail stores and nikeowned internet websites and mobile applications which we refer to collectively as our “direct to consumer” or “dtc” operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail online and through mobile applications 

in june 2017 we announced the consumer direct offense a new company alignment designed to allow nike to better serve the consumer personally at scale leveraging the power of digital nike will drive growth — by accelerating innovation and product creation moving even closer to the consumer through key cities and deepening onetoone connections 

in addition to achieving longterm sustainable revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

   delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced pricetovalue equation for consumers 

  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency product design and innovation 

  making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation help reduce waste and have longterm potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market and 

  driving growth in our higher gross margin dtc business led by digital commerce as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our dtc and wholesale operations 

   investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit 

  infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and 

  investments in key areas of future growth including our dtc business 

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals through fiscal 2020 on average per year are as follows 

 over the past ten years we have achieved many of our financial goals during this time revenues and diluted earnings per common share for nike inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 8 and 13 respectively on an annual compounded basis we expanded gross margin by approximately 70 basis points and our return on invested capital has increased from 219 to 347 

on november 19 2015 we announced a two forone split of both nike class a and class b common stock the stock split was in the form of a 100  percent stock dividend payable on december 23 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 9 2015 common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on december 24 2015 all share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split 

our fiscal 2017 results demonstrated the power of the nike inc portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability despite foreign currency headwinds we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2017 nike inc revenues  grew 6 to 344 billion net income  increased 13 and diluted earnings per common share grew 16 to 251 we also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth 

earnings before interest and income taxes “ebit” increased 7 for fiscal 2017 driven by revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage partially offset by gross margin contraction the increase in revenues was driven by growth across all nike brand geographies and converse footwear and apparel and several key categories this broadbased growth was primarily fueled by 

 nike inc gross margin decreased 160 basis points primarily due to higher product costs and foreign currency exchange rate headwinds which more than offset higher fullprice average selling price asp at current rates we anticipate foreign currency exchange rate headwinds will continue to negatively impact gross margin and net income  in fiscal 2018 

converse revenues increased 4 and ebit declined 2 as growth in direct distribution markets and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by lower gross margin primarily a result of the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs as well as the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions 

for fiscal 2017 the growth in net income  was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate of 550 basis points primarily due to a onetime benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the us internal revenue service irs of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the united states diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income  due to a 3 decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program 

while foreign currency markets remain volatile we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above 

use of nongaap financial measures

 reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period and have become less correlated due to our evolving business model this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and orders with shorter lead times and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales with short lead times closeout nike brand footwear and apparel all sales of nike brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our dtc inline stores and digital commerce operations and sales from converse nike golf and hurley 

gross margin 



fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016 

for fiscal 2017 our consolidated gross margin was 160 basis points lower than fiscal 2016 primarily driven by the following factors 

 fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

for fiscal 2016 our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015 primarily attributable to the following factors 



total selling and administrative expense 



 fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016 

demand creation expense  increased 2 for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 driven by higher sports marketing costs as well as higher marketing and advertising costs primarily to support key sporting events including the rio olympics and european football championship these increases were partially offset by lower retail brand presentation costs changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced demand creation expense  by approximately 1 percentage point 

operating overhead expense  was flat compared to fiscal 2016 as continued investments in our growing dtc business were offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation changes in foreign currency exchange rates reduced operating overhead expense  by approximately 1 percentage point for fiscal 2017 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

demand creation expense  increased 2 for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing including for our dtc business as well as support for key brand events and initiatives and sports marketing investments partially offset by lower advertising expense for fiscal 2016 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in demand creation expense  by approximately 6 percentage points 

operating overhead expense  increased 8 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of continued investments in our dtc business including new store openings and higher variable expenses as well as higher wagerelated expenses and investments in consumerfocused digital capabilities partially offset by lower variable compensation changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in operating overhead expense  by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016 

other income expense net 



other income expense net  comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

other income expense net  increased from 140 million of other income net for fiscal 2016 to 196 million of other income net for fiscal 2017 primarily due to a 56 million net beneficial change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 59 million for fiscal 2017 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

other income expense net  increased from 58 million of other income net for fiscal 2015 to 140 million of other income net for fiscal 2016 driven by a 26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in western europe and net gains from other nonoperating items 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 423 million for fiscal 2016 

income taxes 



fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

the 550 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to a onetime benefit in the first quarter of the fiscal year related to the resolution with the irs of a foreign tax credit matter and a decrease in foreign earnings taxed in the united states 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

the 350 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the united states which are generally subject to a lower tax rate

currencyneutral growth in apparel revenue was fueled by increases in most key categories led by sportswear and running for fiscal 2017 unit sales of apparel were flat while higher asp per unit contributed approximately 8 percentage points of apparel revenue growth the increase in asp per unit was primarily driven by higher fullprice asp in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories 

reported ebit decreased 9 in part reflecting the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily the argentine peso and mexican peso reported revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage were more than offset by lower gross margin gross margin decreased 430 basis points as higher fullprice asp was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily resulting from ongoing investments in our growing dtc business partially offset by administrative cost efficiencies demand creation expense also increased as lower advertising costs were more than offset by increased marketing support for the rio olympics in the first quarter as well as higher sports marketing costs 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

on a currencyneutral basis fiscal 2016 revenues for emerging markets increased 13 growth was attributable to higher revenues in 7 of 9 territories led by one of our largest territories soco which includes argentina uruguay and chile which grew 32 and by mexico and pacific which includes australia and new zealand which grew 31 and 27 respectively revenues declined 5 in brazil primarily reflecting ongoing macroeconomic challenges on a category basis revenues grew in nearly every key category led by sportswear and running dtc revenues increased 23 driven by the addition of new stores comparable store sales growth of 7 and digital commerce sales growth 

the constantcurrency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2016 was driven by higher revenues in nearly every key category most notably sportswear and running for fiscal 2016 unit sales of footwear increased 1 while higher asp per pair contributed approximately 13 percentage points of footwear revenue growth higher asp was attributable to higher fullprice asp primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higherpriced dtc business 

the constantcurrency growth in apparel revenue was due to increases in most key categories led by sportswear running and womens training fiscal 2016 unit sales of apparel decreased 2 while higher asp per unit contributed approximately 13 percentage points of apparel revenue growth higher asp was due to higher fullprice asp primarily reflecting inflationary conditions in certain territories and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of an increase in the proportion of revenues from our higherpriced dtc business 

on a reported basis ebit increased 9 despite the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates primarily the argentine peso mexican peso and korean won as gross margin expansion more than offset lower reported revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenues gross margin expanded 350 basis points due to higher fullprice asp lower warehousing and obsolescence costs and growth in our highermargin dtc business partially offset by shifts in mix to highercost products and unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates selling and administrative expense declined on a reported basis but was higher as a percent of revenues as higher operating overhead due to additional investments in our dtc business and higher wagerelated and variable compensation expenses were more than offset by changes in foreign currency exchange rates demand creation expense also increased driven by sports marketing and digital brand marketing costs offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange rates 

global brand divisions 



global brand divisions primarily represent demand creation operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the nike brand revenues for global brand divisions are primarily attributable to nike brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

global brand divisions’ loss before interest and taxes increased 3 for fiscal 2017 primarily due to higher demand creation expense which was only partially offset by a decline in operating overhead expense the increase in demand creation expense was due to higher marketing and advertising expenses for key brand and sporting events including the rio olympics and the european football championship in the first quarter operating overhead expense decreased as higher wagerelated expenses were more than offset by administrative cost efficiencies and lower variable compensation 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

global brand divisions’ loss before interest and taxes increased 15 for fiscal 2016 due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expense and to a lesser extent lower revenues largely resulting from the expiration of certain football club endorsement agreements operating overhead increased due to higher wagerelated expenses and consumerfocused digital capabilities partially offset by lower variable compensation expenses demand creation expense increased due to higher advertising and digital brand marketing expenses 

converse 



in territories we define as “direct distribution markets” converse designs markets and sells products directly to distributors and wholesale customers and to consumers through dtc operations the largest direct distribution markets are the united states the united kingdom and china we do not own the converse trademarks in japan and accordingly do not earn revenues in japan territories other than direct distribution markets and japan are serviced by thirdparty licensees who pay royalty revenues to converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016 

on a currencyneutral basis revenues for converse increased 6 for fiscal 2017 comparable direct distribution markets ie markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years grew 4 contributing approximately 4 percentage points of total converse revenue growth for fiscal 2017 comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 2 while higher asp per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of direct distribution markets revenue growth on a territory basis the increase in comparable direct distribution market revenues was primarily attributable to growth in the united states partially offset by lower revenues in europe conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution increased total converse revenues by approximately 2 percentage points for fiscal 2017 primarily driven by the market transition in italy revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 5 having an insignificant impact to total converse revenue the decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues is primarily due to lower revenues in latin america 

reported ebit declined 2 for fiscal 2017 as revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense were more than offset by gross margin contraction gross margin decreased 300 basis points as higher fullprice asp was more than offset by unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates and higher product costs primarily due to a shift in mix to lower margin products gross margin also contracted due to the unfavorable impact of lower licensing revenues primarily due to market transitions selling and administrative expense decreased due to lower demand creation expense primarily as a result of lower retail brand presentation costs partially offset by higher advertising expense operating overhead increased as higher wagerelated expenses were only partially offset by lower administrative costs 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates converse revenues increased 2 for fiscal 2016 comparable direct distribution markets grew 4 contributing approximately 3 percentage points of total converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016 comparable direct distribution market unit sales decreased 2 while higher asp per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of direct distribution market revenue growth on a territory basis growth in the united states and asia pacific was partially offset by declines in europe primarily the united kingdom conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution markets had an insignificant impact on total converse revenue growth for fiscal 2016 revenues from comparable licensed markets decreased 15 for fiscal 2016 reducing total converse revenue growth by approximately 1 percentage point the decrease in comparable licensed markets revenues was primarily due to poor macroeconomic conditions in latin america 

reported ebit for converse decreased 6 for fiscal 2016 as a decrease in reported revenues and lower gross margin more than offset selling and administrative expense leverage gross margin declined 220 basis points as unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates shifts in mix to highercost products and higher offprice mix more than offset higher fullprice asp selling and administrative expense declined faster than reported revenues primarily due to lower demand creation which more than offset slightly higher operating overhead due to higher wagerelated expenses 

corporate 



corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program 

the corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses 

in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results in corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments 

fiscal 2017  compared to fiscal 2016   

for fiscal 2017 corporates loss before interest and taxes decreased 449 million primarily due to the following 

 fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

for fiscal 2016 corporates loss before interest and taxes increased 76 million primarily due to the following 





overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company “ntc” and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories  and is recognized in cost of sales  when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net  refer to note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthe ning us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike’s us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with us gaap except for hedges of the embedded derivatives components of the product cost exposures and other contractual agreements as discussed above 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and embedded derivative contracts are not formally designated as hedging instruments under us gaap accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other income expense net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues  was a detriment of approximately 542 million and 1985 million for the years ended may 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes  was a detriment of approximately 115 million and 449 million for the years ended may 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 59 million and 423 million on our income before income taxes  for the years ended may 31 2017 and 2016 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for in accordance with us gaap there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2017 and 2016 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2017 and 2016 



cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations  was 3640 million  for fiscal 2017  compared to 3096 million  for fiscal 2016  net income adjusted for noncash items generated 4781 million  of operating cash flow in fiscal 2017  compared to 4676 million  for fiscal 2016  our fiscal 2017  change in working capital was a cash outflow  of 1141 million  compared to an outflow  of 1580 million  for fiscal 2016  the change in working capital was primarily due to the net change in cash collateral with derivative counterparties as a result of hedging activities for fiscal 2017 cash collateral received from counterparties which is recorded in accrued liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets decreased 105 million compared to a decrease of 863 million during fiscal 2016 refer to the credit risk section of note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail this decrease in cash collateral was partially offset by a 486 million increase in accounts receivable net  driven by higher revenues 

cash used by investing activities  was 1008 million  for fiscal 2017  compared to 1034 million  for fiscal 2016  driven primarily by the net change in shortterm investments and reverse repurchase agreements as well as additions of property plant and equipment during fiscal 2017  the net change in investments including sales maturities and purchases resulted in a cash inflow of 118 million  compared to an outflow of 57 million  in fiscal 2016  this change was partially offset by the maturity of reverse repurchase agreements of 150 million  in fiscal 2016  which did not recur in fiscal 2017  additions of property plant and equipment were 1105 million  in fiscal 2017 compared to 1143 million  in fiscal 2016  

in fiscal 2018 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth including corporate facilities new dtc stores and expanding our digital capabilities we continue to expect such investments will be approximately 4 of revenues on average 

cash used by financing activities  was 1942 million  for fiscal 2017  compared to 2671 million  for fiscal 2016  the decrease in cash used by financing activities  was primarily driven by increased proceeds from the issuance of debt and commercial paper in fiscal 2017 partially offset by higher dividends and lower excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements 

in fiscal 2017  we purchased 597 million  shares of nike’s class b common stock for 3249 million  an average price of  5443  per share under the fouryear 12 billion program approved by the board of directors in november 2015 as of may 31 2017 we had repurchased 798 million  shares at a cost of approximately 4437 million  an average price of 5563  per share under this program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows excess cash andor proceeds from debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on october 21 2016 we issued 15 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2026 and 2046 the 2026 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 10 billion at a 2375 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on november 1 2026 the 2046 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3375 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on november 1 2046 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year the issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of 1493 million refer to note 8 — longterm debt  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail on longterm debt  

on august 28 2015 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings the facility matures august 28 2020 with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 2022 as of and for the periods ended may 31 2017  and 2016  we had no amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt ratings were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt ratings would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2017  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 2 billion commercial paper program during the year ended may 31 2017  the maximum amount of commercial paper borrowings outstanding at any point was 919 million as of may 31 2017  there were 325 million of outstanding borrowings under this program we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2018 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

as of may 31 2017  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 62 billion  of which 58 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash equivalents  and shortterm investments  consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixedincome securities our fixedincome investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2017  the average duration of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 65 days 

to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt we would incur additional interest expense 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2017  and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 



in addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur refer to note 9 — income taxes  and note 13 — benefit plans  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2017  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2017  the company had letters of credit outstanding totaling 152 million  these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 



refer to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards 



our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates management has reviewed and discussed these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and digital commerce revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the united states precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date we base our estimates on 1 historical rates of product returns discounts and claims 2 specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to operating overhead expense  in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales  if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales  

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense  relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are recorded in demand creation expense  ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance increased or decreased demand creation expense  may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales  as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense  uniformly over the contract term 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income  in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income  into net income  sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income  to other income expense net  during the quarter in which the decrease occurs 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

income taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense  in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states thus reducing our overall income tax expense  the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense  in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense  would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes  excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense  the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12  to 24  months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100  of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2017  are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs  refer to note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixedrate debt of varying maturities 



we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 97 million and 109 million at may 31 2017 and 2016 respectively the var decreased yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2017 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 161 million and 209 million during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  upon consolidation of this subsidiary

our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and internet websites which we refer to collectively as our “direct to consumer” or “dtc” operations and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors nearly all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad 



  

we focus our nike brand product offerings in nine key categories running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer men’s training women’s training action sports sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products and golf mens training includes our baseball and american football product offerings we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket lacrosse tennis volleyball wrestling walking and outdoor activities 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on innovation and highquality construction in our products sportswear running the jordan brand and football soccer are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in footwear sales 

we also sell sports apparel covering the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear our sports apparel similar to our athletic footwear products is designed primarily for athletic use and exemplifies our commitment to innovation and highquality construction sportswear mens training running football soccer and womens training are currently our topselling apparel categories and we expect them to continue to lead in apparel sales we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 — operating segments and related information  of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk refer to item 1a risk factors 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment 

converse is also a reportable segment and operates in one industry the design marketing licensing and selling of casual sneakers apparel and accessories converse direct to consumer operations including ecommerce are reported within the converse operating segment results 



for fiscal 2016  nike brand and converse sales in the united states accounted for approximately 47  of total revenues compared to 46  for both fiscal 2015  and fiscal 2014  we sell our nike brand jordan brand hurley and converse products to thousands of retail accounts in the united states including a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts in the united states we utilize nike sales offices to solicit sales as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and skateboarding during fiscal 2016  our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25  of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal 2016  84  of our us wholesale footwear shipments were made under the futures program compared to 87  in fiscal 2015  and 86  in fiscal 2014  in fiscal 2016  66  of our us wholesale apparel shipments were made under the futures program compared to 67  in fiscal 2015  and 71  in fiscal 2014

no  customer accounted for 10  or more of our worldwide net revenues during fiscal 2016  



worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2016 were 149 billion compared with 138 billion for the same period last year nike brand reported futures include 1 orders from external wholesale customers and 2 internal orders from our dtc inline stores and ecommerce operations which are reflected at prices that are comparable to prices charged to external wholesale customers the us dollar futures orders amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales of atonce and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel all sales of nike brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our direct to consumer inline stores and ecommerce operations and sales from our converse hurley and nike golf businesses 



we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste 

in addition to our own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies we are simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories using market intelligence and research our various design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air lunar zoom free flywire drifit flyknit flyweave and nike technologies through running nike basketball the jordan brand football soccer mens training womens training and sportswear among others typifies our dedication to designing innovative products 



we are supplied by approximately 142  footwear factories located in 15  countries the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 7  of total fiscal 2016  nike brand footwear production virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories in fiscal 2016  contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 44 29 and 21 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina india brazil and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries in fiscal 2016  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production 

we are supplied by approximately 394  apparel factories located in 39  countries the largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 12  of total fiscal 2016  nike brand apparel production virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories in fiscal 2016  contract factories in china vietnam and indonesia produced approximately 26 23 and 9 of total nike brand apparel respectively in fiscal 2016  one  apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 39  of nike brand apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2016  nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike inc with facilities near beaverton oregon and in st charles missouri as well as independent contractors in china and vietnam were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place nikes independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2016  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay brazil canada india south africa and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 6 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to may 31 2019 



our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions we are actively monitoring actions that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment moreover with respect to trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

nike advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements the transpacific partnership tpp if ultimately ratified has the potential to reduce or eliminate high rates of customs duties for imports into the united states of nike products sourced from tpp countries primarily footwear and apparel from vietnam and apparel from malaysia similarly the european union has concluded a free trade agreement with vietnam that if approved could lead to duty reduction or elimination for footwear and apparel 



the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas asics li ning lululemon athletica puma vf corporation and under armour among others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear apparel and equipment in the world important aspects of competition in this industry are 

 we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 



we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements for certain trade dress we have sought and obtained trademark registrations 

we have copyright protection in our design graphics and other original works when appropriate we have sought registrations for this content 

we own patents and have a patent license facilitating our use of “air” technologies 

we also file and maintain many us and foreign utility patents as well as many us and foreign design patents protecting components manufacturing techniques features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear and apparel athletic equipment digital devices and golf products these patents expire at various times patents issued for original applications filed this calendar year in the united states may last until 2031 for design patents and until 2036 for utility patents 

we believe our success depends upon our capabilities in areas such as design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions however we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the united states and select foreign countries on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable we also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against thirdparty infringement 



as of may 31 2016  we had approximately 70700  employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or by organizations similar to a union in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements nike has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nike’s business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive both in the united states and worldwide we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service and social media presence are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us or by us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and digital dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally additionally there has been and may continue to be volatility in currency exchange rates as a result of the united kingdoms june 23 2016 referendum in which voters approved the united kingdoms exit from the european union commonly referred to as “brexit” our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations specifically amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of significant sporting events including without limitation the olympics and the european football championship in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and atonce orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales of atonce and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel all sales of nike brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our direct to consumer inline stores and ecommerce operations and sales from converse nike golf and hurley 

our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins reduced cash flows and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results financial condition and cash flows conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations financial condition and cash flows from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our customers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

our direct to consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our direct to consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our direct to consumer operations a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us through our ecommerce website and mobile commerce applications increasingly customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly ecommerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

risks specific to our ecommerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our ecommerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

in addition to our own sensitive and proprietary business information we collect transactional and personal information about our customers and users of our digital experiences which include online distribution channels and product engagement and personal fitness applications hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data misappropriation of our consumers’ users or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention materially damage our consumers customer relationships and our reputation and result in lost sales lost users fines or lawsuits we also may need to expend significant resources to protect against respond to andor redress problems caused by any breach 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data compliance with existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products this includes for example the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of brexit including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the united kingdom and its relationship with the european union in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we could be subject to changes in tax rates adoption of new tax laws or additional tax liabilities 

we are subject to the tax laws in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the united states subject to significant change there have been proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions if our capital or financing needs in the united states require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time these tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays and rulings are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate our future effective income tax rate would increase in the future 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the united states internal revenue service “irs” and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made for example the irs has assessed additional tax liabilities for 2011 and 2012 related to a foreign tax credit matter we are currently contesting the matter in us tax court in addition to the risk of additional tax for these years if this litigation is adversely determined and the irs was to seek similar adjustments in subsequent years we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities additionally we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe we have clearly reflected the economics of these transactions and the proper local transfer pricing documentation is in place tax authorities may propose and sustain adjustments that could result in changes that may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by approximately 142  footwear factories located in 15  countries we do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2016  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2016  footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2016  our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather natural and synthetic fabrics and threads nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for the company during fiscal 2016 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay brazil canada india south africa and thailand collectively the “sojitz markets” excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty hosted services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown for example our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate secure and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing and nike will continue to invest in these efforts the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers or other causes or our failure to properly maintain protect repair or upgrade our systems or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce consumer engagement and the marketing and use of our digital products and services we also rely on our ability to engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers any interruption in our information technology systems may impede our ability to engage in the digital space and result in lost revenues damage to our reputation and loss of users 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock by our principal stockholder could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2016 swoosh llc beneficially owned more than 78 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2016 all of these shares were converted into class b common stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 16 the shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh llc the sale or prospect of a sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock swoosh llc was formed by philip h knight our chairman emeritus to hold the majority of his shares of class a common stock on june 30 2016 mr knight sold his voting interest in swoosh llc to a trust controlled by his son and nike director travis knight 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventories contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets and goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned inline and factory retail stores and nikeowned internet websites which we refer to collectively as our “direct to consumer” or “dtc” operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 

in addition to achieving longterm sustainable revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

   delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced pricetovalue equation for consumers 

  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency product design and innovation 

  making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation help reduce waste and have longterm potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market and 

  driving growth in our higher gross margin dtc business led by nikecom as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our dtc and wholesale operations 

   investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit 

  infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and 

  investments in key areas of future growth including our dtc business 

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals through fiscal 2020 on average per year are as follows 

 over the past ten years we have achieved many of our financial goals during this time revenues and diluted earnings per common share for nike inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 8 and 13 respectively on an annual compounded basis we expanded gross margin by approximately 220 basis points and our return on invested capital has increased from 226 to 297 

on november 19 2015 we announced a twoforone stock split of both nike class a and class b common stock the stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on december 23 2015 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 9 2015 common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on december 24 2015 all share and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split 

our fiscal 2016 results demonstrated the power of the nike inc portfolio to deliver continued growth and expanding profitability despite significant foreign currency headwinds we achieved record revenues and earnings per share for fiscal 2016 nike inc revenues  grew 6 to 324 billion gross margin expanded 20 basis points net income  increased 15 and diluted earnings per common share grew 17 to 216 we also delivered strong cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth 

earnings before interest and income taxes ebit increased 10 for fiscal 2016 driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion while selling and administrative expense was flat as a percent of revenues the increase in revenues was attributable to growth for nearly every nike brand geography and across most key categories and product types this broadbased growth was primarily fueled by 

 converse revenues and ebit decreased 1 and 6 respectively as growth in direct distribution markets was more than offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

gross margin increased primarily due to higher fullprice average selling price and the favorable impact of growth in our highermargin dtc businesses partially offset by higher product costs primarily due to shifts in mix to highercost products and labor input cost inflation higher offprice mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

for fiscal 2016 the growth in net income  was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate of 350 basis points primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the united states which are generally subject to a lower tax rate diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income  due to a 1 decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program 

while foreign currency markets remain volatile we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and profitability and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above

by geography futures orders growth was as follows 



 the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and atonce orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales of atonce and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel all sales of nike brand equipment the difference between retail sales and internal orders from our dtc inline stores and ecommerce operations and sales from converse nike golf and hurley 

gross margin 



fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 

for fiscal 2016 our consolidated gross margin was 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015 primarily attributable to the following factors 

 fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

for fiscal 2015 our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2014 primarily driven by the following factors 



 total selling and administrative expense 



 fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015 

demand creation expense  increased 2 for fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to investments in digital brand marketing including for our dtc business as well as support for key brand events and initiatives and sports marketing investments partially offset by lower advertising expense for fiscal 2016 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in demand creation expense  by approximately 6 percentage points 

operating overhead expense  increased 8 compared to fiscal 2015 primarily as a result of continued investments in our dtc business including new store openings and higher variable expenses as well as targeted investments in operational infrastructure and consumerfocused digital capabilities partially offset by lower performancebased compensation changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in operating overhead expense  by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2016 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

demand creation expense  increased 6 for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to support for key brand and consumer events including the world cup in early fiscal 2015 increased digital brand marketing investments in dtc marketing and higher sports marketing expense changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in demand creation expense  by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2015 

operating overhead expense  increased 16 compared to the prior year primarily driven by investments in our rapidly growing dtc business including new store openings and higher variable expenses investments in operational infrastructure and consumerfocused digital capabilities and higher performancebased compensation for fiscal 2015 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in operating overhead expense  by approximately 3 percentage points 

other income expense net 



other income expense net  comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

other income expense net  increased from 58 million of other income net for fiscal 2015 to 140 million of other income net for fiscal 2016 driven by a 26 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses a favorable settlement of a legal judgment related to a bankruptcy case in western europe and net gains from other nonoperating items 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international business and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 423 million for fiscal 2016 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

other income expense net  shifted from 103 million of other expense net for fiscal 2014 to 58 million of other income net for fiscal 2015 primarily driven by a 147 million net change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses primarily due to significant hedge gains from availableforsale investments as well as an adverse legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in western europe 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international business and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 73 million for fiscal 2015 

income taxes 



fiscal 2016  compared to fiscal 2015   

the 350 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of earnings from operations outside the united states which are generally subject to a lower tax rate 

fiscal 2015  compared to fiscal 2014   

the 180 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories  and is recognized in cost of sales  when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net  refer to note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthe ning us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike’s us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost purchase exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other income expense net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues  was a detriment of approximately 1985 million and 1171 million for the years ended may 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes  was a detriment of approximately 449 million and 221 million for the years ended may 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 16 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 423 million and 73 million on our income before income taxes  for the years ended may 31 2016 and 2015 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2016 and 2015 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2016 and 2015 



cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations  was 3096 million  for fiscal 2016  compared to 4680 million  for fiscal 2015  our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2016  was net income  of 3760 million  our fiscal 2016  change in working capital was a net cash outflow  of 1580 million  as compared to a net cash inflow  of 256 million  for fiscal 2015  the change in working capital was primarily due to a net decrease in the amount of cash collateral received as a result of hedging activities refer to the credit risk section of note 16 — risk management and derivatives  for additional detail for fiscal 2016 cash collateral received from counterparties declined 863 million as compared to an increase in collateral received from counterparties of 968 million for fiscal 2015 

cash used by investing activities  was 1034 million  for fiscal 2016  compared to a 175 million  use of cash for fiscal 2015  the primary driver of the increase in cash used by investing activities  was the net change in shortterm investments including sales maturities and purchases from net salesmaturities to net purchases in fiscal 2016 there were 57 million  of net purchases of shortterm investments compared to 935 million  of net salesmaturities of shortterm investments in the same period of fiscal 2015 additions to property plant and equipment  were 1143 million  for fiscal 2016 as compared to 963 million  for fiscal 2015 the increase in additions to property plant and equipment  resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth primarily relating to supply chain and corporate initiatives as well as expansion of our dtc operations 

in fiscal 2017 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth as well as expand our digital capabilities we anticipate investing approximately 4 of revenue a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities new dtc stores and digital capabilities 

cash used by financing activities  was 2671 million  for fiscal 2016  compared to 2790 million  for fiscal 2015  a decrease of 119 million as increases in share repurchases and dividends were more than offset by the receipt of 981 million in net proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in october 2015 

in fiscal 2016  we purchased 554 million  shares of nike’s class b common stock for 3238 million  an average price of  5844  during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 we concluded the companys fouryear 8 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in september 2012 under this program the company purchased a total of 1971 million shares at a cost of 8 billion an average price of 4058 per share following the completion of this program the company began purchases under a fouryear 12 billion program approved by our board of directors in november 2015 of the total 554 million  shares repurchased in fiscal 2016 201 million  shares were purchased under this new program at a cost of approximately 1189 million  an average price of 5921  per share we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions

on april 23 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec which permitted us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities on april 23 2013 we issued 10 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 225 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2023 the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3625 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2043 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of 998 million on october 29 2015 we issued an additional 10 billion of senior notes at a 3875 fixed annual interest rate that will mature on november 1 2045 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year the issuance resulted in proceeds before expenses of 991 million the shelf expired on april 23 2016 we plan to file a new shelf registration statement with the sec in july 2016 

on august 28 2015 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 2 billion of borrowings the facility matures august 28 2020 with a one year extension option prior to any anniversary of the closing date provided that in no event shall it extend beyond august 28 2022 this facility replaces the prior 1 billion credit facility agreement entered into on november 1 2011 which would have matured november 1 2017 as of and for the periods ended may 31 2016  and 2015  we had no amounts outstanding under either committed credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as limits on the indebtedness we can incur relative to our net worth in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2016  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 2 billion commercial paper program which increased 1 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2016 during the year ended may 31 2016  we did not issue commercial paper and as of may 31 2016  there were no outstanding borrowings under this program any future issuance of commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2017 will depend on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

as of may 31 2016  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 55 billion  of which 46 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries included in cash and equivalents  as of may 31 2016 was 105 million  of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity cash equivalents  and shortterm investments  consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2016  the weighted average remaining duration of our cash equivalents and shortterm investments portfolio was 91 days 

to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt we would incur additional interest expense  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2016  and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 in addition to the above we have longterm obligations for uncertain tax positions and various postretirement benefits for which we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments will occur refer to note 9 — income taxes  and note 13 — benefit plans  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information related to uncertain tax positions and postretirement benefits respectively 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2016  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2016  the company had letters of credit outstanding totaling 157 million  these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 



refer to note 1 — summary of significant accounting policies  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for recently adopted and recently issued accounting standards 



our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the united states precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date we base our estimates on 1 historical rates of product returns discounts and claims 2 specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and 3 estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims are significantly greater or lower than established reserves we record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to operating overhead expense  in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales  if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales  

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense  relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are recorded in demand creation expense  ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance increased or decreased demand creation expense  may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales  as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense  uniformly over the contract term 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the twostep impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

fair value measurements 

for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments including us treasury securities 

in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as time deposits commercial paper and bonds us agency securities and money market funds 

level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our availableforsale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income  in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income  into net income  sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income  to other income expense net  during the quarter in which the decrease occurs 

we have used in the past and may use in the future forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries the change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income  within total shareholders’ equity  to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as other income expense net  during the period in which changes occur 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

income taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense  in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states thus reducing our overall income tax expense  the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense  in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense  would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes  excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense  the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12  to 24  months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100  of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2016  are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs  see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans fixedrate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixedrate debt as well as payfixed receivevariable forwardstarting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt 



we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 109 million and 117 million at may 31 2016 and 2015 respectively the var decreased yearoveryear as a result of a decrease in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio at may 31 2016 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 209 million and 205 million during fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

during the year ended may 31 2016 we entered into a series of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt these instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates 

details of thirdparty debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 



1 forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been included in the maturities category based on when the related forecasted debt issuance and corresponding swap terminations are expected to occur 

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  upon consolidation of this subsidiary 




 item 9 changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure 

there has been no change of accountants nor any disagreements with accountants on any matter of accounting principles or practices or financial statement disclosure required to be reported under this item 




 item 9a controls and procedures 

we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

we carry out a variety of ongoing procedures under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to evaluate the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures based on the foregoing our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of may 31 2016  

“management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting” is included in item 8 of this report 

we have commenced several transformation initiatives to centralize and simplify our business processes and systems these are longterm initiatives which we believe will enhance our internal control over financial reporting due to increased automation and further integration of related processes we will continue to monitor our internal control over financial reporting for effectiveness throughout the transformation 

there have not been any other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 18 — operating segments and related information  of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment as well as other macroeconomic operating and logisticsrelated factors 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic operating segment 

converse is also a reportable segment and operates in one industry the design marketing licensing and selling of casual sneakers apparel and accessories

worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2015 were 135 billion compared with 133 billion for the same period last year this futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our converse hurley and nike golf businesses 



we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort while reducing waste 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies nike is simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories using market intelligence and research the various nike design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air lunar zoom free flywire drifit flyknit flyweave and nike technologies through running basketball mens training womens training and sportswear among others typifies our dedication to designing innovative products 



we are supplied by approximately 146  footwear factories located in 14  countries the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 7  of total fiscal 2015  nike brand footwear production virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories in fiscal 2015  contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 43 32 and 20 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries in fiscal 2015  five  footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69  of nike brand footwear production 

we are supplied by approximately 408  apparel factories located in 39  countries the largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 11  of total fiscal 2015  nike brand apparel production virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers which often operate multiple factories in fiscal 2015  most of this apparel production occurred in china vietnam sri lanka thailand indonesia malaysia and cambodia in fiscal 2015  one  apparel contract manufacturer accounted for more than 10 of apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 36  of nike brand apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon polyester and canvas as well as polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2015  nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike inc with facilities near beaverton oregon and in st louis missouri and independent contractors in china and vietnam were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat and repel rain andor snow and plastic and metal hardware nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place nikes independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2015  sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines south africa and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 8 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2018 and contain a provision allowing us to extend the agreements to may 31 2019 



our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible increases in import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products and additional measures if implemented could adversely affect sales andor profitability for nike as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions in brazil and argentina we are actively participating in dumping investigations against footwear from china and actively monitoring actions in other countries that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may limit or delay customs clearance for imports of footwear apparel and equipment moreover with respect to trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing country and consumer market for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 

nike advocates for trade liberalization for footwear and apparel in a number of regional and bilateral free trade agreements the passage of trade promotion authority in the united states will enable the conclusion of the transpacific partnership tpp if ultimately passed the tpp has the potential to reduce or eliminate high rates of customs duties for imports into the united states of nike products sourced from tpp countries primarily footwear and apparel from vietnam and apparel from malaysia similarly the european union is close to concluding a free trade agreement with vietnam that could lead to duty reduction or elimination for footwear and apparel 



the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas li ning lululemon athletica puma vf corp under armour and uniqlo among others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear apparel and equipment in the world important aspects of competition in this industry are 

 we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 



we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions worldwide in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements for certain trade dress we have sought and obtained trademark registrations 

nike has copyright protection in its design graphics and other original works when appropriate we have sought registrations for this content 

nike owns patents and has a patent license facilitating its use of “air” technologies the air process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early patents directed to the “air” technologies have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike patents directed to the “air” technologies will not expire for several years 

we also file and maintain many us and foreign utility patents as well as many us and foreign design patents protecting components manufacturing techniques features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear apparel athletic equipment digital devices and golf products these patents expire at various times and patents issued for original applications filed this calendar year in the united states may last until 2030 for design patents and until 2035 for utility patents 

we believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in areas such as design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent and trade secret positions however we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the united states and select foreign countries on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable we also continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against thirdparty infringement 



as of may 31 2015  we had approximately 62600  employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or by organizations similar to a union in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements nike has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risks emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risks nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on nike’s business or the extent to which any risk or combination of risks may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production customer service and social media presence are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain or maintain highquality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers however as competition in our industry has increased the costs associated with establishing and retaining such sponsorships and other relationships have increased if we are unable to maintain our current associations with professional athletes sports teams and leagues or to do so at a reasonable cost we could lose the onfield authenticity associated with our products and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments as a result our brands net revenues expenses and profitability could be harmed 

furthermore if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world and most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment and in connection with the timing of global sporting events including without limitation the olympics and the world cup in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas transportation disruptions and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations shipping timing returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our converse hurley and nike golf businesses 

our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins cash flows and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our sales our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition when the retail economy weakens retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

our direct to consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our direct to consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our direct to consumer operations a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business 

if the technologybased systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively our operating results as well as our ability to grow our ecommerce business globally could be materially adversely affected 

many of our customers shop with us through our ecommerce website and mobile commerce applications increasingly customers are using tablets and smart phones to shop online with us and with our competitors and to do comparison shopping we are increasingly using social media and proprietary mobile applications to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience any failure on our part to provide attractive effective reliable userfriendly ecommerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers could place us at a competitive disadvantage result in the loss of ecommerce and other sales harm our reputation with customers have a material adverse impact on the growth of our ecommerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 

risks specific to our ecommerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our ecommerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we believe that our intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in enforcing our intellectual property continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and could result in a shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent the unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure and noncompete agreements and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price andor a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights including outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to the risk that our licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of our brands 

we currently license and expect to continue licensing certain of our proprietary rights such as trademarks or copyrighted material to third parties if our licensees fail to successfully market and sell licensed products or fail to obtain sufficient capital or effectively manage their business operations customer relationships labor relationships supplier relationships or credit risks it could adversely affect our revenues both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products 

we also rely on our licensees to help preserve the value of our brands although we attempt to protect our brands through approval rights over the design production processes quality packaging merchandising distribution advertising and promotion of our licensed products we cannot completely control the use of our licensed brands by our licensees the misuse of a brand by a licensee could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on us 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data misappropriation of our consumers’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention materially damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which our products are manufactured or where we sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries and are subject to the tax laws of those jurisdictions the companys most significant tax liabilities are incurred in the united states china and the netherlands if our capital or financing needs in the us require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the us subject to significant change there have been proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows 

our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes 

we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that the proper transfer pricing documentation is in place the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time these tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays and rulings are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate would increase in the future 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by approximately 146 footwear factories located in 14 countries we do not own or operate any of our own footwear manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the footwear products we sell in fiscal 2015 five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2015 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 69 of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2015 our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials natural and synthetic leather nylon canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train employ and retain adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise and increases in compliance costs due to governmental regulation concerning certain metals used in the manufacturing of our products in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 

because independent manufacturers make a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for the company during fiscal 2015 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines south africa and thailand collectively the sojitz markets excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty hosted services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing the failure of these systems to operate effectively including as a result of security breaches viruses hackers or other causes or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our reputation results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce and the marketing and use of our nike products and services we also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers distribution centers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in technology business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and engage our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares of common stock owned or managed by our chairman and related entities could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2015 philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors and swoosh llc an entity formed to manage 128500000 shares of class a common stock formerly owned by mr knight beneficially owned more than 82 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2015 all of the aforementioned class a common stock were converted into class b common stock the commensurate ownership percentage of our class b common stock would be approximately 177 the class a common stock shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws and the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing swoosh llc the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility to among other things incur additional indebtedness make restricted payments pledge assets as security make investments loans advances guarantees and acquisitions undergo fundamental changes and enter into transactions with affiliates failure to comply with such covenants could result in a default and as a result the commitments of our lenders under our credit agreements may be terminated and the maturity of amounts owed may be accelerated in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt 

if our internal controls are ineffective our operating results could be adversely affected 

our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations including the possibility of human error the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls including any failure to implement required new or improved controls or if we experience difficulties in their implementation our business and operating results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations 

if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect our operating results could be adversely affected 

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances as provided in “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets liabilities and equity and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventories contingent payments under endorsement contracts accounting for property plant and equipment and definitelived assets and goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors resulting in a decline in the price of our class b common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned inline and factory retail stores and nikeowned internet websites which we refer to as our “direct to consumer” or dtc operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 

in addition to achieving longterm sustainable revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

   delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a balanced pricetovalue proposition for consumers 

  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency product design and innovation 

  making our supply chain a competitive advantage by investing in new technologies that increase automation help reduce waste and have longterm potential to increase both customization of our products and speed to market and 

  driving growth in our higher gross margin dtc business as part of an integrated marketplace growth strategy across our dtc and wholesale operations 

   investments in consumer engagement that drive economic returns in the form of incremental revenue and gross profit 

  infrastructure investments that improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations and 

  increasing the productivity of our legacy infrastructure 

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals continue to be 

 over the past ten years we have achieved many of these financial goals during this time revenues and diluted earnings per common share for nike inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 8 and 13 respectively on an annual compounded basis our return on invested capital has increased from 232 to 281 and we expanded gross margins by approximately 150 basis points 

on november 15 2012 we announced a twoforone stock split of both class a and class b common shares the stock split was in the form of a 100 stock dividend payable on december 24 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business on december 10 2012 common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on december 26 2012 all share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split 

our fiscal 2015 results from continuing operations demonstrated nikes ongoing commitment to deliver consistent growth in revenues earnings and cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth despite significant foreign currency headwinds we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2015 nike inc revenues  grew 10 to 306 billion gross margin expanded 120 basis points net income from continuing operations  increased 22 to 33 billion and diluted earnings per common share increased 25 to 370 

earnings before interest and income taxes ebit from continuing operations increased 18 for fiscal 2015 driven by revenue growth and gross margin expansion which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense the increase in revenues was attributable to growth across nearly all nike brand geographies key categories and product types this broadbased growth was primarily fueled by 

 our converse business also grew with revenue and ebit growth of 18 and 4 respectively 

gross margin increased primarily due to higher average selling prices and the favorable impact of our highermargin dtc businesses partially offset by higher product input costs primarily a result of labor input cost inflation and shifts in mix to highercost products 

for fiscal 2015 the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate of 180 basis points primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions in addition diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2 decrease in the weighted average diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchase program 

while foreign currency markets remain volatile we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above

revenues 



 fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

on a currencyneutral basis revenues from nike inc continuing operations grew 14 for fiscal 2015 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and converse every nike brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2015 as our category offense continued to deliver innovative products deep brand connections and compelling retail experiences to consumers north america contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in nike inc revenues while western europe contributed 4 percentage points greater china contributed 2 percentage points and central  eastern europe emerging markets and converse each contributed 1 percentage point 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 17 and 10 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 1 during fiscal 2015 the increase in nike brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by strong performance in our sportswear basketball running and football soccer categories footwear unit sales in fiscal 2015 increased 9 and increases in average selling price per pair contributed approximately 8 percentage points of footwear revenue growth the increase in average selling price per pair was driven primarily by shifts in mix to higherpriced products and to a lesser extent the favorable impact of growth in our higherpriced dtc business 

the constantcurrency increase in nike brand apparel revenues for fiscal 2015 was driven by growth in most key categories led by sportswear running and womens training which were partially offset by a decline in football soccer due largely to the comparison to significant sales of replica apparel in advance of the world cup in 2014 fiscal 2015 unit sales of apparel increased 8 and increases in average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of apparel revenue growth the increase in average selling price per unit was driven primarily by increased revenues from our higherpriced dtc business 

while wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall nike brand revenues we continue to expand our dtc businesses in each of our geographies our nike brand dtc operations include nikeowned inline and factory stores as well as online sales through nikeowned websites for fiscal 2015 dtc revenues represented approximately 23 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 20 in fiscal 2014 on a currencyneutral basis dtc revenues grew 29 for fiscal 2015 driven by strong comparable store sales growth of 16 significant online sales growth and the addition of new stores comparable store sales include revenues from nikeowned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met 1 the store has been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year online sales through nikeowned websites which are not included in comparable store sales grew 59 in fiscal 2015 online sales represented approximately 18 of our total nike brand dtc revenues for fiscal 2015 compared to 15 for fiscal 2014 

on a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates fiscal 2015 nike brand men’s revenues increased 9 driven by growth in our sportswear basketball and running categories women’s revenues accelerated in fiscal 2015 achieving 20 growth primarily due to increases in sportswear running and womens training categories revenues in our young athletes business increased 19 as a result of continued efforts to expand footwear and apparel offerings for this group across multiple categories particularly basketball 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

on a currencyneutral basis revenues from nike inc continuing operations grew 11 for fiscal 2014 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and converse every nike brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014 north america contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in nike inc revenues while western europe and emerging markets each contributed 2 percentage points and central  eastern europe and converse each contributed 1 percentage point 

on a currencyneutral basis nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12 and 10 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 4 during fiscal 2014 the increase in nike brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our basketball sportswear running and football soccer categories footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per pair contributed approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth driven nearly equally by price increases and shifts in mix to higherpriced products 

for nike brand apparel the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories most notably our football soccer running and womens training categories in fiscal 2014 unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6 and the average selling price per unit contributed approximately 4 percentage points of apparel revenue growth driven by price increases and to a lesser extent a shift in mix to higherpriced products

on a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates fiscal 2014 nike brand mens revenues increased 9 mainly as a result of strong growth in our basketball football soccer running and sportswear categories womens revenues increased 12 in large part due to increases in our running sportswear and womens training categories the 16 increase in the young athletes business was driven by increases in the basketball and football soccer categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group 

futures orders 

futures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2015 were 2 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period the us dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period excluding the impact of currency changes futures orders increased 13 with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 5 percentage points of growth respectively 

by geography futures orders growth was as follows   



 the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and atonce orders and because the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales of atonce and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our dtc operations and sales from converse nike golf and hurley 

gross margin 



fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

for fiscal 2015 our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2014 primarily driven by the following factors 

 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

for fiscal 2014 our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2013 primarily driven by the following factors 

 

total selling and administrative expense 



 fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

demand creation expense  increased 6 for fiscal 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to support for key brand and consumer events including the world cup in early fiscal 2015 increased digital brand marketing investments in dtc marketing and higher sports marketing expense changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in demand creation expense  by approximately 4 percentage points for fiscal 2015 

operating overhead expense  increased 16 compared to the prior year primarily driven by investments in our rapidly growing dtc business including new store openings and higher variable expenses investments in operational infrastructure and consumerfocused digital capabilities and higher performancebased compensation for fiscal 2015 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased growth in operating overhead expense  by approximately 3 percentage points 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

demand creation expense  increased 10 compared to the prior year mainly driven by marketing support for events including the world cup higher sports marketing expense key product launches and initiatives and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts for fiscal 2014 changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on demand creation expense  

compared to the prior year operating overhead expense  increased 14 primarily attributable to growth in our dtc business driven by new store openings higher personnel costs and ecommerce launches as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on operating overhead expense  for fiscal 2014 

other income expense net 



other income expense net  comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

other income expense net  shifted from 103 million of other expense net for fiscal 2014 to 58 million of other income net for fiscal 2015 primarily driven by a 147 million change to net foreign currency conversion gains primarily due to significant hedge gains from availableforsale investments as well as an adverse legal judgment in the prior year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in western europe 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international business and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 73 million for fiscal 2015 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

other income expense net  shifted from 15 million   of other income net for fiscal 2013 to 103 million of other expense net for fiscal 2014 primarily driven by a 90 million adverse change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal judgment in the second quarter of fiscal 2014 related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in western europe 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currencyrelated gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes  of 139 million for fiscal 2014 

income taxes 



fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

the 180 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily due to the favorable resolution of audits in several jurisdictions 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

the 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended may 31 2014 we reached a resolution with the irs on an advanced pricing agreement this agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 refer to note 9 — income taxes  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure

the constant currency growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2015 was attributable to increases in several key categories most notably sportswear basketball action sports and running unit sales of footwear decreased 2 while average selling price per pair contributed approximately 11 percentage points of footwear revenue growth the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily due to price increases in response to inflationary conditions in certain latin american countries particularly argentina as well as shifts in mix to higherpriced products and the favorable impact of growth in our higherpriced dtc business 

constant currency apparel revenue growth was due to increases in nearly all key categories primarily sportswear running and womens training partially offset by a decline in football soccer revenues due to higher world cup sales in fiscal 2014 unit sales of apparel decreased 1 while average selling price per unit contributed approximately 6 percentage points of apparel revenue growth the increase in average selling price per unit was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our higherpriced dtc business and to a lesser extent price increases in response to inflationary conditions 

on a reported basis ebit decreased 14 primarily due to reported revenue declines lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense as well as  the impact of weakening foreign currency exchange rates  gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to unfavorable standard foreign currency exchange rates higher inventory obsolescence and higher offprice mix partially offset by higher average selling prices selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs primarily to support dtc growth as well as higher demand creation expense in part as a result of support for the world cup in early fiscal 2015 and higher sports marketing expense 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

excluding changes in currency exchange rates fiscal 2014 revenues for emerging markets increased 13 as a result of growth across nearly every territory our largest territory brazil grew 19 while our soco territory grew 25 mexico revenues decreased 3 largely as a result of shipping delays caused by issues with a distribution center transition in the first half of fiscal 2014 on a category basis revenues were higher in nearly every category led by football soccer running and sportswear 

constant currency footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in nearly every key category led by running sportswear football soccer and action sports unit sales for fiscal 2014 increased 4 and average selling price per pair contributed approximately 6 percentage points of footwear revenue growth the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain latin american territories and to a lesser extent shifts in mix to higherpriced products 

constant currency apparel revenue increased driven by growth in every key category most notably football soccer and running unit sales increased 11 and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 10 percentage points of apparel revenue growth primarily due to price increases in part reflecting inflationary conditions in certain latin american territories 

fiscal 2014 reported ebit decreased primarily due to a decline in gross margin higher selling and administrative expense and weaker currencies in a number of developing markets gross margin decreased 30 basis points due primarily to unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates higher product costs higher warehousing costs related to distribution center transition challenges in mexico and higher discounts which more than offset higher average selling prices selling and administrative expense increased due to higher operating overhead costs to support the expansion of our dtc business and infrastructure investments to support growth as well as increases in demand creation spending to support the world cup and key product launches 

global brand divisions 



global brand divisions primarily represent demand creation operating overhead and product creation and design expenses that are centrally managed for the nike brand revenues for global brand divisions are primarily attributable to nike brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment 

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

global brand divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 270 million in fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher operating overhead reflecting continued investments in operational infrastructure including digital capabilities consumer engagement and supply chain initiatives as well as higher performancebased compensation demand creation expense increased slightly due to support for the world cup in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 and key brand and consumer events 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

for fiscal 2014 global brand divisions loss before interest and taxes increased 277 million primarily driven by an increase in centrally managed product costs increased investments in our digital infrastructure as well as higher demand creation spending in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 to support the world cup and product creation and design initiatives 

converse 



in territories we define as “direct distribution markets” converse designs markets and sells products directly to distributors wholesale customers and to consumers through dtc operations the largest direct distribution markets are the united states the united kingdom and china converse does not own the converse trademarks in japan territories other than direct distribution markets and japan are serviced by thirdparty licensees who pay royalties to converse for the use of its registered trademarks and other intellectual property rights 

fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014   

excluding changes in currency exchange rates revenues for converse increased 21 for fiscal 2015 comparable direct distribution markets ie markets served under a direct distribution model for comparable periods in the current and prior fiscal years grew 14 contributing 12 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2015 comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12 and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 2 percentage points of converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth the united states market was the most significant contributor to the growth of comparable direct distribution markets due to volume increases with key wholesale customers and expansion of our dtc business conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 8 percentage points of total converse revenue growth for fiscal 2015 driven by conversion of several european markets most significantly ags austria germany and switzerland revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8 for fiscal 2015 contributing 1 percentage point of total converse revenue growth 

ebit for converse increased 4 for fiscal 2015 as strong revenue growth was partially offset by lower gross margin and higher selling and administrative expense gross margin decreased 60 basis points primarily due to transitions of licensed markets to direct distribution markets selling and administrative expense increased for fiscal 2015 primarily due to higher operating overhead costs resulting from investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth including market transitions new systems and new headquarters as well as higher intellectual property enforcement costs 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

excluding changes in currency exchange rates revenues for converse increased 15 for fiscal 2014 comparable direct distribution markets grew 13 contributing 10 percentage points of total revenue growth for fiscal 2014 primarily due to strength in our united states china and united kingdom markets comparable direct distribution market unit sales increased 12 and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 1 percentage point of converse comparable direct distribution market revenue growth conversion of markets from licensed to direct distribution contributed 4 percentage points of total converse revenue growth for fiscal 2014 revenues from comparable licensed markets increased 8 for fiscal 2014 contributing 1 percentage point of total converse revenue growth 

on a reported basis ebit at converse grew 17 for fiscal 2014 as higher revenues and gross margin were partially offset by higher selling and administrative expense gross margin increased 80 basis points primarily due to growth in highermargin territories and products within our direct distribution markets selling and administrative expense grew faster than revenue for fiscal 2014 due to higher operating overhead to support growth initiatives and dtc expansion as well as higher demand creation spending 

corporate 



corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program 

the corporate loss before interest and taxes consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation and certain foreign currency gains and losses 

in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results in corporate include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and converse related foreign currency hedge results conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and certain other foreign currency derivative instruments

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories  and is recognized in cost of sales  when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net  refer to note 17 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthe ning us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike’s us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost purchase exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other income expense net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 17 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income  within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues  was a detriment of approximately 1171 million and 288 million for the years ended may 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes  was a detriment of approximately 221 million and 49 million for the years ended may 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements  and note 17 — risk management and derivatives  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at each reported period end 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 73 million and 139 million on our income before income taxes  for the years ended may 31 2015 and 2014 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have in the past hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments these hedges are accounted for in accordance with the accounting standards for net investment hedges there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2015 and 2014 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2015 and 2014 



cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations  was 4680 million  for fiscal 2015  compared to 3013 million  for fiscal 2014  our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2015  was net income  of 3273 million  our fiscal 2015  change in working capital was a net cash inflow  of 256 million  as compared to a net cash outflow  of 488 million  for fiscal 2014  our investments in working capital decreased due to increases in accrued liabilities  primarily resulting from the receipt of 968 million  of cash collateral from counterparties as a result of hedging activity these amounts were partially offset by higher inventory levels resulting from business growth and west coast port delays in north america as well as lower income taxes payable  as a result of tax payments made in fiscal 2015 following the us unilateral advance pricing agreement reached with the irs in fiscal 2014 

cash used by investing activities  was 175 million  for fiscal 2015  compared to a 1207 million  use of cash for fiscal 2014  the primary driver of the decrease in cash used by investing activities  was the net change in shortterm investments including sales maturities and purchases from net purchases to net salesmaturities in fiscal 2015 there were 935 million  of net salesmaturities compared to 328 million  of net purchases of shortterm investments in the same period of fiscal 2014 additions to property plant and equipment  were 963 million  in fiscal 2015 as compared to 880 million  in fiscal 2014 the increase in additions to property plant and equipment  resulted from continued investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth primarily relating to expansion of our dtc operations as well as supply chain and corporate initiatives 

in fiscal 2016 we plan to continue investing in our infrastructure to support future growth as well as expand our digital capabilities we anticipate investing approximately 4 of revenue a portion of which will be used for the continued expansion of our corporate facilities new dtc stores and digital capabilities 

cash used by financing activities  was 2790 million  for fiscal 2015  compared to 2914 million  for fiscal 2014  a decrease of 124 million as increased dividends were more than offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the excess tax benefits from sharebased payment arrangements 

in fiscal 2015  we purchased 290 million  shares of nike’s class b common stock for 2534 million  an average price of  8737  during fiscal 2013 we completed the fouryear 5 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in september 2008 under that program we purchased a total of 1188 million shares at an average price of 4208 subsequently we began repurchases under a fouryear 8 billion program approved by the board in september 2012 as of the end of fiscal 2015  we had repurchased 809 million  shares at an average price of 7355  for a total cost of 5950 million  under this current program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on april 23 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities the shelf expires on april 23 2016 on april 23 2013 we issued 10 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 225 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2023 the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3625 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2043 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of 998 million 

on november 1 2011 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to 15 billion with lender approval the facility matures november 1 2017 as of and for the periods ended may 31 2015  and 2014  we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively if our longterm debt ratings were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2015  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program during the year ended may 31 2015  we did not issue commercial paper and as of may 31 2015  there were no outstanding borrowings under this program we may issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2016 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

as of may 31 2015  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 59 billion  of which 42 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries included in cash and equivalents  as of may 31 2015 was 968 million  of cash collateral received from counterparties as a result of hedging activity cash equivalents  and shortterm investments  consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2015  the weighted average remaining duration of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 79 days 

to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt we would incur additional interest expense  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2015  and significant endorsement contracts including related marketing commitments entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 

the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 438 million  excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2015  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2015  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2015  the company had letters of credit outstanding totaling 165 million  these letters of credit were issued primarily for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 



in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle at the reporting date any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist this accounting standard was effective for us beginning june 1 2014 and early adoption was permitted we early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in july 2012 the fasb issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary this accounting standard update was effective for us beginning june 1 2013 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments this new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements this new guidance was effective for us beginning june 1 2013 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 



in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in addition the new standard requires that reporting companies disclose the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers based on the fasbs decision in july 2015 to defer the effective date and to allow more flexibility with implementation we anticipate the new standard will be effective for us beginning june 1 2018 the new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application we have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 



our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale and online store revenues are recorded upon delivery to the customer 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the united states precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to operating overhead expense  in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales  if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales  

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense  relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year when we determine payments are probable the amounts are recorded in demand creation expense  ratably over the contract period based on our best estimate of the endorsers performance in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance increased or decreased demand creation expense  may be recorded in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percent of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales  as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense  uniformly over the guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the twostep impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

fair value measurements 

for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments including us treasury securities 

in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as time deposits commercial paper and bonds us agency securities and money market funds 

level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our availableforsale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include a comparison to another independent pricing vendor 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use derivative contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency and interest rate transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income  rather than net income  until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income  in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income  into net income  sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of these derivative contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income  to other income expense net  during the quarter in which the decrease occurs 

we have in the past used and may in the future use forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries the change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income  within total shareholders’ equity  to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as other income expense net  during the period in which changes occur 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

income taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense  in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states thus reducing our overall income tax expense  the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense  in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense  would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes  excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense  the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense  

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward and options contracts to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have in the past and may in the future also use forward or options contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting up to 12  to 24  months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100  of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs the majority of derivatives outstanding as of may 31 2015  are designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges primarily for eurous dollar british poundeuro and japanese yenus dollar currency pairs  see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans fixedrate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixedrate debt as well as payfixed receivevariable forwardstarting interest rate swaps for cash outflows of interest payments on future debt 



we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 117 million and 50 million at may 31 2015 and 2014 respectively the var increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio a longer weighted average duration on our outstanding trades and an increase in foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2015 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 205 million and 70 million during fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

during the year ended may 31 2015 we entered into a series of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements a forwardstarting interest rate swap is an agreement that effectively hedges the variability in future benchmark interest payments attributable to changes in interest rates on the forecasted issuance of fixedrate debt we entered into these forwardstarting interest rate swaps in order to lock in fixed interest rates on our forecasted issuance of debt these instruments were designated as cash flow hedges of the variability in the expected cash outflows of interest payments on future debt due to changes in benchmark interest rates 

details of thirdparty debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at may 31 2015 



1 forwardstarting interest rate swaps have been included in the maturities category based on when the related hedged forecasted debt issuance and corresponding swap terminations are expected to occur 

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income  upon consolidation of this subsidiary

our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and internet websites which we refer to as our “direct to consumer” or dtc operations and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees throughout the world virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors practically all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad 



  

we focus our nike brand product offerings in eight key categories running basketball football soccer men’s training women’s training action sports sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products and golf basketball includes our brand jordan product offerings and mens training includes our baseball and us football product offerings we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as cricket lacrosse tennis volleyball wrestling walking and outdoor activities 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on highquality construction and innovation in our products sportswear running basketball and football soccer are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales 

we sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos 

we sell a line of performance equipment under the nike brand name including bags socks sport balls eyewear timepieces digital devices bats gloves protective equipment golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary nike ihm inc

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 18 — operating segments and related information of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing riskwe report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment 

converse is also a reportable segment and operates in one industry the design marketing licensing and selling of casual sneakers apparel and accessories 



in fiscal 2014 nike brand and converse sales in the united states accounted for approximately 46 of total revenues compared to 45 in fiscal 2013 and 42 in fiscal 2012 we sell to thousands of retail accounts in the united states including a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal 2014 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 26 of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal 2014 86 of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding nike golf hurley and converse were made under the futures program compared to 87 in fiscal 2013 and 86 in fiscal 2012 in fiscal 2014 71 of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding nike golf hurley and converse were made under the futures program compared to 67 in fiscal 2013 and 64 in fiscal 2012 

we utilize nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf skateboarding and snowboarding in addition our direct to consumer operations sell nike brand products to consumers through our ecommerce website wwwnikecom  and through the following number of retail stores in the united states 



nike has five primary distribution centers in the united states located in memphis tennessee three of which are leased nike brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our foothill ranch california distribution center converse and hurley products are shipped primarily from ontario california 



in fiscal 2014 nonus nike brand and converse sales accounted for 54 of total revenues compared to 55 in fiscal 2013 and 58 in fiscal 2012 we sell our products to retail accounts through our own direct to consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives around the world we sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the united states in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures ordering program described above during fiscal 2014 nike’s three largest customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately 6 of total nonus sales 

our direct to consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the united states

no  customer accounted for 10  or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2014 



worldwide futures orders for nike brand excluding nike golf and hurley athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2014 were 133 billion compared to 121 billion for the same period last year this futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our converse hurley and nike golf businesses 



we believe our research design and development efforts are key factors in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

as we continue to develop new technologies nike is simultaneously focused on the design of innovative products incorporating such technologies throughout our product categories using market intelligence and research the various nike design teams identify opportunities to leverage new technologies in existing categories responding to consumer preferences the proliferation of nike air lunar shox free flywire drifit flyknit nike and nike fuel technologies through running basketball mens training womens training and sportswear among others typifies the companys dedication to designing innovative products 



we are supplied by approximately 150 footwear factories located in 14 countries the largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 5 of total fiscal 2014 nike brand footwear production virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories in fiscal 2014 contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 43 28 and 25 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries in fiscal 2014 five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2014 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 67 of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2014 

we are supplied by approximately 430 apparel factories located in 41 countries the largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 7 of total fiscal 2014 nike brand apparel production virtually all of our apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers who often operate multiple factories in fiscal 2014 most of this apparel production occurred in china vietnam thailand indonesia sri lanka pakistan and malaysia in fiscal 2014 one apparel contract manufacturer accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2014 apparel production and the top five contract manufacturers in aggregate accounted for approximately 34 of nike brand apparel production in fiscal 2014 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make nike airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2014 nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike inc with facilities near beaverton oregon and in st louis missouri as well as independent contractors in china and vietnam were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads both virgin and recycled specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place nikes independent contract manufacturers and suppliers have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying raw material requirements for the production of our products 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2014 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 8 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2015 



our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world   these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts such protectionist measures if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and we engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions in brazil we are actively monitoring for dumping investigations against products from china and other countries that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may increase customs clearance times for imports of footwear apparel and equipment moreover with respect to trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i   addresses legitimate and core concerns ii   is consistent with international trade rules and iii   reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as costeffective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 



the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas vf corp puma li ning and under armour among others we also compete with a number of vertical retailers such as lululemon athletica and uniqlo the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear apparel and equipment in the world important aspects of competition in this industry are 

 we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 



we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we own common law rights in the trade dress of several significant shoe designs and elements for certain trade dress we have sought and obtained federal trademark registrations 

nike has copyright protection in its design graphics and other original works when appropriate we have sought registrations for this content 

nike owns patents and has a patent license facilitating its use of “air” technologies the air process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air patents will not expire for several years 

we also file and maintain many us and foreign utility patents as well as many us and foreign design patents protecting components manufacturing techniques features and industrial design used in various athletic and leisure footwear apparel athletic equipment digital devices and golf products these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this calendar year in the united states will last until 2028 for design patents and until 2034 for utility patents 

we believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the united states and select foreign countries on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks and patents against infringement 



as of may 31 2014 we had approximately 56500 employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or by organizations similar to a union in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements nike has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products 

product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories or lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we rely on technical innovation and highquality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to enhance athletic performance reduce injury and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to develop evaluate and promote our products as well as establish product authenticity with consumers if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into costeffective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand sales and profitability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are manufactured and sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct purchase and sale transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates globally our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar adversely affects the us dollar value of the companys foreign currencydenominated sales and earnings currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar or other trading currency but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar or other trading currency our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

global economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

although the global economy has been showing signs of improvement its uncertain state continues to impact businesses around the world and most acutely in emerging markets and developing economies continuing uncertainty in the global capital and credit markets have led to fluctuations in the availability of business credit and capital liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures sustained unemployment at historically high levels and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world if global economic and financial market conditions do not improve or deteriorate the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of additional factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix and geographic sales trends all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations shipping timing returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our converse hurley and nike golf businesses 

our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins cash flows and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business when the retail economy weakens retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers that experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

our direct to consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our direct to consumer stores have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our direct to consumer operations a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation in addition extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our stores are located could adversely affect our business risks specific to our ecommerce business also include diversion of sales from our and our retailers brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our ecommerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike and swoosh design trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products and services 

we believe that our trademarks patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trade secret misappropriation or trademark copyright design patent utility patent or other intellectual property infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks copyrights trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent confidential information from unauthorized use andor disclosure such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure agreements and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation or a decline in our stock price or a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect our results operations or reputation 

hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate largescale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data misappropriation of our consumers’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention materially damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits 

in addition we must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal data any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal and reputational risks misuse of or failure to secure personal information could also result in violation of data privacy laws and regulations proceedings against the company by governmental entities or others damage to our reputation and credibility and could have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our intellectual property we require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees that make products using our intellectual property including indirectly their contract manufacturers to comply with a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries if our capital or financing needs in the united states require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the united states subject to significant change there have been proposals to reform us and foreign tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows 

our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes 

we and our subsidiaries are engaged in a number of intercompany transactions across multiple tax jurisdictions although we believe that these transactions reflect the accurate economic allocation of profit and that the proper transfer pricing documentation is in place the profit allocation and transfer pricing terms and conditions required to be arms length may be scrutinized by local tax authorities during an audit and any resulting changes may impact our mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates 

portions of our operations are subject to a reduced tax rate or are free of tax under various tax holidays and rulings that expire in whole or in part from time to time these tax holidays and rulings may be extended when certain conditions are met or terminated if certain conditions are not met if the tax holidays and rulings are not extended or if we fail to satisfy the conditions of the reduced tax rate then our effective tax rate would increase in the future 

we are also subject to the examination of our tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on a concentrated source base of contract manufacturers to supply a significant portion of our footwear products 

nike is supplied by approximately 150 footwear factories located in 14 countries we do not own or operate any of our own manufacturing facilities and depend upon independent contract manufacturers to manufacture all of the products we sell in fiscal 2014 five footwear contract manufacturers each accounted for greater than 10 of fiscal 2014 footwear production and in aggregate accounted for approximately 67 of nike brand footwear production in fiscal 2014 our ability to meet our customers needs depends on our ability to maintain a steady supply of products from our independent contract manufacturers if one or more of our significant suppliers were to sever their relationship with us or significantly alter the terms of our relationship we may not be able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner which could have a material adverse effect on our sales financial condition or results of operations additionally if any of our primary contract manufacturers fail to make timely shipments do not meet our quality standards or otherwise fail to deliver us product in accordance with our plans there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads specialized performance fabrics designed to efficiently wick moisture away from the body retain heat or repel rain andor snow as well as plastic and metal hardware — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train and employ adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption our contract manufacturers might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further our unaffiliated contract manufacturers have experienced and may continue to experience in the future unexpected increases in work wages whether government mandated or otherwise in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for the company during fiscal 2014 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in certain nike markets including argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa and thailand collectively the sojitz markets excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in the sojitz markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy or interruption of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty hosted services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing the failure of these systems to operate effectively or problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown 

and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce and the marketing and use of our digital sport products we also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores which could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions and natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our retail stores suppliers customers and vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition moreover natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes and tsunamis whether occurring in the united states or abroad and their related consequences and effects including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe costeffective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in developing a new business or expanding an existing business the failure of any significant investment to provide expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

as of june 30 2014 philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owned more than 751 of our class a common stock if on june 30 2014 all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would have owned more than 162 of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new initiatives 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some 

shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts as well as through nikeowned inline and factory retail stores and nikeowned internet websites which we refer to as our “direct to consumer” or dtc operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 

in addition to achieving longterm sustainable revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

  delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer pricetovalue proposition 

  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency product design and innovation and 

  making our supply chain a competitive advantage 

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals continue to be 

 over the past ten years we have achieved many of these financial goals during this time revenues and diluted earnings per common share for nike inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 9 and 13 respectively on an annual compounded basis our return on invested capital has increased from 22 to 25 and we expanded gross margins by approximately 190 basis points 

on november 15 2012 we announced a twoforone stock split of both class a and class b common shares the stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on december 24 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business december 10 2012 common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on december 26 2012 all share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split 

our fiscal 2014 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the nike inc portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues earnings and cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth despite significant foreign currency headwinds we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2014 our revenues grew 10 to 278 billion net income from continuing operations increased 10 to 27 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per common share of 297 an 11 increase from fiscal 2013 

earnings before interest and income taxes ebit from continuing operations increased 10 for fiscal 2014 driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense the increase in revenues was driven by growth across nearly all nike   brand geographies key categories and product types this growth was primarily fueled by 

 we also delivered strong results for converse with revenue and ebit growth of 16 and 17 respectively 

our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices and contribution from our higher margin dtc business partially offset by higher product input costs due primarily to labor cost inflation in our product costs and foreign currency headwinds 

for fiscal 2014 the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate in addition diluted earnings per common share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 1 decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of certain assets of the umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of 107 million net of tax during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of cole haan and recorded a gain on sale of 231 million net of tax as of may 31 2013 the company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses unless otherwise indicated the following disclosures reflect the companys continuing operations refer to our “discontinued operations section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations

  unless otherwise indicated the following disclosures reflect the company’s continuing operations 



 



revenues 



 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

on a currency neutral basis revenues from nike inc continuing operations grew 11 for fiscal 2014 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and converse every nike brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2014 north america contributed 5 percentage points of the increase in nike inc revenues while western europe and emerging markets each contributed 2 percentage points and central  eastern europe and converse each contributed 1 percentage point 

on a currency neutral basis nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 12 and 10 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 4 during fiscal 2014 the increase in nike brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2014 was mainly due to growth in our basketball sportswear running and football soccer categories the growth of nike footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products including nike and brand jordan basketball styles running models with nike free air max lunar and flyknit technologies and performance football soccer products footwear unit sales in fiscal 2014 increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 5 driven nearly equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products 

for nike brand apparel the increase in revenues for fiscal 2014 was driven by growth in all key categories most notably our football soccer running and womens training categories in fiscal 2014 unit sales of apparel increased approximately 6 and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 4 driven by price increases and to a lesser extent a shift in mix to higher priced products 

while wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall nike brand revenues we continue to expand our dtc businesses in each of our geographies our nike brand dtc operations include nikeowned inline and factory stores as well as online sales through nikeowned websites for fiscal 2014 dtc revenues represented approximately 20 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 18 in fiscal 2013 on a currency neutral basis dtc revenues grew 22 for fiscal 2014 as comparable store sales grew 10 and we continued to open new stores and expand our ecommerce business comparable store sales include revenues from nikeowned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met 1 the store has been open at least one year 2 square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and 3 the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year online sales through nikeowned websites which are not included in comparable store sales grew 42 in fiscal 2014 online sales represented approximately 15 of our total nike brand dtc revenues for fiscal 2014 compared to 12 for fiscal 2013 

on a wholesale equivalent basis and excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates fiscal 2014 nike brand mens revenues increased 9 mainly as a result of strong growth in our basketball football soccer running and sportswear categories womens revenues increased 12 in large part due to increases in our running sportswear and womens training categories the 16 increase in the young athletes business was driven by increases in the basketball and football soccer categories in part due to our expanded footwear and apparel offerings for this age group 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

on a currency neutral basis revenues from our nike inc continuing operations grew 11 for fiscal 2013 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and converse every nike brand geography except greater china delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013 north america contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in nike inc revenues while emerging markets contributed 2 percentage points and western and central  eastern europe each contributed 1 percentage point greater china  s results reduced nike inc revenue growth by 1 percentage point revenues for converse contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates nike brand footwear and apparel revenues increased 11 and 10 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 17 during fiscal 2013 the increase in nike brand footwear revenues for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our running basketball football soccer and sportswear categories the growth of nike footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products including running models with nike free and lunar technologies nike and brand jordan basketball styles and performance football soccer products in fiscal 2013 unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4 driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products 

for nike brand apparel the increase in revenues for fiscal 2013 was driven by our men  s training category which includes the nfl licensed business in addition to strong demand for running and basketball products apparel unit sales in fiscal 2013 increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per unit increased approximately 3 reflecting a favorable mix of higher priced products such as performance running basketball and nfl licensed apparel and to a lesser extent higher selling prices  

for fiscal 2013 dtc channels represented approximately 18 of overall nike brand revenues compared to 16 in fiscal 2012 on a currency neutral basis dtc revenues grew 24 for fiscal 2013 as comparable store sales grew 14 and we continued to expand our store network and ecommerce businesses online sales through nikeowned websites grew 32 in fiscal 2013 and represented approximately 12 of our total nike brand dtc revenues for fiscal 2013 

on a wholesale equivalent and currency neutral basis fiscal 2013 nike brand mens revenues increased 9 due primarily to growth in our running mens training and basketball categories womens revenues increased 9 driven primarily by an increase in running and womens training the 11 increase in the young athletes business was due primarily to increases in basketball 

futures orders 

futures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2014 were 11 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period the us   dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period   excluding the impact of currency changes futures orders increased 12 with unit orders and average selling price per unit contributing approximately 8 and 4 percentage points of growth respectively 

by geography futures orders growth was as follows   



 the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing changes in the mix of orders between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations discounts and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including sales of atonce and closeout nike brand footwear and apparel nike brand equipment dtc operation sales and sales from converse nike golf and hurley 

gross margin 



fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

for fiscal 2014 our consolidated gross margin was 120 basis points higher than fiscal 2013 primarily driven by higher nike brand average selling prices increasing gross margin approximately 160 basis points attributable to both price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products gross margin was also positively impacted by growth in our higher margin dtc business increasing gross margin approximately 40 basis points and improved margins due to cleaner closeout inventories increasing margin approximately 20 basis points these increases in gross margin were partially offset by higher product costs decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points primarily due to a shift in mix to higher cost products as well as product labor input cost inflation gross margins were also negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements decreasing gross margin approximately 50 basis points 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

for fiscal 2013 our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012 primarily driven by higher average selling prices approximately 160 basis points that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix the positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs approximately 110 basis points primarily due to higher factory labor costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements approximately 40 basis points 

in addition in fiscal 2013 we experienced significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business while growth in these lower gross margin segments delivered incremental revenue and profits it had a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin 

total selling and administrative expense 



 fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

demand creation expense increased 10 compared to the prior year mainly driven by marketing support for events including the world cup higher sports marketing expense key product launches and initiatives and investments to upgrade the presentation of our products in wholesale accounts for fiscal 2014 changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on demand creation expense 

compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 14 primarily attributable to growth in our dtc business driven by new store openings higher personnel costs and ecommerce launches as well as increased investments in our digital capabilities and corporate infrastructure changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on operating overhead expense for fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

demand creation expense increased 5 compared to the prior year mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense marketing support for key product initiatives including the nike fuelband and nfl launch as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the european football championships and london summer olympics excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates demand creation expense increased 8 

compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 13 primarily attributable to increased investments in our dtc operations higher personnel costs and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the growth in operating overhead expense was 15 

other expense income net 



other expense income net comprises foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

other expense income net shifted from 15 million of other income net for fiscal 2013 to 103 million of other expense net for fiscal 2014 primarily driven by a 90 million adverse change in foreign currency conversion gains and losses as well as an adverse legal judgment in the second quarter of the current year related to a long outstanding bankruptcy case for a former customer in western europe 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of 139 million for fiscal 2014 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

other expense income net shifted from 54 million of other expense net for fiscal 2012 to 15 million of other income net for fiscal 2013 this change was primarily driven by a 48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses as well as the recognition of a 24 million restructuring charge for nike brand  s western europe operations in fiscal 2012 these positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from nonoperating items 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of 56 million for fiscal 2013 

income taxes 



fiscal 2014 compared to fiscal 2013   

the 70 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by an increase in earnings in lower tax jurisdictions during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended may 31 2014 we reached a resolution with the irs on an advanced pricing agreement this agreement did not have a material impact on our effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 refer to note 9 — income taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

the 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the us legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar decreases the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 

for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other expense income net  refer to note 17 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike’s us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost purchase exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense income net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 17 – risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to other comprehensive income within the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a detriment of approximately 288 million and 605 million for the years ended may 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a detriment of approximately 49 million and 104 million for the years ended may 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 17 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 139 million and 56 million on our income before income taxes for the years ended may 31 2014 and 2013 respectively 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income net  the impact of ineffective hedges was immaterial for any period presented to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in other comprehensive income there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2014 and 2013 there were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended may 31 2014 and 2013 



cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 3003 million  for fiscal 2014  compared to 2968 million  for fiscal 2013  our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2014  was net income of 2693 million  our fiscal 2014  change in working capital was a net cash outflow  of 488 million  as compared to a net cash outflow  of 78 million  for fiscal 2013  our investments in working capital increased due to higher inventory levels to support higher reported futures orders growth in accounts receivable reflecting the increase in sales and higher prepaid marketing expenses in advance of the world cup these increases in working capital were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 

cash used by investing activities was 1207 million  during fiscal 2014  compared to a 940 million  use of cash for fiscal 2013  a major driver of the change was a 282 million increase in additions to property plant and equipment from 598 million in fiscal 2013 to 880 million in fiscal 2014 reflective of investments in infrastructure to support current and future growth as well as digital capabilities in fiscal 2014 we made 328 million in net purchases of shortterm investments net of salesmaturities compared to 1140 million  in net purchases net of salesmaturities in fiscal 2013 cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2013 was partially offset by 786 million in proceeds from the sale of umbro and cole haan 

cash used by financing activities was 2914 million  for fiscal 2014  compared to 1045 million  for fiscal 2013  an increase of 1869 million the increase was primarily due to a 954 million increase in share repurchases to 2628 million a  986 million  decrease in net proceeds from long term debt issuance reflecting the issuance of 10 and 30year notes in april 2013 and a 96 million increase in dividends partially offset by a yearonyear increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2014  we purchased 366 million  shares of nike’s class b common stock for 2628 million  an average price of  7180  during fiscal 2013 we completed the fouryear 5 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in september 2008 under that program we purchased a total of 1188 million shares at an average price of 4208 subsequently we began repurchases under a fouryear 8 billion program approved by the board in september 2012 as of the end of fiscal 2014  we had repurchased 519 million  shares at an average price of 6583  for a total cost of 3417 million  under this current program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on april 23 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities the shelf expires on april 23 2016 on april 23 2013 we issued 10 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 225 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2023 the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3625 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2043 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of 998 million 

on november 1 2011 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to 15 billion with lender approval following an extension agreement on september 17 2013 between the company and the syndicate of banks the facility matures november 1 2017 with a oneyear extension option exercisable through october 31 2014 no  amounts were outstanding under this facility as of may 31 2014  or 2013  

we currently have longterm debt ratings of aa and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2014  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program during the year ended may 31 2014  we did not issue commercial paper and as of may 31 2014  there were no outstanding borrowings under this program we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2015 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

as of may 31 2014  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 51 billion  of which 25 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2014  the average duration of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents portfolio was 126 days 

to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the united states we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the united states through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits if we elect to raise capital in the united states through debt we would incur additional interest expense  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnification relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnification is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2014  and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 

the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 506 million  excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2014  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2014  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2014  letters of credit of 135 million  were outstanding which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 



in july 2013 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update intended to provide guidance on the presentation of unrecognized tax benefits reflecting the manner in which an entity would settle at the reporting date any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position when net operating loss carryforwards similar tax losses or tax credit carryforwards exist this accounting standard is effective for us beginning june 1 2014 and early adoption is permitted we early adopted this guidance and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in july 2012 the fasb issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary this accounting standard update was effective for us beginning june 1 2013 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments this new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements this new guidance was effective for us beginning june 1 2013 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures the adoption had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 



in may 2014 the fasb issued an accounting standards update that replaces existing revenue recognition guidance among other things the updated guidance requires companies to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services the new guidance is effective for the company beginning june 1 2017 we are currently evaluating the effect the guidance will have on the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations 



our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the united states precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to operating overhead expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales   

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record demand creation expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

certain contracts provide for variable payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in demand creation expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s performance increased or decreased demand creation expense may be reported in a future period 

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contracts for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in demand creation expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets   

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the twostep impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

fair value measurements 

for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments including us treasury securities 

in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds us agency securities and money market funds 

level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our availableforsale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include an analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income sometime after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the notional value of forward and option contracts should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense income net  during the quarter in which the decrease occurs 

we have used and may in the future use forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries the change in fair value of the forward contracts or options hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within total shareholders’ equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported as other expense income net  during the period in which changes occur 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

income taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate income before income taxes excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate income tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we evaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense income net  during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have and may in the future also use forward contracts or options to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions typically the company may enter into hedge contracts starting 12  to 24  months in advance of the forecasted transaction and may place incremental hedges up to 100  of the exposure by the time the forecasted transaction occurs hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros british pounds and japanese yen see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt 



we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 50 million and 34 million at may 31 2014 and 2013 respectively the var increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at may 31 2014 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 70 million and 49 million during fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at may 31 2014 



the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon consolidation of this subsidiary

we focus our nike brand and brand jordan product offerings in seven key categories running basketball football soccer men’s training women’s training nike sportswear our sportsinspired lifestyle products and action sports we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as baseball cricket golf lacrosse outdoor activities football tennis volleyball walking and wrestling 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in our products nike sportswear running basketball football soccer and kids’ shoes are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future 

we sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the abovementioned categories which feature the same trademarks and are sold predominantly through the same marketing and distribution channels as athletic footwear we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 18 — operating segments and related information of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through extensive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services our reportable operating 

segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment 



in fiscal 2013 sales in the united states including us sales of our other businesses accounted for approximately 45 of total revenues compared to 42 in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 converse and hurley our affiliate brands and nike golf comprise our other businesses we sell to thousands of retail accounts in the united states including a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal 2013 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25 of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal 2013 87 of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 86 in fiscal 2012 and 87 in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2013 67 of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 64 in fiscal 2012 and 60 in fiscal 2011 

we utilize nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf skateboarding and snowboarding in addition our direct to consumer operations sell nike brand products to consumers through our internet website wwwnikecom  and through the following number of retail stores in the united states 



nike has five primary distribution centers in the united states located in memphis tennessee three of which are leased nike brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our foothill ranch california distribution center converse and hurley products are shipped primarily from ontario california 



in fiscal 2013 nonus sales including nonus sales of our other businesses accounted for 55 of total revenues compared to 58 in both fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 we sell our products to retail accounts through our own direct to consumer operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives around the world we sell to thousands of retail accounts and operate 16 distribution centers outside of the united states in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures ordering program described above during fiscal 2013 nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 6 of total nonus sales 

our direct to consumer business operates the following number of retail stores outside the united states 



international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina australia austria belgium bermuda brazil canada chile china costa rica croatia cyprus the czech republic denmark finland france germany greece hong kong hungary india indonesia ireland israel italy japan korea malaysia mexico new zealand the netherlands norway the philippines poland portugal russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sri lanka sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united arab emirates the united kingdom uruguay and vietnam 



no customer accounted for 10 or more of our worldwide net sales during fiscal 2013 



worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2013 were 121 billion compared to 112 billion for the same period last year this futures orders amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of discounts order cancellations and returns can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 



we believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design sustainability and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 



virtually all of our footwear is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers in fiscal 2013 contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 42 30 and 26 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries the largest single footwear factory with which we have contracted accounted for approximately 6 of total fiscal 2013 nike brand footwear production almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 28 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china vietnam thailand indonesia sri lanka pakistan malaysia turkey mexico and cambodia the largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6 of total fiscal 2013 apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2013 nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike inc with facilities in beaverton oregon and st louis missouri as well as independent contractors in china and vietnam were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain and snow retain heat or efficiently wick moisture away from the body nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2013 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 13 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those markets such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2014 



our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such material effects occurring in the future 

in recent years uncertain global and regional economic conditions have affected international trade and caused a rise in protectionist actions around the world   these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts such protectionist measures if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

we monitor protectionist trends and developments throughout the world that may materially impact our industry and engage in administrative and judicial processes to mitigate trade restrictions in brazil we are actively monitoring for dumping investigations against products from china and other countries that may result in additional antidumping measures and could affect our industry we are also monitoring for and advocating against other impediments that may increase customs clearance times for imports of footwear apparel and equipment moreover with respect to trade restrictions targeting china which represents an important sourcing and consumer marketing country for us we are working with a broad coalition of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i   addresses legitimate and core concerns ii   is consistent with international trade rules and iii   reflects and considers chinas domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community 

where trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature although alternate sources of supply might not be as cost effective and could have an ongoing adverse impact on profitability 



the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment including adidas vf corp puma li ning and under armour among others we also compete with a number of vertical retailers such as lululemon and uniqlo the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear apparel and equipment in the world important aspects of competition in this industry are 

 

we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 



we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike® and swoosh design® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air® patents will not expire for several years 

we also file and maintain many us and foreign utility patents as well as many us and foreign design patents covering components manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure footwear apparel athletic equipment digital devices and golf products these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year in the us will last until 2027 for design patents and until 2033 for utility patents 

we believe our success depends primarily upon our capabilities in design research and development production and marketing rather than exclusively upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing patent applications for the united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 



as of may 31 2013 we had approximately 48000 employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require employee representation by works councils which may be entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or by organizations similar to a union in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industrywide or national collective bargaining agreements nike has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is highly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure footwear companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure footwear apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns product innovation and product quality our commitment to product innovation and quality and our continuing investment in design including materials and marketing may not have the desired impact on our brand image and reputation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine consumer confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking websites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner however long lead times for many of our products may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or consumer preferences all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance products or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumers if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues or negative posts or comments about our sports marketing endorsements on social networking websites could also seriously harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

global capital and credit market conditions and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to fluctuations in the availability of business credit and capital liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures higher unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

futures orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our futures ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations shipping timing returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

our futures ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program these advance orders may be canceled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business when the retail economy weakens retailers may be more cautious with orders a slowing economy in our key markets could adversely affect the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

our direct to consumer operations have required and will continue to require a substantial investment and commitment of resources and are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 

our direct to consumer locations have required substantial fixed investment in equipment and leasehold improvements information systems inventory and personnel we have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space certain stores have been designed and built to serve as highprofile venues to promote brand awareness and marketing activities because of their unique design elements locations and size these stores require substantially more investment than certain of our other stores due to the high fixedcost structure associated with our direct to consumer operations a decline in sales or the closure or poor performance of individual or multiple stores could result in significant lease termination costs writeoffs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employeerelated costs 

many factors unique to retail operations some of which are beyond the company’s control pose risks and uncertainties risks include but are not limited to credit card fraud mismanagement of existing retail channel partners and inability to manage costs associated with store construction and operation risks specific to our ecommerce business also include diversion of sales from our brick and mortar stores difficulty in recreating 

the instore experience through direct channels and liability for online content our failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in our ecommerce business as well as damage our reputation and brands 

failure to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike® and swoosh design® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 170 jurisdictions in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize on or in the marketing of our products 

we believe that our trademarks patents trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trade secret misappropriation or trademark copyright design patent utility patent or other intellectual property infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks copyrights trade secrets patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe on their trademarks copyrights patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development use importation andor sale of certain products 

we take various actions to prevent confidential information from unauthorized use andor disclosure such actions include contractual measures such as entering into nondisclosure agreements and providing confidential information awareness training our controls and efforts to prevent unauthorized use andor disclosure of confidential information might not always be effective confidential information that is related to business strategy new technologies mergers and acquisitions unpublished financial results or personal data could be prematurely or inadvertently used andor disclosed resulting in a loss of reputation a decline in our stock price a negative impact on our market position and could lead to damages fines penalties or injunctions 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect or allow enforcement of intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of products using our trademarks we impose and require the contractors that directly manufacture our products and our licensees the contract with manufacturers to make products bearing our trademarks a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety notwithstanding their contractual obligations from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may fail to enforce such standards or applicable local law on their contractors significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions increases in income tax rates could reduce our aftertax income from affected jurisdictions we earn a substantial portion of our income in foreign countries if our capital or financing needs in the united states require us to repatriate earnings from foreign jurisdictions above our current levels our effective income tax rates for the affected periods could be negatively impacted current economic and political conditions make tax rules in any jurisdiction including the united states subject to 

significant change there have been proposals to reform us tax laws that could significantly impact how us multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings although we cannot predict whether or in what form these proposals will pass several of the proposals being considered if enacted into law could have an adverse impact on our income tax expense and cash flows 

our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes the company is also subject to the examination of its tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits or related disputes could have an adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we may hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

if one or more of our counterparty financial institutions default on their obligations to us or fail we may incur significant losses 

as part of our hedging activities we enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments which may include forward contracts commodity futures contracts option contracts collars and swaps with various financial institutions in addition we have significant amounts of cash cash equivalents and other investments on deposit or in accounts with banks or other financial institutions in the united states and abroad as a result we are exposed to the risk of default by or failure of counterparty financial institutions the risk of counterparty default or failure may be heightened during economic downturns and periods of uncertainty in the financial markets if one of our counterparties were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy our ability to recover losses incurred as a result of default or our assets that are deposited or held in accounts with such counterparty may be limited by the counterparty’s liquidity or the applicable laws governing the insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings in the event of default or failure of one or more of our counterparties we could incur significant losses which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain or snow retain heat or efficiently wick moisture away from the body — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers both our apparel and footwear products are dependent upon the ability of our unaffiliated contract manufacturers to locate train and employ adequate personnel nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk and are subject to wage rates that are oftentimes regulated by the governments of the countries in which our products are manufactured 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all further there may be wage increases whether government mandated or otherwise that affect our unaffiliated contract manufacturers in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in labor or wages or the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as air freight which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of oil is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in canceled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies and growth particularly in emerging markets depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse effect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty hosted services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes retail operations and other business activities our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over a number of years we have implemented information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate our work to integrate and enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations is ongoing the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage 

in addition hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data our customers’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits in addition we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks 

furthermore we depend on information technology systems and personal data collection and use for digital marketing digital commerce and the marketing and use of our digital sport products we also engage in electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties including customers suppliers vendors and consumers our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes and may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown misuse or leakage of personal information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

the market for prime real estate is competitive 

our ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new retail stores and otherwise conduct our operations both domestically and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic square footage cotenancies lease economics demographics and other factors we also must be able to effectively renew our existing real estate leases in addition from time to time we seek to downsize consolidate reposition or close some of our real estate locations which may require modification of an existing lease failure to secure adequate new locations or successfully modify leases for existing locations or failure to effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of retail stores could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

additionally the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties domestically and internationally this could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options at previously negotiated rents and the quality of our decisions to renew expiring leases at negotiated rents any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 

natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the us or abroad and the consequences and effects thereof including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business the failure of any significant investment to provide their expected returns or profitability could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm our business our future success also depends on our ability to recruit retain and motivate our personnel sufficiently both to maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 756 of our class a common stock if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 158 of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

changes in our credit ratings or macroeconomic conditions may affect our liquidity increasing borrowing costs and limiting our financing options 

our longterm debt is currently rated investment grade by standard  poor’s and moody’s investors service if our credit ratings are lowered borrowing costs for future longterm debt or shortterm credit facilities may increase and our financing options including our access to the unsecured credit market could be limited we may also be subject to restrictive covenants that would reduce our flexibility in addition macroeconomic conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to refinance existing debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new initiatives 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threequarters of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet market expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as analysts’ estimates of our future performance analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

nike designs develops markets and sells athletic footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and internet websites which we refer to as our “direct to consumer” operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives in virtually all countries around the world our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment accessories and service businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 

in addition to achieving longterm sustainable revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

   making our supply chain a competitive advantage 

  reducing product costs through a continued focus on manufacturing efficiency product design and innovation and 

 delivering innovative premium products that command higher prices while maintaining a strong consumer pricetovalue proposition 

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals continue to be 

 over the past ten years we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals during this time revenues and earnings per share for nike inc inclusive of both continuing and discontinued operations have grown 9 and 15 respectively on an annual compounded basis our return on invested capital has increased from 18 to 24 and we expanded gross margins by approximately 260 basis points 

on november 15 2012 we announced a twoforone stock split of both class a and class b common shares the stock split was in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on december 24 2012 to shareholders of record at the close of business december 10 2012 common stock began trading at the splitadjusted price on december 26 2012 all share numbers and per share amounts presented reflect the stock split 

our fiscal 2013 results from continuing operations demonstrated the power of the nike inc portfolio to deliver consistent growth in revenues earnings and cash returns to shareholders while investing for longterm growth despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2013 our revenues grew 8 to 253 billion net income from continuing operations increased 9 to 25 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 269 an 11 increase from fiscal 2012 

earnings before interest and income taxes for continuing operations increased 8 for fiscal 2013 driven by revenue growth and improved gross margin which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue the increase in revenues was driven by growth across most nike   brand geographies key categories and product types this growth was primarily fueled by 

 revenues also improved for each of our other businesses converse nike golf and hurley 

our gross margins improved largely due to the positive impact of higher average selling prices partially offset by higher product input costs primarily labor cost inflation and foreign currency headwinds 

for fiscal 2013 the growth of our net income from continuing operations was positively affected by a yearoveryear decrease in our effective tax rate in addition diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2 decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding as a result of share repurchases during fiscal 2013 

on may 31 2012 we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses which would allow us to better focus our resources on driving growth in the nike jordan converse and hurley brands during the second quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of certain assets of the umbro brand and recorded a loss on the sale of these assets of 107 million net of tax during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we completed the sale of cole haan and recorded a gain on sale of 231 million net of tax as of may 31 2013 the company had substantially completed all transition services related to the sale of both businesses unless otherwise indicated the following disclosures reflect the companys continuing operations refer to our “discontinued operations section for additional information regarding our discontinued operations 

while we expect to face continued macroeconomic uncertainties in the global economy we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above 



  unless otherwise indicated the following disclosures reflect the company’s continuing operations 





revenues 



 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

on a currency neutral basis revenues from our nike inc continuing operations grew 11 for fiscal 2013 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and our other businesses every nike brand geography except greater china delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2013 north america contributed 7 percentage points of the increase in nike inc revenues while emerging markets contributed 2 percentage points and western and central and eastern europe each contributed 1 percentage point greater china  s results reduced nike inc revenue growth by 1 percentage point revenues for our other businesses contributed 1 percentage point to our consolidated revenue growth 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates nike brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11 and 10 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 20 during fiscal 2013 the increase in nike brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2013 was attributable to growth across our running basketball football soccer and sportswear categories the growth of nike footwear revenues continued to be fueled by increased demand for performance products including running models with nike free and lunar technologies nike and brand jordan basketball styles and performance football soccer products in fiscal 2013 unit sales of footwear increased approximately 7 and the average selling price per pair increased approximately 4 driven equally by price increases and a shift in mix to higher priced products

on a currency neutral basis revenues for nike incs continuing operations grew 15 for fiscal 2012 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and our other businesses excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates revenues for the nike brand increased 15 as every nike brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012 north america contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the nike brand revenue increase while the emerging markets and greater china geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the nike brand revenue growth respectively revenues for our other businesses grew 12 during fiscal 2012 contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates nike brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15 and 13 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 16 during fiscal 2012 continuing to fuel the growth of our nike brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products including the nike lunar and free technologies the increase in nike brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to doubledigit percentage growth in unit sales along with a lowsingledigit percentage increase in average selling price per pair primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases partially offset by higher discounts on closeout sales the overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories notably running sportswear and basketball for nike brand apparel the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by midsingledigit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices the increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases partially offset by a higher mix of closeout sales the overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories 

for fiscal 2012 direct to consumer channels represented approximately 17 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 16 in fiscal 2011 on a currency neutral basis direct to consumer revenues grew 21 for fiscal 2012 as comparable store sales grew 13 and we continue to expand our store network and ecommerce business 

revenues for our other businesses consisted of results from our affiliate brands converse hurley and nike golf excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for these businesses increased by 12 in fiscal 2012 reflecting growth across all businesses except hurley which was down slightly for the fiscal year 

futures orders 

futures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2013 were 8 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period the us   dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period   excluding the impact of currency changes futures orders also increased 8 as unit orders contributed approximately 5 percentage points of growth and average selling price per unit contributed approximately 3 percentage points of growth 

by geography futures orders growth was as follows   



 

the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

  

gross margin 



fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

for fiscal 2013 our consolidated gross margin was 10 basis points higher than fiscal 2012 primarily driven by higher net average selling prices approximately 160 basis points that were attributable to higher prices and a favorable sales mix the positive benefit of higher net average selling prices was largely offset by higher product costs approximately 110 basis points primarily due to higher factory labor costs and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements approximately 40 basis points 

in addition we have seen significant shifts in the mix of revenues from higher to lower margin segments of our business while growth in these lower gross margin segments delivers incremental revenue and profits it has a negative effect on our consolidated gross margin 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011   

for fiscal 2012 our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period primarily driven by higher product input costs including materials and labor across most businesses also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges discounts on closeout sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure together these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases lower air freight costs the growth of our nike brand direct to consumer business and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives 

  

selling and administrative expense 



 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

demand creation expense increased 5 compared to the prior year mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense marketing support for key product initiatives including the nike fuelband and nfl launch as well as an increased level of marketing spending around global sporting events such as the european football championships and london summer olympics excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates demand creation expense increased 8 

compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 13 primarily attributable to increased investments in our direct to consumer operations higher personnel costs and corporate initiatives to support the growth of our overall business excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the growth in operating overhead expense was 15 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011   

overall selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012 

demand creation expense increased 11 compared to the prior year mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense marketing support for key product initiatives including the nike fuelband and nfl launch as well as an increased level of brand event spending in advance of the european football championships and london summer olympics for fiscal 2012 changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point 

compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 11 primarily attributable to increased investments in our direct to consumer operations higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business for fiscal 2012 changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point 

  

other income expense net 



other income expense net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

for fiscal 2013 other income net increased 69 million compared to the prior year this change was primarily driven by a 48 million decrease in foreign currency net losses in the current year as well as the recognition of a 24 million restructuring charge for nike brand  s western europe operations in the prior year these positive impacts were partially offset by smaller net gains from nonoperating items 

we estimate the combination of the translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net had an unfavorable impact on our income before income taxes of 56 million for fiscal 2013 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011   

for fiscal 2012 other expense net increased 79 million compared to the prior year this change was primarily driven by a 77 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year these impacts together with a 24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of nike brand  s western europe operations were partially offset by certain net gains related to nonoperating items 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 

  

income taxes 



  

fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012   

the 30 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate for the fiscal year was primarily driven by the us legislative retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit and a reduction of tax reserves on foreign operations partially offset by an increase in the percentage of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011   

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 90 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions this impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the united states as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings 

discontinued operations 

the company continually evaluates its existing portfolio of businesses to ensure resources are invested in those businesses that are accretive to the nike brand and represent the largest growth potential and highest returns on may 31 2012 the company announced its intention to divest of umbro and cole haan allowing it to focus its resources on driving growth in the nike jordan converse and hurley brands 

on february 1 2013 the company completed the sale of cole haan to apax partners for an agreed upon purchase price of 570 million and received at closing 561 million net of 9 million of purchase price adjustments the transaction resulted in a gain on sale of 231 million net of 137 million in tax expense this gain is included in the net income loss from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income 

beginning november 30 2012 we classified the cole haan disposal group as heldforsale and presented the results of cole haan’s operations in the net income loss from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income from this date until the sale the assets and liabilities of cole haan were recorded as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets of nike inc previously these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as “other businesses” 

under the sale agreement we agreed to provide certain transition services to cole haan for an expected period of 3 to 9 months from the date of sale we will also license nike proprietary air and lunar technologies to cole haan for a transition period the continuing cash flows related to these items are not expected to be significant to cole haan and we will have no significant continuing involvement with cole haan beyond the transition services additionally preexisting guarantees of certain cole haan lease payments remain in place after the sale the maximum exposure under the guarantees is 44 million at may 31 2013 the fair value of these guarantees is not material 

on november 30 2012 we completed the sale of certain assets of umbro to iconix brand group “iconix” for 225 million the results of umbro’s operations and umbro’s financial position are presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and balance sheets respectively previously these amounts were reported in our segment presentation as “other businesses” upon meeting the heldforsale criteria we recorded a loss of 107 million net of tax on the sale of umbro the loss on sale was calculated as the net sales price less the umbro assets of 248 million including intangibles goodwill and fixed assets other miscellaneous charges of 22 million and the release of the associated cumulative translation adjustment of 129 million offset by a 67 million tax benefit on the loss 

under the sale agreement we provided transition services to iconix while certain markets were transitioned to iconixdesignated licensees these transition services are substantially complete and we have wound down the remaining operations of umbro 

for the year ended may 31 2013  net income loss from discontinued operations included for both businesses the net gain or loss on sale net operating losses tax expenses and approximately  20 million  in wind down costs

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical and material by hedging a portion of the remaining exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of the nike trading company ntc and our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes 

on the underlying net exposures being hedged where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 

transactional exposures 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 in both purchasing scenarios a weaker us dollar reduces the inventory cost incurred by nike whereas a stronger us dollar increases its cost 

 for the currency within the factory currency exposure indices that is the local or functional currency of the factory the currency rate fluctuation affecting the product cost is recorded within inventories and is recognized in cost of sales when the related product is sold to a thirdparty all currencies within the indices excluding the us dollar and the local or functional currency of the factory are recognized as embedded derivative contracts and are recorded at fair value through other income expense net  refer to note 17 — risk management and derivatives for additional detail 

as an offset to the impacts of the fluctuating us dollar on our nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases described above a strengthening us dollar against the foreign currencies within the factory currency exposure indices decreases nike’s us dollar inventory cost conversely a weakening us dollar against the indexed foreign currencies increases our inventory cost 

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above generally these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product cost exposures as discussed below 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other income expense net  and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 17 – risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit detriment of approximately 605 million and 268 million for the years ended may 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate 

fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit detriment of approximately 104 million and 74 million for the years ended may 31 2013 and 2012 respectively 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 17 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded as well as the fair value of outstanding derivatives at period end 

we estimate the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net  had an unfavorable impact of approximately 56 million on our income before income taxes for the year ended may 31 2013 and had an insignificant impact for the year ended may 31 2012 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we have hedged and may in the future hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net  the impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2013 and 2012 cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled 22 million for the year ended may 31 2012 



cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 30 billion  for fiscal 2013  compared to 19 billion  for fiscal 2012  our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2013  was net income of 25 billion  our fiscal 2013 change in working capital was a net cash outflow  of 42 million  which is exclusive of working capital amounts sold as part of the divestitures of umbro and cole haan as compared to a net cash outflow  of 799 million  for fiscal 2012  our investments in working capital decreased due to slowing growth in inventory and reductions in accounts receivable compared to the prior year during fiscal 2013  inventory for continuing operations increased 7 compared to a 23 increase for fiscal 2012  the slowing growth was driven by our continued focus on increasing inventory productivity the reduction in accounts receivable was primarily driven by the collection of receivables related to discontinued operations 

cash used by investing activities was 1067 million  during fiscal 2013  compared to a 514 million  source of cash for fiscal 2012  a major driver of the change was the swing from net salesmaturities of shortterm investments in fiscal 2012 to net purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2013 reflective of the additional purchases of shortterm investments made with the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in april 2013 in fiscal 2012 there were 1124 million  of net salesmaturities of shortterm investments net of purchases while in fiscal 2013 we made 1203 million in net purchases of shortterm investments net of salesmaturities this impact was partially offset by 786 million  in proceeds from the sale of umbro and cole haan in fiscal 2013 

cash used by financing activities was 1040 million  for fiscal 2013  compared to 2118 million  for fiscal 2012  the decrease in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to 986 million  in proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt in april 2013 also contributing to the decrease were lower payments of longterm debt and notes payable and lower repurchases of common stock which were partially offset by a reduction in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2013  we purchased 335 million  shares of nike’s class b common stock for 17 billion  an average price of 4950 during the year we completed the fouryear 5 billion share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in september 2008 under that program we purchased a total of 1188 million  shares at an average price of 4208  subsequently we began repurchases under a fouryear 8 billion program approved by the board in september 2012 as of the end of fiscal 2013  we had repurchased 153 million  shares at a cost of 789 million  under this current program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on april 23 2013 we filed a shelf registration statement the shelf with the sec which permits us to issue an unlimited amount of debt securities the shelf expires on april 23 2017 on april 23 2013 we issued 10 billion of senior notes with tranches maturing in 2023 and 2043 the 2023 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 225 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2023 the 2043 senior notes were issued in an initial aggregate principal amount of 500 million at a 3625 fixed annual interest rate and will mature on may 1 2043 interest on the senior notes is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 of each year the issuance resulted in gross proceeds before expenses of 998 million we will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes which may include but are not 

limited to discharging or refinancing debt working capital capital expenditures share repurchases as yet unplanned acquisitions of assets or businesses and investments in subsidiaries 

on november 1 2011 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings with the option to increase borrowings to 15 billion with lender approval the facility matures november 1 2016 with a oneyear extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date provided that extensions shall not extend beyond november 1 2018 as of and for the year ended may 31 2013  we had no amounts outstanding under our committed credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of a and a1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2013  we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program during the year ended may 31 2013  we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of 505 million  as of may 31 2013  there were no outstanding borrowings under this program we may continue to issue commercial paper or other debt securities during fiscal 2014 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poors corporation and moodys investor services respectively 

as of may 31 2013  we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 60 billion  of which 35 billion  was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds tier1 commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations as of may 31 2013 the average duration of our shortterm investments and cash equivalents portfolio is 98 days 

despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the us we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the us through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits if we elect to raise capital in the us through debt we would incur additional interest expense  

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we routinely provide indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2013  and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 



 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number 

of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 447 million  excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2013  we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2013  refer to note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 



as of may 31 2013  letters of credit of 149 million  were outstanding which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 



in july 2012 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an accounting standards update intended to simplify how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary this accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning june 1 2013 and early adoption is permitted we early adopted this standard and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in september 2011 the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards this new guidance was effective for us beginning june 1 2012 the adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders’ equity companies are now required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this requirement was effective for us beginning june 1 2012 as this guidance only amended the presentation of the components of comprehensive income the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations further this guidance required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented this requirement will be effective for us beginning june 1 2013 as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 



in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments this new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements this new guidance is effective for us beginning june 1 2013 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 



our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the 

sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded our post invoice sales discounts consist of contractual programs with certain customers or discretionary discounts that are expected to be granted to certain customers at a later date we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales   

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant 

adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets   

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors we may first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount the twostep impairment test is unnecessary the twostep impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting units goodwill over its implied fair value if any 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting units business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinitelived intangible asset is impaired if after assessing the totality of events and circumstances we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinitelived intangible asset is not impaired no quantitative fair value measurement is necessary if a quantitative fair value measurement calculation is required for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

fair value measurements 

for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments including us treasury securities 

in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds us agency securities and money market funds level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our availableforsale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include an analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur 

we have used and may in the future use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net 

investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other income expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for trading or speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we have and may in the future also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where exposures are hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of exchange rate movements on our consolidated financial statements 

the timing for hedging exposures as well as the type and duration of the hedge instruments employed are guided by our hedging policies and determined based upon the nature of the exposure and prevailing market conditions generally hedged transactions are expected to be recognized within 12 to 18 months when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros british pounds and japanese yen see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps for a portion of our fixed rate debt 



we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 34 million and 21 million at may 31 2013 and 2012 respectively the var increased yearoveryear as a result of an increase in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative portfolio combined with a longer average duration on our outstanding trades at may 31 2013 such a hypothetical loss in the fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 49 million and 87 million during fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates at may 31 2013 



the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary

products 

 

 

we focus our product offerings in seven key categories running basketball football soccer men’s training women’s training nike sportswear our sportsinspired products and action sports we also market products designed for kids as well as for other athletic and recreational uses such as baseball cricket golf lacrosse outdoor activities football american tennis volleyball walking and wrestling 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men women and children nike sportswear running basketball football soccer and kids’ shoes are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future 

we sell sports apparel and accessories covering most of the above categories as well as athletic bags and accessory items nike apparel and accessories feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar use or by category we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos 

we sell a line of performance equipment under the nike brand name including bags socks sport balls eyewear timepieces digital devices bats gloves protective equipment golf clubs and other equipment designed for sports activities we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary nike ihm inc

 sales and marketing 

 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 — operating segments and related information of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 60 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment 

 

united states market 

 

 

in fiscal 2012 sales in the united states including us sales of our other businesses accounted for approximately 42 of total revenues compared to 43 in fiscal 2011 and 42 in fiscal 2010 our other businesses were primarily comprised of our affiliate brands cole haan converse hurley and umbro and nike golf we sell to thousands of retail accounts in the united states including a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal 2012 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24 of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal 2012 86 of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 87 in fiscal 2011 and 89 in fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2012 64 of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 60 in fiscal 2011 and 62 in fiscal 2010 

we utilize nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states as well as independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf skateboarding and snowboarding products in addition our direct to consumer operations sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwnikestorecom  and the following inline and factory retail outlets in the united states 

 

  

nike’s three significant distribution centers in the united states for nike brand products including nike golf are located in memphis tennessee nike also operates and leases one facility in memphis tennessee for nike brand product returns nike brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our foothill ranch california distribution center cole haan products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire and converse and hurley products are shipped primarily from ontario california 

 

international markets

significant customer 

 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales during fiscal 2012 

orders 

 

 

worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2012 were 112 billion compared to 105 billion for the same period last year this futures order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

 

product research and development 

 

 

we believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product and manufacturing process improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

 

manufacturing 

 

 

virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the united states in fiscal 2012 contract factories in vietnam china and indonesia manufactured approximately 41 32 and 25 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries the largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 5 of total fiscal 2012 nike brand footwear production almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 28 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china vietnam thailand sri lanka malaysia indonesia turkey cambodia mexico and el salvador the largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 8 of total fiscal 2012 apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2012 nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike as well as independent contractors in china and taiwan were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2012 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 19 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those jurisdictions such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2014 

  

 international operations and trade 

 

 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring 

the global economic recession resulted in a significant slowdown in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts such actions if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which may in turn adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

 

footwear imports into the european union 

 

 

in 2005 at the request of the european domestic footwear industry the european commission “ec” initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam together with other companies in our industry we took the position that special technology athletic footwear staf i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october 2006 on definitive duties of 165 for china and 10 for vietnam for nonstaf leather footwear but excluded staf from the final measures prior to the scheduled expiration in october 2008 of the measures imposed on the nonstaf footwear the domestic industry requested and the ec agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on nonstaf leather footwear in december 2009 following a review of the ongoing restrictions eu member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months until march 31 2011 in early 2011 the ec declined to further extend the measures and since april 1 2011 these restrictions have been terminated the ec noted at the time that it would monitor leather footwear imports from vietnam and china over the next 12 months no new trade defense actions have been taken by the ec 

on february 3 2010 the chinese government announced it would seek to refer the eu decision both on the original measures and subsequent review decision to the world trade organization “wto” for its further review and decision on may 18 2010 the dispute settlement body of the wto agreed to establish a panel to rule on china’s claims against the eu with respect to the above antidumping measures on october 28 2011 the wto issued a ruling in which it supported china’s positions on a number of issues neither party has filed an appeal 

 

footwear apparel and equipment imports into brazil and argentina 

 

 

at the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants both brazil and argentina have initiated independent antidumping investigations against footwear made in china over the last two years we have been working with a broad coalition of other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from china i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation in the case of argentina in 2010 the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us in the case of brazil the administering authorities agreed to impose an antidumping duty against nearly all footwear from china which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry this decision does not materially affect us in october 2011 the brazilian government initiated an anticircumvention investigation to determine whether chinesemade products or components were subject to minimal assembly or finishing in vietnam or indonesia to evade antidumping duties on chinesemade products in july 2012 the brazilian government found no circumvention was taking place and this matter is closed 

many products including footwear apparel and equipment that we and others in our industry import into argentina and brazil are subject to the wto nonautomatic licensing requirements which means that it may take up to 60 days for those products to clear customs and enter into those jurisdictions from time to time in addition to these wto licensing requirements these jurisdictions impose further importation restrictions or limitations as a result we have experienced delays in our ability to import our products or it has taken longer than the time allowed under the wto for us to import our products to date our business has not been materially affected by these restrictions or delays in the future however if we are unable to import our products into these jurisdictions due to these or other restrictions or if we experience increasing or more frequent delays beyond the wtopermitted 60 days to import our products our business could be materially affected 

 

footwear apparel and equipment imports into turkey 

 

 

in 2006 turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until august 2009 in june 2009 turkish shoemanufacturers submitted and the turkish government agreed to review a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures the turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until august 2012 but reduced the duty from 3 per pair of footwear to 160 per pair of footwear in june 2012 the government of turkey launched an expiry review on the footwear safeguards to assess if they should be extended for three additional years until august 2015 together with other companies in our industry we are advocating for exclusion of certain footwear products staf shoes that cannot be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty 

in 2011 two new safeguard measures and reviews were initiated by the turkish undersecretariat of foreign trade “uft” on apparel and equipment imports in january 2011 the uft began an investigation on apparel imports that could result in a 2030 increase in import duties applied to imported apparel products regardless of country of origin and with exceptions for eu 

  

 and countries that are included in a crosscumulation of origin system in the framework of the free trade agreements to which turkey is a party subject to evidence of preferential origin in july 2011 these higher import duties were approved and will be in place through july 2014 

together with other companies in our industry we advocated for exclusion of certain apparel products used for sporting activities that cannot be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty but no exclusion has been granted 

in february 2011 the uft began a review of existing safeguard measure on travel goods handbags and similar accessories and containers listed under applicable regulations one turkish bag manufacturers association has requested the continuation of the safeguard measures through april 2014 with the application of an additional import duty of 250kg max 375unit to 270kg max 425unit regardless of country of origin in october 2011 these higher import duties were approved and will be in place through april 2014 

together with other companies in our industry we advocated for the exclusion of nonleather bags from the scope of the continued safeguards but no exclusion has been granted 

 

trade relations with china 

 

 

china represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for us many governments around the world are concerned about china’s growing and fastpaced economy compliance with wto rules currency valuation and high trade surpluses as a result a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors eg services manufacturing and agriculture to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers china’s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community we believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multinational companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures 

in the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

 

competition 

 

 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

  

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

 

trademarks and patents 

 

 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 150 jurisdictions in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have over a thousand us and foreign utility patents and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components manufacturing techniques and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel athletic equipment digital devices and golf products these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2026 for design patents and from now to 2032 for utility patents we believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

 

employees 

 

 

as of may 31 2012 we had approximately 44000 employees worldwide including retail and parttime employees management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union and in the united states where certain employees of cole haan are represented by a union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require representation for employees by works councils such as in certain countries in the european union in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union and in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industry wide or national collective bargaining agreements there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

failure to maintain our reputation and brand image could negatively impact our business 

our iconic brands have worldwide recognition and our success depends on our ability to maintain and enhance our brand image and reputation maintaining promoting and growing our brands will depend on our design and marketing efforts including advertising and consumer campaigns as well as product innovation we could be adversely impacted if we fail to achieve any of these objectives or if the reputation or image of any of our brands is tarnished or receives negative publicity in addition adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers’ confidence in us and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations 

in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns negative posts or comments about us on social networking web sites could seriously damage our reputation and brand image if we do not maintain extend and expand our brand image then our product sales financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if 

  

 we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition we market our products globally through a diverse spectrum of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns including social media and online advertising if we do not successfully market our products or if advertising and promotional costs increase these factors could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation 

we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 

technical innovation and quality control in the design and manufacturing process of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumers if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we work with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks we impose and require our licensees to impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety however from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

global capital and credit market conditions and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

the uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world the current political and economic global environment has resulted in continued economic unpredictability particularly in europe where there are concerns regarding the increased debt levels of certain countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations as well as the overall stability of the euro currency continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures higher unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending in many parts of the world if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer 

  

 preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations shipping timing returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business as a result retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in almost 150 jurisdictions in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products 

the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights we may be subject to liability if third parties successfully claim that we infringe their trademarks patents or other intellectual property rights defending infringement claims could be expensive and timeconsuming and might result in our entering into costly license agreements we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain products 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately 

  

 predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in lower revenues higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our hedging activities see note 16 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are designed to minimize and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or reductions in the availability of materials or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the us or abroad and the consequences and effects thereof including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

  

 our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy breach interruption or security failure of that technology or any misappropriation of any data could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems and networks including the internet and thirdparty hosted services “information technology systems” across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution as well as for processing financial information for external and internal reporting purposes and other business activities our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these information technology systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new information technology systems in all of the geographical regions in which we operate over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance these systems and related processes in our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we also use information technology systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements if our information technology systems suffer severe damage disruption or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner we could experience delays in reporting our financial results which could result in lost revenues and profits as well as reputational damage 

in addition hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data our customers’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits in addition we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks 

furthermore we depend on information technology systems for digital marketing campaigns and activities and electronic communications throughout the world between and among our employees as well as with other third parties such as other customers suppliers and consumers our information technology systems are critical to many of our operating activities and our business processes may be negatively impacted by any service interruption or shutdown misuse leakage or falsification of information could result in a violation of data privacy laws and regulations and damage our reputation and credibility and have a negative impact on revenues and profits 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses product offering and manufacturing innovation and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 748 of our class a common stock if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 155 of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend  

nike designs develops markets and sells high quality footwear apparel equipment accessories and services worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and internet sales which we refer to as our “direct to consumer” operations and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and sales representatives worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment accessories and service businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling consumer experiences at retail and online 

in addition to achieving longterm revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals continue to be 

 

  

  

  

 over the past ten years we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals during this time nike inc’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9 and 15 respectively on an annual compounded basis our return on invested capital has increased from 15 to 22 and we expanded gross margins by 4 percentage points 

  

our fiscal 2012 results demonstrated our continued focus toward delivering appropriate returns to our shareholders while positioning ourselves for sustainable profitable longterm growth despite the ongoing challenges in the global economy we delivered record revenues and earnings per share in fiscal 2012 our revenues grew 16 to 241 billion net income increased 4 to 22 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 473 an 8 increase from fiscal 2011 

income before income taxes increased 5 for fiscal 2012 driven by revenue growth and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense which more than offset a decrease in gross margin and an increase in other expense the increase in revenues was driven by growth across all nike brand geographies key categories and product types brand strength innovative products and strong category retail presentation continues to fuel the demand for our nike brand products during fiscal 2012 we introduced a number of innovations including the nike fuelband and the flyknit technology the nike fuelband is a digital device that tracks one’s daily activities through a sporttested accelerometer while flyknit is a new footwear technology that uses advanced materials and proprietary manufacturing technology to produce a formfitting lightweight and seamless upper during this time we also expanded our nike  platform into our basketball and training categories and launched new high performance uniforms for all 32 nfl teams revenue for our other businesses also grew reflective of growth across most businesses led by converse our gross margin continued to be impacted by higher product input costs including materials and labor which more than offset the positive impacts of higher product selling prices the growth of our direct to consumer business and benefits from ongoing product cost reduction initiatives 

for fiscal 2012 the growth of our net income was negatively affected by a yearoveryear increase in our effective tax rate however diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 3 decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding driven by share repurchases during fiscal 2012 and 2011 

as part of our longterm growth strategy we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the nike brand and with the largest growth potential and highest returns on may 31 2012 we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the nike jordan converse and hurley brands for additional details refer to our “other businesses” section below 

while we will continue to face headwinds from higher input costs and foreign exchange volatility in fiscal 2013 we continue to see opportunities to drive future growth and remain committed to effectively managing our business to achieve our financial goals over the longterm by executing against the operational strategies outlined above

 consolidated operating results 

 

revenues 

 

  

  

  

  

   

 fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

on a currency neutral basis revenues for nike inc grew 14 for fiscal 2012 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and our other businesses excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates revenues for the nike brand increased 15 as every nike brand geography delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2012 north america contributed approximately 7 percentage points to the nike brand revenue increase while the emerging markets and greater china geographies contributed approximately 4 and 2 percentage points to the nike brand revenue growth respectively revenues for our other businesses grew 11 during fiscal 2012 contributing 1 percentage point of our consolidated revenue growth 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates nike brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 15 and 13 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues increased 16 during fiscal 2012 continuing to fuel the growth of our nike brand footwear business was the increased demand for performance products including the nike lunar and free technologies the increase in nike brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2012 was attributable to doubledigit percentage growth in unit sales along with a lowsingledigit percentage increase in average selling price per pair primarily reflecting the favorable impact from product price increases partially offset by higher discounts on closeout sales the overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth across all key categories notably running sportswear and basketball for nike brand apparel the increase in revenue for fiscal 2012 was driven by midsingledigit percentage increases in both unit sales and average selling prices the increase in average selling prices was primarily driven by product price increases partially offset by a higher mix of closeout sales the overall increase in apparel sales was reflective of increased demand across most key categories 

while wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall nike brand revenues we continue to see growth in revenue through our direct to consumer channels our nike brand direct to consumer operations include nike owned inline and factory stores as well as online sales through nike owned websites for fiscal 2012 direct to consumer channels represented approximately 17 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 16 in fiscal 2011 on a currency neutral basis direct to consumer revenues grew 21 for fiscal 2012 as comparable store sales grew 13 and we continue to expand our store network and ecommerce business comparable store sales include revenues from nike owned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met the store has been open at least one year square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year 

revenues for our other businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands cole haan converse hurley and umbro and nike golf excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for these businesses increased by 11 in fiscal 2012 reflecting growth across all businesses except hurley which was slightly down for the fiscal year 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

on both a reported and currency neutral basis revenues for nike inc grew 10 for fiscal 2011 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and our other businesses on a currency neutral basis revenues for the nike brand increased 10 for fiscal 2011 while revenues for our other businesses increased 8 excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates every nike brand geography except japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011 led by north america which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the nike brand revenue increase the emerging markets and greater china contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the nike brand revenue growth respectively 

by product group nike brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 12 and 10 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues declined 2 during fiscal 2011 fueling the growth of our nike brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products including the nike lunar and free technologies the increase in nike brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a highsingledigit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low singledigit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair the increase in unit sales was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in running men’s training action sports and women’s training products while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products and fewer closeouts as a percentage of total sales for nike brand apparel the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a lowdoubledigit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat the increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories 

for fiscal 2011 direct to consumer channels represented approximately 16 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 15 in fiscal 2010 on a currency neutral basis direct to consumer revenues grew 16 for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network increase comparable store sales and build our ecommerce business comparable store sales grew 11 for fiscal 2011 

excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for other businesses increased by 8 in fiscal 2011 reflecting doubledigit percentage revenue growth at converse cole haan and hurley and a lowsingledigit growth at umbro which more than offset a midsingledigit revenue decline at nike golf 

futures orders 

futures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2012 were 7 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period the us dollar futures order amount is calculated based upon our internal forecast of the currency exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period excluding the impact of currency changes futures orders increased 12 as unit orders and average selling price per unit each contributed approximately 6 percentage points of growth 

 

by geography futures orders growth was as follows 

 

  

   

  

 the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between futures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

 

gross margin 

 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 our consolidated gross margin was 220 basis points lower than the prior year period primarily driven by higher product input costs including materials and labor across most businesses also contributing to the decrease in gross margin were higher customs duty charges discounts on closeout sales and an increase in investments in our digital business and infrastructure together these factors decreased consolidated gross margin by approximately 390 basis points partially offsetting this decrease were positive impacts from product price increases lower air freight costs the growth of our nike brand direct to consumer business and benefits from our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year primarily driven by higher input costs transportation costs including additional air freight incurred to meet strong demand for nike brand products across most businesses and a lower mix of licensee revenue as distribution for certain markets within our other businesses transitioned from licensees to operating units of nike inc together these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011 with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our nike brand direct to consumer business a higher mix of fullprice sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives 

 

selling and administrative expense 

 

  

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

overall selling and administrative expense grew at a slower rate than revenues for fiscal 2012 

demand creation expense increased 11 compared to the prior year mainly driven by an increase in sports marketing expense marketing support for key product initiatives including the nike fuelband and nfl uniforms as well as an increased level of brand event spending around the european football championships and london summer olympics for fiscal 2012 changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of demand creation expense by 1 percentage point 

compared to the prior year operating overhead expense increased 11 primarily attributable to increased investments in our direct to consumer operations higher personnel costs as well as travel expenses to support the growth of our overall business for fiscal 2012 changes in currency exchange rates increased the growth of operating overhead expense by 1 percentage point 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2011 the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense 

demand creation expense increased 4 compared to the prior year primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the world cup and world basketball festival in the first half of fiscal 2011 as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers 

operating overhead expense increased 7 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our direct to consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year 

 

other expense income net 

 

   

 other expense income net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonoperating transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 other expense net increased 87 million compared to the prior year this change was primarily driven by a 76 million change in foreign currency net gains in the prior year to net losses in the current year these impacts together with a 24 million charge recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 for the restructuring of nike brand’s western europe operations were partially offset by certain net gains related to nonoperating items 

the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income net did not have a significant impact on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2012 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 other expense income net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains 

for fiscal 2011 we estimated that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related net gains included in other expense income net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 33 million on our income before income taxes 

 

income taxes 

 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 was 50 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 primarily due to changes in estimates of uncertain tax position this impact was partially offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate on operations outside of the united states as a result of changes in geographical mix of foreign earnings 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 primarily due to the change in geographic mix of earnings a larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the us where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the us this impact was partially offset by changes in estimates of uncertain tax positions 

 

operating segments 

 

 

the company’s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment

 north america 

 

   

 fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011

for fiscal 2012 footwear revenue in north america increased 15 driven by an increase in both unit sales and average selling prices unit sales rose at a doubledigit rate while average selling price per pair grew at a midsingledigit rate reflective of product price increases partially offset by higher discounts on closeout sales the overall increase in footwear sales was driven by growth in all key categories most notably running basketball women’s training and sportswear

for fiscal 2012 ebit for north america increased 16 as revenue growth and improved selling and administrative expense leverage more than offset a decline in gross margin gross margin decreased 90 basis points during fiscal 2012 primarily due to higher product input costs and lower gross margins on closeout sales which more than offset the favorable impact of selling price increases lower air freight costs and the growth of our direct to consumer business selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by 70 basis points for fiscal 2012 as both demand creation and operating overhead expense grew at a slower rate than revenues 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

revenues for north america increased 13 driven by doubledigit percentage growth in both wholesale and direct to consumer revenues contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season products north america’s direct to consumer revenues grew 19 which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to north america’s revenue increase the growth in the direct to consumer business was fueled by 14 growth in comparable store sales 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in north america footwear revenue was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in running men’s and women’s training and football soccer and a singledigit percentage growth in basketball partially offset by a lowsingledigit percentage decline in sales of our nike brand sportswear products 

the yearoveryear increase in north america apparel revenues was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in most key categories most notably men’s training running basketball and women’s training 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in north america’s ebit was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage the decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our direct to consumer business and fewer closeout sales

on a reported basis ebit for japan grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of improved gross margin and leverage of selling and administrative expenses the increase in japan’s gross margin was mainly driven by the favorable impact from the yearoveryear change in standard currency rates a decrease in inventory obsolescence expense as well as a lower mix of closeout sales these favorable impacts were partially offset by higher product input costs 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

on march 11 2011 japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami while the company’s organization and assets in japan were not materially damaged business results for the month of march 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates both footwear and apparel revenues in japan declined driven by decreases across most key categories partially offsetting the decreases was doubledigit percentage growth in revenues from running apparel 

the decrease in japan’s ebit for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage the improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on closeout sales which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense 

  

 emerging markets 

 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for the emerging markets increased 26 for fiscal 2012 as all territories in the geography reported doubledigit revenue growth led by argentina brazil mexico and korea 

for fiscal 2012 revenue growth for both footwear and apparel in the emerging markets was driven by doubledigit percentage growth in unit sales and midsingledigit percentage growth in average selling price per unit primarily reflective of product price increases the overall increase in emerging markets’ footwear and apparel sales was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories led by running and sportswear 

the increase in emerging markets’ ebit for fiscal 2012 was primarily the result of revenue growth and selling and administrative expense leverage which more than offset a lower gross margin gross margin declined 150 basis points for the fiscal year primarily due to higher product input costs customs duty charges and inventory obsolescence expense these factors were partially offset by the favorable impact of changes in standard currency exchange rates and product price increases selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues decreased 140 basis points as both demand creation expense and operating overhead grew at a slower rate than revenues 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for emerging markets increased 19 for fiscal 2011 most territories in the geography reported doubledigit revenue growth for the fiscal year led by brazil argentina mexico and korea 

for fiscal 2011 both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the emerging markets was driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories most notably sportswear and running 

for fiscal 2011 ebit for emerging markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of inline product sales lower warehousing costs and favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher fullprice discounts 

 

global brand divisions 

 

  

global brand divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the nike brand revenues for the global brand divisions are attributable to nike brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment 

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 global brand divisions’ loss before interest and taxes increased 206 million primarily driven by increased investments in our digital business and infrastructure for our direct to consumer operations higher sports marketing expense as well as higher personnel costs to support our global brand functions 

  

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in global brand divisions’ loss before interest and taxes was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense the increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our direct to consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense the increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the world cup and world basketball festival in the first half of fiscal 2011 as well as increased investments in sports marketing 

  

 other businesses 

 

  

fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

our other businesses are comprised of our affiliate brands cole haan converse hurley and umbro and nike golf 

for fiscal 2012 revenues for our other businesses increased 11 reflecting growth across most businesses led by converse the revenue growth at converse was primarily driven by increased sales in north america and china as well as increased revenues in the uk as we transitioned that market to direct distribution in the second half of fiscal 2011 excluding changes in currency exchange rates revenues for nike golf increased 9 for fiscal 2012 driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our apparel business partially offset by a singledigit percentage decline in our club business on a currency neutral basis revenues for umbro grew 14 primarily driven by sales growth in france due to our acquisition of the exclusive licensee and distributor in march 2011 for fiscal 2012 revenues for cole haan grew 3 mostly driven by growth in our direct to consumer operations 

on a reported basis revenues for our other businesses increased 11 for fiscal 2012 while ebit grew 2 as earnings growth at converse was mostly offset by losses at umbro and hurley higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues negatively affected profitability at both companies while lower gross margins also contributed to the decline in hurley’s earnings 

as part of our longterm growth strategy we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses to ensure the company is investing in those businesses that are accretive to the nike brand and with the largest growth potential and highest returns on may 31 2012 we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses which will allow us to focus our resources on driving growth in the nike jordan converse and hurley brands for fiscal 2012 and 2011 cole haan and umbro combined contributed 797 million and 745 million respectively in revenues to the other businesses portfolio and losses before interest and taxes of 43 million and 18 million respectively 

we are currently in the process of preparing these businesses for sale and identifying suitable buyers although we are unable to estimate the ultimate gains or losses on the sales of these businesses at this time we anticipate we will in the future incur certain noncash charges related to the divestiture of umbro upon the sale of the business or when the ultimate selling price becomes estimable we expect to incur noncash charges to liquidate certain balance sheet accounts most significantly the cumulative translation adjustment and deferred tax assets related to umbro at may 31 2012 the cumulative translation adjustment was 110 million net of tax and the deferred tax asset was 32 million we may also incur other cash and noncash charges related to the divestiture of the cole haan and umbro businesses 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 the revenue growth at converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in china as well as increased sales in the uk as we transitioned that market to direct distribution revenues for cole haan increased 12 driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as highsingledigit percentage growth in our direct to consumer operations revenues declined at nike golf where we experienced significant erosion in our japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 

for fiscal 2011 ebit for our other businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts gross margin remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011 as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011 

 

corporate 

 

  

corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses including expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation certain foreign currency gains and losses including certain hedge gains and losses corporate eliminations and other items 

corporate revenues primarily consist of certain intercompany revenue eliminations and foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments and other businesses but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program 

in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program other conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates used to record nonfunctional currency denominated product purchases within the nike brand geographic operating segments and other businesses 

  

 fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 

for fiscal 2012 corporate expense grew 111 million mainly due to an increase of 49 million in performancebased compensation and a yearoveryear net increase of 73 million from foreign currency impacts these foreign currency impacts were driven by a yearoveryear increase in foreign currency net losses arising from certain eurous dollar foreign currency hedges and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in various nonfunctional currencies net of related undesignated forward instruments as a variety of foreign currencies weakened against the us dollar yearoveryear the above impacts were partially offset by a slight decrease in centrally managed operating overhead expenses 

  

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 the decrease in corporate expense was primarily driven by yearoveryear net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program also contributing to the decrease in corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a 54 million yearoveryear reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year these benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses primarily driven by higher wagerelated expense 

 

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

 

overview 

 

as a global company with significant operations outside the united states in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates our primary foreign currency exposures arise from the recording of transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows such as the euro and chinese renminbi into us dollars 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical by hedging a portion of the remaining material exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options as described below the implementation of our foreign currency adjustment program enhanced our ability to manage our foreign exchange risk on a portfolio basis by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits that exist within our portfolio of aggregate foreign exchange exposure our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the impact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged where hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

 

transactional exposures 

 

we conduct business in various currencies and have transactions which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and may also elect to use currency forward and option contracts to hedge the remaining effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including certain product cost exposures nonfunctional currency denominated external sales and other costs described above these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging except for hedges of the embedded derivatives component of the product costs exposure as discussed below as of may 31 2012 there were outstanding currency forward contracts with maturities up to 24 months the fair value of outstanding currency forward contracts at may 31 2012 and 2011 was 183 million and 28 million in assets and 32 million and 136 million in liabilities respectively the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income “oci” a component of shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect consolidated earnings the ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income net ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended may 31 2012 2011 and 2010 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage the foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement and the embedded derivative contracts discussed above are not formally designated as hedging instruments under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging accordingly changes in fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in other expense income net and are intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency denominated asset or liability or the embedded derivative contract being hedged the fair value of undesignated instruments was 55 million and 9 million in assets and 20 million and 17 million in liabilities at may 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 16 – risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded 

translational exposures 

many of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets operational results and cash flows of these subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries’ nonus dollar denominated balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders’ equity in the translation of our consolidated statements of income a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues was a benefit detriment of approximately 268 million and 28 million for the years ended may 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our income before income taxes was a benefit detriment of approximately 74 million and 16 million for the years ended may 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts andor options to mitigate the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments the combination of the purchase and sale of the us dollar investment and the hedging instrument has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may 31 2012 and 2011 was 27 million and 1 million in assets and 3 million and 21 million in liabilities respectively the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other expense income net in the period during which the hedged availableforsale investment is sold and affects earnings any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income net the impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented 

the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other expense income net had an insignificant impact on our income before income taxes for the year ended may 31 2012 and had a unfavorable impact of approximately 33 million for the year ended may 31 2011 

refer to note 6 — fair value measurements and note 16 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional description of how the above financial instruments are valued and recorded 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we hedge certain net investment positions in eurofunctional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other expense income net the impact of ineffective hedges was not material for any period presented to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci there were no outstanding net investment hedges as of may 31 2012 at may 31 2011 the fair value was 23 million in liabilities cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled 22 million and 23 million for the years ended may 31 2012 and 2011 respectively 

  

 liquidity and capital resources 

 

 

cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 19 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to 18 billion for fiscal 2011 our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2012 was net income of 22 billion our working capital was a net cash outflow of 799 million for fiscal 2012 as compared to a net cash outflow of 708 million for fiscal 2011 our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and prepaid expenses inventory at the end of fiscal 2012 increased 23 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to higher product input costs as well as changes in product mix which more than offset the favorable impact of changes in currency exchange rates inventory units for the nike brand grew 10 compared to the prior year driven by growth in futures orders and improved factory deliveries the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily driven by higher prepaid demand creation expenses around the european football championships and london summer olympics 

cash provided by investing activities was 514 million during fiscal 2012 compared to a use of cash of 1021 million for fiscal 2011 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to higher net sales and maturities of shortterm investments of 1124 million net of purchases in fiscal 2012 compared to net purchases of 537 million net of sales and maturities during fiscal 2011 

cash used by financing activities was 21 billion for fiscal 2012 compared to 20 billion for fiscal 2011 the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to higher payments of longterm debt notes payable and dividends which was partially offset by an increase in the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2012 we purchased 200 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 18 billion these repurchases were made under the fouryear 5 billion program approved by our board of directors in september 2008 under which stock repurchase activities commenced in december 2009 as of the end of fiscal 2012 we have repurchased 503 million shares for 41 billion under this program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

capital resources 

on november 1 2011 we entered into a committed credit facility agreement with a syndicate of banks which provides for up to 1 billion of borrowings pursuant to a revolving credit facility with the option to increase borrowings to 15 billon with lender approval the facility matures in november 2016 with a oneyear extension option prior to both the second and third anniversary of the closing date provided that extensions shall not extend beyond november 1 2018 this facility replaces the prior 1 billion committed credit facility agreement that would have expired in december 2012 as of and for the year ended may 31 2012 we had no amounts outstanding under our new committed revolving credit facility 

we currently have longterm debt ratings of a and a1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed revolving credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any thenoutstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed revolving credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility and failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks in the syndicate any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2012 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program as of and for the year ended may 31 2012 no amounts were outstanding under this program we may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

our previous 760 million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission expired during fiscal 2012 no debt securities were issued under that shelf registration prior to its expiry we may issue debt securities under a new shelf registration in fiscal 2013 depending on general corporate needs 

as of may 31 2012 we had cash cash equivalents and shortterm investments totaling 38 billion of which 25 billion was held by our foreign subsidiaries cash equivalents and shortterm investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds tier1 commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and shortterm investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of may 31 2012 

despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where they are needed we routinely repatriate a portion of our foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided we also indefinitely reinvest a significant portion of our foreign earnings and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings should we require additional capital in the us we may elect to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds or raise capital in the us through debt if we were to repatriate indefinitely reinvested foreign funds we would be required to accrue and pay additional us taxes less applicable foreign tax credits if we elect to raise capital in the us through debt we would incur additional interest expense 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

 contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2012 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

 

  

  

  

  

 the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 285 million excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2012 we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2012 please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2012 letters of credit of 138 million were outstanding which were generally issued for the purchase of inventory and as guarantees of the company’s performance under certain selfinsurance and other programs 

recently adopted accounting standards 

 

 

in april 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards this new guidance which became effective for us beginning march 1 2012 amends current us gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in january 2010 the fasb issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements the guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value the valuation techniques and inputs used the activity in level 3 fair value measurements and the transfers between levels 1 2 and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy this guidance became effective for us beginning march 1 2010 except for disclosures relating to purchases sales issuances and settlements of level 3 assets and liabilities which became effective for us beginning june 1 2011 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting additionally these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration these new standards became effective for us beginning june 1 2011 the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

 recently issued accounting standards 

 

 

in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements surrounding the nature of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments this new guidance requires companies to disclose both gross and net information about instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments and transactions subject to master netting arrangements this new guidance is effective for us beginning june 1 2013 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in september 2011 the fasb issued updated guidance on the periodic testing of goodwill for impairment this guidance will allow companies to assess qualitative factors to determine if it is morelikelythannot that goodwill might be impaired and whether it is necessary to perform the twostep goodwill impairment test required under current accounting standards this new guidance is effective for us beginning june 1 2012 we do not expect the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2011 the fasb issued guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders’ equity companies will now be required to present the components of net income and other comprehensive income in either one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this guidance also required companies to present reclassification adjustments out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component in both the statement in which net income is presented and the statement in which other comprehensive income is presented however in december 2011 the fasb issued guidance which indefinitely defers the requirement related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments both issuances on the presentation of comprehensive income are effective for us beginning june 1 2012 as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income we do not anticipate the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

 

critical accounting policies 

 

 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods of up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers and estimated returns discounts and claims expected but not yet finalized with our customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

  

 contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies that would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset group’s carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit planned divestitures or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value if any 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded companies in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

on may 31 2012 we announced our intention to divest of the cole haan and umbro businesses as of may 31 2012 cole haan had no goodwill or indefinitelived intangible assets on our balance sheet while umbro had 70 million of goodwill and 164 million of trademark and other intangible assets as of may 31 2012 both asset groups for cole haan and umbro did not quality as “assetsheldforsale” under applicable accounting guidance the decision to divest these businesses was deemed a triggering event to perform an impairment analysis of umbro’s intangible assets at that date and was considered in our fourth quarter impairment analysis we are currently in the process of preparing the businesses for divestiture and identifying potential acquirers therefore we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of the umbro reporting unit because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis as discussed above the asset groups for umbro did not qualify as “assetsheldforsale” therefore we did not consider potential disposition costs or cumulative translation adjustments in the carrying value of the umbro reporting unit in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter impairment analysis because we are still in the preliminary stages of the divestiture process and have not yet identified potential acquirers or the likely deal structure these methods represent our best estimate of the fair value of the umbro business our analysis determined there was no impairment of intangible assets or goodwill related to umbro if the sales process indicates a fair value that is below the current carrying value of the reporting unit an analysis would be required to determine if impairment charges exist at that point 

  

 fair value measurements 

for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction with a market participant at the measurement date in general and where applicable we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine the fair values of our financial instruments this pricing methodology applies to our level 1 investments including us treasury securities 

in the absence of active markets for identical assets or liabilities such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active this pricing methodology applies to our level 2 investments such as commercial paper and bonds us agency securities and money market funds level 3 investments are valued using internally developed models with unobservable inputs assets and liabilities measured using unobservable inputs are an immaterial portion of our portfolio 

a majority of our availableforsale securities are priced by pricing vendors and are generally level 1 or level 2 investments as these vendors either provide a quoted market price in an active market or use observable inputs without applying significant adjustments in their pricing observable inputs include broker quotes interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals volatilities and credit risks our fair value processes include controls that are designed to ensure appropriate fair values are recorded these controls include an analysis of periodoverperiod fluctuations and comparison to another independent pricing vendor 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedging probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the cumulative changes in fair values of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract from other comprehensive income to other expense income net during the quarter in which such changes occur 

we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels the cumulative change in fair value of the overhedged portion of the related hedge contract would be reported directly to earnings in the period in which changes occur 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested outside the us thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcome the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year this estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

  

 other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of thirdparty claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense income net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability while we cannot predict the outcome of pending legal matters with certainty we do not believe any currently identified claim proceeding or litigation either individually or in aggregate will have a material impact on our results of operations financial position or cash flows

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend  

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including thirdparty and intercompany transactions we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries where hedged our program has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons 

when we begin hedging exposures the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros british pounds and japanese yen see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps 

 

market risk measurement 

 

 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjust the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 21 million and 33 million at may 31 2012 and 2011 respectively the var decreased yearoveryear primarily as a result of decreased foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2012 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 87 million and 79 million during fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above therefore we consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of thirdparty debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may 31 2012 

  

  the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary

sales and marketing 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 18 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 83 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment effective june 1 2009 we began operating under our new organizational structure for the nike brand which consists of the following six geographies north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets previously nike brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions us europe middle east and africa collectively “emea” asia pacific and americas our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment 

united states market 

in fiscal 2011 sales in the united states including us sales of our other businesses accounted for approximately 43 of total revenues compared to 42 in fiscal 2010 and 2009 our other businesses were primarily comprised of our affiliate brands cole haan converse hurley and umbro which was acquired on march 3 2008 and nike golf we estimate that we sell to more than 20000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal 2011 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 23 of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal 2011 87 of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 89 in fiscal 2010 and 2009 in fiscal 2011 60 of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 62 in fiscal 2010 and 60 in fiscal 2009 

  

we utilize 18 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 4 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 5 for skateboarding and snowboarding products in addition our direct to consumer operations sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwnikestorecom  and the following retail outlets in the united states 

 

 nike’s three significant distribution centers in the united states for nike brand products including nike golf are located in memphis tennessee nike also operates and leases one facility in memphis tennessee for nike brand product returns nike brand apparel and equipment products are also shipped from our foothill ranch california distribution center cole haan products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire and converse and hurley products are shipped primarily from ontario california

significant customer 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales during fiscal 2011 

orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2011 were 103 billion compared to 88 billion for the same period last year this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between futuresadvance and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these futuresadvance orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

product research and development 

we believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials concepts for product improvements and compliance with product safety regulations around the world employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

manufacturing 

virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the united states in fiscal 2011 contract factories in vietnam china indonesia and india manufactured approximately 39 33 24 and 2 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries the largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 6 of total fiscal 2011 nike brand footwear production almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 33 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china thailand vietnam malaysia sri lanka indonesia turkey cambodia el salvador and mexico the largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 7 of total fiscal 2011 apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2011 nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike as well as independent contractors in china and taiwan were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike’s independent contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk for the manufacturing of our footwear apparel and equipment products most raw materials are available and purchased 

  

by those independent contractors and suppliers in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company and the sole owner of our redeemable preferred stock has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2011 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 19 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers in those jurisdictions such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2014 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring 

the global economic recession resulted in a significant slowdown in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts such actions if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

footwear imports into the european union 

in 2005 at the request of the european domestic footwear industry the european commission “ec” initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam together with other companies in our industry we took the position that special technology athletic footwear staf i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october 2006 on definitive duties of 165 for china and 10 for vietnam for nonstaf leather footwear but excluded staf from the final measures prior to the scheduled expiration in october 2008 of the measures imposed on the nonstaf footwear the domestic industry requested and the ec agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on nonstaf leather footwear in december 2009 following a review of the ongoing restrictions eu member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months until march 31 2011 in early 2011 the ec declined to further extend the measures and since april 1 2011 these restrictions have been terminated the ec noted that it will be monitoring leather footwear imports from vietnam and china over the next 12 months and it is hoped that any increases will not result in renewed trade defense actions by the ec 

on february 3 2010 the chinese government announced it would seek to refer the eu decision both on the original measures and subsequent review decision to the world trade organization “wto” for its further review and decision on may 18 2010 the dispute settlement body of the wto agreed to establish a panel to rule on china’s claims against the eu with respect to the above antidumping measures the ruling from the wto panel is expected in late july or august 2011 after which either party may accept or appeal the findings 

  

footwear apparel and equipment imports into brazil and argentina 

at the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants both brazil and argentina have initiated independent antidumping investigations against footwear made in china over the last two years we have been working with a broad coalition of other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from china i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation in the case of argentina in 2010 the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us in the case of brazil the administering authorities agreed to impose an antidumping duty against nearly all footwear from china which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry although we do not currently expect that this decision will materially affect us we are working with the same broad coalition of footwear companies to challenge this decision in domestic brazilian courts as well as international forums such as the wto 

many products including footwear apparel and equipment products that we and others in our industry import into argentina and brazil are subject to the wto nonautomatic licensing requirements which means that it may take up to 60 days for those products to clear customs and enter into those jurisdictions from time to time in addition to these wto licensing requirements these jurisdictions impose further importation restrictions or limitations as a result we have experienced delays in our ability to import our products or it has taken longer than the time allowed under the wto for us to import our products to date our business has not been materially affected by these restrictions or delays in the future however if we are unable to import our products into these jurisdictions due to these or other restrictions or if we experience increasing or more frequent delays beyond the wtopermitted 60 days to import our products our business could be materially affected 

footwear apparel and equipment imports into turkey 

in 2006 turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until august 2009 in june 2009 turkish shoemanufacturers submitted and the turkish government agreed to review a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures the turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until august 2012 but reduced the duty from 3 per pair of footwear to 160 per pair of footwear 

in 2011 two new safeguard measures and reviews were initiated by the turkish undersecretariat of foreign trade “uft” on apparel and equipment imports in january 2011 the uft began an investigation on apparel imports that could result in a 2030 increase in import duties applied to imported apparel products regardless of country of origin and with only a few exceptions for countries that currently have a free trade agreement with turkey a decision is expected in late july 2011 and if approved these higher import duties will be in place through july 2014 together with other companies in our industry we are advocating for exclusion of certain apparel products used for sporting activities that cannot be manufactured in turkey and therefore should not be subject to a higher import duty in february 2011 the uft began a review of existing safeguard measure on travel goods handbags and similar accessories and containers listed under applicable regulations one turkish bag manufacturers association has requested the continuation of the safeguard measures through april 2014 with the application of an additional import duty of 270 usdkg max 425 usdunit regardless of country of origin together with other companies in our industry we are advocating for the exclusion of nonleather bags from the scope of the continued safeguards 

trade relations with china 

china represents an important sourcing country and consumer marketing country for us many governments around the world are concerned about china’s growing and fastpaced economy compliance with wto rules currency valuation and high trade surpluses as a result a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns while some of these concerns may be justified we are working with broad 

  

coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors eg services manufacturing and agriculture to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers china’s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community we believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multinational companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures 

in the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

trademarks and patents 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying our brands and the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign utility patents and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2025 for design patents and from now to 2031 for utility patents we believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

as of may 31 2011 we had approximately 38000 employees worldwide which includes retail and parttime employees management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees 

  

is represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union and in the united states where certain employees of cole haan are represented by a union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require representation for employees by works councils such as in certain countries in the european union in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union and in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industry wide or national collective bargaining agreements there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment 

  

industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 

although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products technical innovation and quality control in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumers if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

  

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks we impose and require our licensees to impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers we also require these contractors to comply with applicable standards for product safety however from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation or result in a product recall and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

global capital and credit market conditions and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures higher unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending in the united states and internationally if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including manufacturing and transportation costs shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

  

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business as a result retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately 

  

predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation product safety regulations or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins and earnings 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our hedging activities see note 17 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are designed to minimize and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they 

  

also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

natural disasters could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition the march 11 2011 japanese earthquake and resulting tsunami negatively affected our japanese revenue and profits for the fourth quarter ended may 31 2011 and we expect those events to continue to adversely affect us during fiscal year 2012 

natural disasters such as earthquakes hurricanes tsunamis or other adverse weather and climate conditions whether occurring in the us or abroad and the consequences and effects thereof including energy shortages and public health issues could disrupt our operations or the operations of our vendors and other suppliers or result in economic instability that may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition 

  

on march 11 2011 japan experienced a significant earthquake and resulting tsunami the implications from ongoing events and widespread damage to the nation’s infrastructure consumer confidence and overall economy remain unclear our revenues and profits for our japan businesses were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011 and although we cannot fully assess the future financial impact of these ongoing events we do expect our japanese businesses to continue to be adversely impacted throughout fiscal 2012 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology to operate our business including our supply chain and retail operations and any failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our reputation or our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

hackers and data thieves are increasingly sophisticated and operate large scale and complex automated attacks any breach of our network may result in the loss of valuable business data our customers’ or employees’ personal information or a disruption of our business which could give rise to unwanted media attention damage our customer relationships and reputation and result in lost sales fines or lawsuits in addition we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect this business and personal data an inability to maintain compliance with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal risks 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

  

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 746 of our class a common stock if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 178 of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threefourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet analyst expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend nike designs develops markets and sells high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and internet sales which we refer to as our “direct to consumer” operations and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences 

in addition to achieving longterm revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operational excellence in several key areas 

 

  

  

  

  

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals continue to be 

 

  

  

  

   

over the past ten years we have achieved or exceeded all of these financial goals during this time nike inc’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 8 and 15 respectively on an annual compounded basis our return on invested capital has increased from 14 to 22 and we expanded gross margins by more than 5 percentage points 

our fiscal 2011 results demonstrated our continued focus toward meeting our financial goals while positioning ourselves for sustainable profitable longterm growth despite the uncertain macroeconomic environment in fiscal 2011 we delivered record high revenues and diluted earnings per share our revenues grew 10 to 209 billion net income increased 12 to 21 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 439 a 14 increase from fiscal 2010 

income before income taxes increased 13 for fiscal 2011 primarily as a result of the increase in revenues and leverage on selling and administrative expense which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage the increase in revenues is reflective of increased demand for nike brand footwear and apparel products across most businesses particularly in the north america emerging markets and greater china geographies demand for our nike brand footwear and apparel was fueled by our innovative products as well as strong category focused retail presentations the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by higher product input costs increased transportation expenses and a lower mix of licensee revenue as certain markets within our other businesses transitioned to nike inc owned markets these factors more than offset the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our nike brand direct to consumer business and our ongoing product cost reduction initiatives 

net income for fiscal 2011 was negatively impacted by a yearoveryear increase of 80 basis points in our effective tax rate driven primarily by an increase in the percentage of total pretax income earned from operations in the united states the united states statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside the united states 

for the year diluted earnings per share grew at a higher rate than net income due to a 2 decrease in the weighted average number of diluted common shares outstanding driven by our share repurchases during fiscal 2011 while we increased the use of working capital in fiscal 2011 to support the growth of our businesses we returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2010 

while we continue to believe that the company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions 

  

results of operations 

 

 consolidated operating results 

revenues 

 

  

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

on both a reported and currency neutral basis revenues for nike inc grew 10 for fiscal 2011 driven by increases in revenues for both the nike brand and our other businesses on a currency neutral basis revenues for the nike brand increased 10 for fiscal 2011 while revenues for our other businesses increased 8 excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates every nike brand geography except japan delivered higher revenues for fiscal 2011 led by north america which contributed approximately 5 percentage points to the nike brand revenue increase the emerging markets and greater china contributed approximately 3 and 2 percentage points to the nike brand revenue growth respectively 

by product group nike brand footwear and apparel revenue increased 11 and 9 respectively while nike brand equipment revenues declined 2 during fiscal 2011 fueling the growth of our nike brand footwear business was the increased demand in our performance products including the nike lunar and free technologies which are used across multiple categories the increase in nike brand footwear revenue for fiscal 2011 was attributable to a high singledigit percentage increase in unit sales along with a low singledigit percentage increase in the average selling price per pair the increase in unit sales was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in running men’s training action sports and women’s training products while the increase in average selling price per pair was primarily driven by price increases on selected products 

  

and fewer closeouts as a percentage of total sales for nike brand apparel the increase in revenue for fiscal 2011 was primarily driven by a low doubledigit percentage increase in unit sales attributable to strong category presentations and improved product lines while the average selling price per unit was relatively flat the increase in unit sales was driven by increased demand in all key categories 

while wholesale revenues remain the largest component of overall nike brand revenues we continue to see growth in revenue through our direct to consumer channels our nike brand direct to consumer operations include nike owned inline and factory stores as well as online sales through nike owned websites for fiscal 2011 direct to consumer channels represented approximately 16 of our total nike brand revenues compared to 15 in fiscal 2010 on a currency neutral basis direct to consumer revenues grew 16 for fiscal 2011 as we continue to expand our store network increase comparable store sales and build our ecommerce business comparable store sales grew 11 for fiscal 2011 comparable store sales include revenues from nike owned inline and factory stores for which all three of the following requirements have been met the store has been open at least one year square footage has not changed by more than 15 within the past year and the store has not been permanently repositioned within the past year 

revenues for our other businesses consist of results from our affiliate brands cole haan converse hurley and umbro and nike golf excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for these businesses increased by 8 in fiscal 2011 reflecting doubledigit percentage revenue growth at converse cole haan and hurley and a low singledigit growth at umbro which more than offset a mid singledigit revenue decline at nike golf 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates revenues for nike inc declined 2 driven primarily by a 2 decline in revenues for the nike brand all of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of emerging markets reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets most notably in our western europe and central  eastern europe geographies by product group revenues for our worldwide nike brand footwear business were down 1 compared to the prior year worldwide nike brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5 and 7 respectively our direct to consumer operations represented approximately 15 of our total nike brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13 in fiscal 2009 

excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for our other businesses increased by 4 for fiscal 2010 driven by increased revenues at converse umbro and hurley which more than offset revenue declines at nike golf and cole haan 

futures orders 

futures and advance orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2011 were 15 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates excluding the impact of currency changes futures orders increased 12 primarily driven by a high singledigit percentage increase in unit sales volume and a low singledigit percentage increase in average price per unit for both footwear and apparel products 

by geography futures orders growth was as follows 

 

   

 

 the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advancefutures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike brand footwear and apparel sales of nike brand equipment sales from our direct to consumer operations and sales from our other businesses 

gross margin 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 our consolidated gross margin percentage was 70 basis points lower than the prior year the primary factors contributing to this decrease were as follows 

 

  

  

 together these factors decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 130 basis points for fiscal 2011 with the most significant erosion in the second half of the fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by the positive impact from the growth and expanding profitability of our nike brand direct to consumer business a higher mix of fullprice sales and favorable impacts from our ongoing product cost efficiency initiatives 

as we head into fiscal 2012 we anticipate that our gross margins will continue to face pressure from macroeconomic factors most notably rising product input costs as well as higher transportation costs which may more than offset the favorable impact from our planned price increases and ongoing production cost efficiency initiatives 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year the primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows 

 

   

  

 together these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010 these increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates primarily affecting our emerging markets and central  eastern europe geographies 

selling and administrative expense 

 

  

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

in fiscal 2011 the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on selling and administrative expense 

demand creation expense increased 4 compared to the prior year primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the world cup and world basketball festival in the first half of fiscal 2011 as well as increased spending around key product initiatives and investments in retail product presentation with wholesale customers 

operating overhead expense increased 7 compared to the prior year this increase was primarily attributable to increased investments in our direct to consumer operations as well as growth in our wholesale operations where we incurred higher personnel costs and travel expenses as compared to the prior year 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising 

excluding changes in exchange rates operating overhead expense increased 4 compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performancebased compensation and investments in our direct to consumer operations these increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2009 we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure enhance consumer focus drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure as a result of these actions we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5 and incurred pretax restructuring charges of 195 million in fiscal 2009 primarily consisting of cash severance costs these charges are included in “corporate” for segment reporting purposes 

  

goodwill intangibles and other assets impairment 

in fiscal 2009 we recognized noncash impairment charges of 199 million and 202 million relating to umbro’s goodwill intangibles and other assets respectively although umbro’s financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition this erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets particularly in the united kingdom and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business 

for additional information about our impairment charges see note 4 – acquisition identifiable intangible assets goodwill and umbro impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other income net 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

other income net is comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments as well as unusual or nonrecurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business for fiscal 2011 other income net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains 

for fiscal 2011 we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related net gains included in other income net had an unfavorable impact of approximately 33 million on our income before income taxes 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 and 2009 other income net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of nike bauer hockey 

for fiscal 2010 we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related net gains included in other income net increased our income before income taxes by approximately 34 million 

income taxes 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 was 80 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2010 due primarily to the change in geographic mix of earnings a larger percentage of our earnings in fiscal 2011 were attributable to operations in the us where the statutory tax rate is generally higher than the tax rate on operations outside of the us this impact was partially offset by changes to uncertain tax positions 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of umbro’s 

  

goodwill intangible and other assets excluding this tax benefit our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 265 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to our international operations as tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate 

operating segments 

the company’s reportable operating segments are based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design development marketing and selling of athletic footwear apparel and equipment our reportable operating segments for the nike brand are north america western europe central  eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets our nike brand direct to consumer operations are managed within each geographic segment 

as part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each nike brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any nonfunctional currency revenues or product purchases into the entity’s functional currency geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates for all nike brand operating segments differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program prior to fiscal 2010 all foreign currency results including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the western europe and central  eastern europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results 

certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2011 presentation as south africa became part of the emerging markets operating segment beginning june 1 2010 previously south africa was part of the central  eastern europe operating segment 

the breakdown of revenues follows 

 

  

  

  

   

 the primary financial measure used by the company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes commonly referred to as “ebit” which represents net income before interest expense income net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income as discussed in note 18 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements certain corporate costs are not included in ebit of our operating segments 

the breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows 

 

  

 north america 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

revenues for north america increased 13 driven by doubledigit percentage growth in both wholesale and direct to consumer revenues contributing to the wholesale revenue growth was strong product category presentations at our wholesale customers improved product lines and earlier shipments of summer season 

  

products north america’s direct to consumer revenues grew 19 which contributed approximately 4 percentage points to north america’s revenue increase the growth in the direct to consumer business was fueled by 14 growth in comparable store sales 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in north america footwear revenue was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in running men’s and women’s training and football soccer categories and a singledigit percentage growth in basketball partially offset by a low singledigit percentage decline in sales of our nike brand sportswear products 

the yearoveryear increase in north america apparel revenues was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in most key categories most notably men’s training running basketball and women’s training 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in north america’s ebit was primarily the result of revenue growth and leverage on selling and administrative expense which more than offset a lower gross margin percentage the decline in gross margin percentage was due primarily to increased air freight and product input costs which more than offset the favorable impact from the growth of our direct to consumer business and fewer closeout sales 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for north america declined 1 driven primarily by a decrease in revenue from our wholesale business this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our nikeowned retail business driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales 

during fiscal 2010 the decrease in north america footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low singledigit percentage decrease in unit sales while average selling price per pair remained flat the decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our kids’ and running categories in the first half of fiscal 2010 

north america apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009 which was reflective of a high singledigit percentage increase in average selling price per unit offset by a low doubledigit percentage decrease in unit sales both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer closeout sales compared to the prior year 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in north america’s ebit was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year the improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from closeout to inline sales growth of our direct to consumer business as a percentage of total sales improved inline product margins and lower warehousing costs 

western europe 

 

   

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

on a currency neutral basis revenues for western europe increased 4 for fiscal 2011 attributable to growth in most territories revenues for the uk  ireland the largest market in western europe grew 5 for fiscal 2011 western europe’s direct to consumer revenues grew 10 which contributed approximately 1 percentage point to western europe’s revenue increase the growth in the direct to consumer business was fueled by 6 growth in comparable store sales 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates footwear revenue in western europe increased 7 driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our running football soccer and action sports categories which more than offset a slight revenue decline in our nike brand sportswear category 

on a currency neutral basis apparel revenue in western europe increased 2 primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our football soccer and running categories which more than offset a mid singledigit revenue decline in our nike brand sportswear category 

for fiscal 2011 the decrease in western europe’s ebit was driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage all of which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense the decline in the gross margin percentage was significantly impacted by the unfavorable yearoveryear standard currency rates also contributing to the decrease in the gross margin percentage was higher product input and air freight costs higher royalty expenses related to sales of endorsed team products and higher full price discounts these factors more than offset the favorable impact of fewer closeout sales 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

on a currency neutral basis most markets in western europe experienced lower revenues during fiscal 2010 reflecting a difficult retail environment throughout the geography our largest market the uk  ireland declined 4 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low singledigit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales the decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most nike brand product categories 

the yearoveryear decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high singledigit decline in unit sales combined with a mid singledigit decrease in average selling price the decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most nike brand product categories while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels 

for fiscal 2010 ebit for western europe declined at a faster rate than revenues as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage the increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 world cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in our direct to consumer operations and higher performancebased compensation the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher inline product margins a smaller proportion of closeout sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions 

  

central  eastern europe 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

led by russia and turkey most territories within central  eastern europe reported revenue growth during fiscal 2011 as economic conditions in the geography continued to show signs of recovery 

the growth in central  eastern europe’s footwear revenues was mainly driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our football soccer running and action sports categories while the growth in apparel revenues was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our running category 

for fiscal 2011 the decrease in central  eastern europe’s ebit was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation and a lower gross margin percentage which more than offset the increase in revenues and improved leverage on selling and administrative expense the decline in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to unfavorable yearoveryear standard currency rates higher air freight costs and an increase in product input costs 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

economic conditions in central  eastern europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 

the decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009 the decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels 

the yearoveryear decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a doubledigit decrease in average selling price and a mid singledigit decline in unit sales the decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories 

the yearoveryear decrease in central  eastern europe’s ebit during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense the decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates as well as higher discounts provided to customers the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in our direct to consumer operations 

  

greater china 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates greater china revenues increased 16 for fiscal 2011 driven by expansion in the number of partnerowned stores selling nike products as well as improvement in comparable store sales for partnerowned stores 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in greater china’s footwear revenue was primarily driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our running and nike brand sportswear categories while the growth in apparel revenue was mainly driven by doubledigit percentage increases in our nike brand sportswear basketball and men’s training categories 

for fiscal 2011 ebit for greater china grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of a higher gross margin percentage improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation the improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to higher product prices favorable product mix and lower inventory obsolescence expense which more than offset higher product input costs and warehousing costs from our new china distribution center 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 revenues for greater china were flat primarily attributable to comparisons against strong revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2009 driven by the beijing olympics greater china began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010 as revenues increased 11 as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009 

the increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid singledigit increase in average selling price partially offset by a mid singledigit decrease in unit sales the increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic price increases while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on inline products compared to the prior year 

the decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid singledigit decrease in unit sales across most major categories which more than offset a low singledigit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic price increases 

ebit for greater china increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the beijing olympics 

  

japan 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

macroeconomic conditions in japan remain difficult on march 11 2011 japan experienced a major earthquake and resulting tsunami while the company’s organization and assets in japan were not materially damaged business results for the month of march 2011 were significantly eroded by the natural disaster as we enter fiscal 2012 we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in japan to remain difficult as consumer confidence continues to recover 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates both footwear and apparel revenues in japan declined driven by decreases across most key categories partially offsetting the decreases was a doubledigit percentage growth in revenues from running apparel 

the decrease in japan’s ebit for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue partially offset by an improvement in the gross margin percentage the improvement in the gross margin percentage was primarily driven by favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates and positive impacts from fewer discounts on closeout sales which more than offset higher product input costs and inventory obsolescence expense 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates both footwear and apparel revenues in japan declined during fiscal 2010 due to decreases in unit sales across most major categories the decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in japan 

for fiscal 2010 the decrease in japan’s ebit was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense driven by increased investments in our direct to consumer operations which more than offset improved gross margins 

  

emerging markets 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for emerging markets increased 19 for fiscal 2011 most territories in the geography reported doubledigit revenue growth for the fiscal year led by brazil argentina mexico and korea 

for fiscal 2011 both footwear and apparel revenue growth in the emerging markets was primarily driven by strong demand in nearly all key categories most notably nike brand sportswear and running 

for fiscal 2011 ebit for emerging markets grew at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margin percentage improved leverage on selling and administrative expense and favorable foreign currency translation the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to a higher mix of inline product sales lower warehousing costs and favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates which more than offset the increase in product input costs and higher fullprice discounts 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates fiscal 2010 revenue growth for the emerging markets geography was driven by growth in all product categories and all territories most notably brazil mexico and korea 

footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a doubledigit growth in unit sales and a mid singledigit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010 reflective of strong demand for most nike brand product categories in all markets within the geography 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in emerging markets’ ebit was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage the decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities the decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates compared to the prior year which more than offset improved inline product margins 

  

global brand divisions 

 

 global brand divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead expenses that are centrally managed for the nike brand revenues for the global brand divisions are attributable to nike brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment 

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 the increase in global brand division expense was primarily due to an increase in both operating overhead and centrally managed demand creation expense the increase in operating overhead expense was mainly driven by increased investments in our direct to consumer infrastructure along with higher wages and travel expense the increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by a higher level of brand event spending around the world cup and world basketball festival in the first half of fiscal 2011 as well as increased investments in sports marketing 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in global brand division expense was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performancebased compensation which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues the increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs 

other businesses 

 

 fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

our other businesses are comprised of our affiliate brands cole haan converse hurley and umbro and nike golf the revenue growth at converse was primarily driven by increased licensing revenue in china as 

  

well as increased sales in the uk as we transitioned that market to a converse owned distribution model revenues for cole haan increased 12 driven by doubledigit percentage growth in our wholesale operations as well as high singledigit percentage growth in our direct to consumer operations revenues declined at nike golf where we experienced significant erosion in our japan business following the earthquake and tsunami in march 2011 

for fiscal 2011 ebit for our other businesses grew at a faster rate than revenues primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency exchange impacts the gross margin percentage remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011 as the favorable impact from improved product mix was offset by a lower mix of licensee revenues selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues remained relatively flat for fiscal 2011 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in other businesses’ revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at converse umbro and hurley which more than offset the declines at nike golf and cole haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets 

in fiscal 2009 ebit for our other businesses included a 401 million pretax noncash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill intangible and other assets of umbro excluding this impairment charge ebit for our other businesses would have increased 43 as a result of higher revenues improved gross margins across most businesses and lower demand creation spending 

for additional information about our impairment charges see note 4 — identifiable intangible assets goodwill and umbro impairment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

corporate 

 

 corporate consists largely of unallocated general and administrative expenses which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to our corporate headquarters unallocated insurance benefit and compensation programs including stockbased compensation certain foreign currency gains and losses including certain hedge gains and losses corporate eliminations and other items 

corporate revenues primarily consist of 1 foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments but managed through our central foreign exchange risk management program and 2 foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities which are used to record any nonfunctional currency revenues into the entity’s functional currency 

in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program other conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in nike brand geographic operating segments which are used to record any nonfunctional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency prior to fiscal 2010 all foreign currency results including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the western europe and central  eastern europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results 

  

fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 

for fiscal 2011 the decrease in corporate expense was primarily driven by yearoveryear net foreign currency gains generated by our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program also contributing to the decrease in corporate expense for fiscal 2011 was a 54 million yearoveryear reduction in stock options expense primarily due to a change in accelerated vesting provisions that took effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 and a lower estimated fair value for stock options granted in the current year these benefits more than offset an increase in corporate operating overhead expenses primarily driven by higher wagerelated expense 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2009 results for corporate included a pretax restructuring charge of 195 million excluding this restructuring charge loss before interest and taxes for corporate would have increased by 18 for fiscal 2010 primarily driven by an increase in performancebased compensation 

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the us in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions such as sales purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation into us dollars of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows our foreign currency exposures are due primarily to us dollar transactions at whollyowned foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in euros british pounds chinese renminbi and japanese yen 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows this also has the effect of delaying the majority of the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks that are material to nike inc on a consolidated basis we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and where practical by hedging a portion of certain remaining material exposures using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 

transactional exposures 

we transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary both of which subject us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 

  

  

   

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program as of may 31 2011 we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 15 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including nonfunctional currency revenues and expenses these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the fair value of these instruments at may 31 2011 and 2010 was 28 million and 206 million in assets and 136 million and 25 million in liabilities respectively the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income “oci” a component of shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings the ineffective portion is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income net ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended may 31 2011 2010 and 2009 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging in these cases the change in value of the instruments is immediately recognized in other income net and is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency asset or liability being hedged the fair value of these instruments at may 31 2011 and 2010 was 9 million and 104 million in assets and 17 million and 140 million in liabilities respectively 

refer to note 17 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 

translational exposures 

substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders’ equity in preparing our consolidated statements of income foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in translation a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit detriment of approximately 28 million and 16 million respectively for the year ended may 31 2011 and approximately 147 million and 33 million respectively for the year ended may 31 2010 

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts and options to partially or entirely hedge the variability of 

  

the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments this has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may 31 2011 was 1 million in assets and 21 million in liabilities at may 31 2010 the fair value was 78 million in assets the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other income net in the period during which the hedged availableforsale investment is sold and affects earnings any ineffective portion which was not material for any period presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income net 

we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related net gains included in other income net had net detriment benefit on our income before income taxes of approximately 33 million and 34 million for the years ended may 31 2011 and 2010 

refer to note 17 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings we hedge certain net investment positions in eurofunctional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion which was not material for any period presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income net to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci concurrent with settlement we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate the fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at may 31 2011 was 23 million in liabilities at may 31 2010 the fair value was 32 million in assets cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled 23 million and 5 million in the years ended may 31 2011 and 2010 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 18 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to 32 billion for fiscal 2010 our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2011 was net income of 21 billion our working capital was a net cash outflow of 708 million for fiscal 2011 as compared to a positive net cash inflow of 694 million for fiscal 2010 our investments in working capital increased primarily due to an increase in inventory and higher accounts receivable inventory at the end of fiscal 2011 increased 33 compared to fiscal 2010 primarily driven by a 15 increase in futures orders growth in replenishment programs for highturnover styles early purchases of key seasonal items with longer production lead times as well as the growth of direct to consumer operations changes in currency exchange rates and higher product costs also contributed to the increase in dollar inventory the increase in accounts receivable was mainly attributable to the increase in revenues during fiscal 2011 

cash used by investing activities was 10 billion during fiscal 2011 compared to 13 billion for fiscal 2010 the yearoveryear decrease was primarily due to lower net purchases of shortterm investments net purchases of shortterm investments were 537 million net of sales and maturities in fiscal 2011 compared to 937 million during fiscal 2010 

  

cash used by financing activities was 20 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to 11 billion used in fiscal 2010 the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid partially offset by an increase in notes payable 

in fiscal 2011 we purchased 238 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 19 billion these repurchases were made under the fouryear 5 billion program approved by our board of directors which commenced in december 2009 and as of the end of fiscal 2011 we have repurchased 304 million shares for 23 billion under this program we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2011 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

 

  

 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 

   

  

 the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 212 million excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2011 we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2011 please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2011 letters of credit of 99 million were outstanding generally for the purchase of inventory 

capital resources 

in december 2008 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which 760 million in debt securities may be issued as of may 31 2011 no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration 

as of and for the year ended may 31 2011 we had no amounts outstanding under our multiyear 1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks the facility matures in december 2012 based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate “libor” plus 015 the facility fee is 005 of the total commitment 

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2011 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

  

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program as of and for the year ended may 31 2011 no amounts were outstanding under this program we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

as of may 31 2011 we had cash cash equivalents and short term investments totaling 45 billion including amounts held in the us and foreign jurisdictions cash equivalents and short term investments consist primarily of deposits held at major banks money market funds tier1 commercial paper corporate notes us treasury obligations us government agency obligations and government sponsored enterprise obligations and other investment grade fixed income securities our fixed income investments are exposed to both credit and interest rate risk all of our investments are investment grade to minimize our credit risk while individual securities have varying durations the average duration of our entire cash equivalents and short term investment portfolio is less than 120 days as of may 31 2011 

despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to manage our worldwide cash and deploy funds to locations where it is needed we believe that existing cash cash equivalents shortterm investments and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our domestic and foreign capital needs in the foreseeable future 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements the guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value the valuation techniques and inputs used the activity in level 3 fair value measurements and the transfers between levels 1 2 and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy this guidance became effective for us beginning march 1 2010 except for disclosures relating to purchases sales issuances and settlements of level 3 assets and liabilities which will be effective for us beginning june 1 2011 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities “vie” this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie this guidance became effective for us beginning june 1 2010 the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

in june 2011 the fasb issued new guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this new guidance requires the components of net income and other comprehensive income to be either presented in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements this new guidance eliminates the current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of shareholders’ equity while the new guidance changes the presentation of comprehensive income there are no changes to the components that are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income under current accounting guidance this new guidance is effective for us beginning june 1 2012 as this guidance only amends the presentation of the components of comprehensive income the adoption will not have an impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations 

in april 2011 the fasb issued new guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between us gaap and international financial reporting standards this new guidance which is effective for us beginning june 1 2012 amends current us gaap fair value measurement and disclosure guidance to include increased transparency around valuation inputs and investment categorization we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting additionally these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration these new standards are effective for us beginning june 1 2011 we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

  

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level 

  

of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of 

  

the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain nonfunctional monetary assets and liabilities when the specific criteria to qualify for hedge accounting has been met changes in the fair value of contracts hedge probable forecasted future cash flows are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or if it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income net during the quarter in which such changes occur 

we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to the extent effective to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our 

  

common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs 

on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential 

  

actions of third party claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other income net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations primarily as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party and intercompany transactions we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 

when we begin hedging exposures the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros japanese yen and british pounds see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes 

  

and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 33 million and 17 million at may 31 2011 and 2010 respectively the var increased yearoveryear primarily as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2011 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 79 million and 52 million during fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above we therefore consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

  

details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may 31 2011 

 

 the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary

sales and marketing 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 19 of the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 88 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design production marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear apparel and equipment in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we initiated a reorganization of the nike brand into a new model consisting of six geographies effective june 1 2009 we began operating under our new organizational structure for the nike brand which consists of the following geographies north america western europe central and eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets previously nike brand operations were organized into the following four geographic regions us europe middle east and africa collectively “emea” asia pacific and americas 

united states market 

in fiscal 2010 and 2009 sales in the united states including us sales of our other businesses accounted for approximately 42 of total revenues compared to 43 in fiscal 2008 for fiscal 2010 and 2009 our other businesses were primarily comprised of cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro which was acquired on march 3 2008 for fiscal 2008 our other businesses were primarily comprised of cole haan converse exeter whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 hurley nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 nike golf and umbro we estimate that we sell to more than 23000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal 2010 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24 of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time 

  

period at a fixed price in fiscal 2010 and 2009 89 of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 90 in fiscal 2008 in fiscal 2010 62 of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 60 in fiscal 2009 and 62 in fiscal 2008 

we utilize 19 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 4 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 5 for skateboarding and outdoor products in addition we sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwnikestorecom  and we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

 

 nike’s three united states distribution centers for nike brand footwear are located in memphis tennessee nike brand apparel and equipment products are shipped from our memphis tennessee and foothill ranch california distribution centers cole haan products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire converse products are shipped primarily from ontario california and hurley products are distributed from irvine california 

international markets 

in fiscal 2010 and 2009 nonus sales including nonus sales of our other businesses accounted for 58 of total revenues compared to 57 in fiscal 2008 we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world we estimate that we sell to more than 24000 retail accounts outside the united states excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees we operate 14 distribution centers outside of the united states in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above during fiscal 2010 nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 8 of total nonus sales

significant customer 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales during fiscal 2010 

orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2010 were 88 billion compared to 78 billion for the same period last year this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these advancefutures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley umbro nike golf and certain retail sales across all brands 

product research and development 

we believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

manufacturing 

virtually all of our footwear is produced by factories we contract with outside of the united states in fiscal 2010 contract factories in vietnam china indonesia thailand and india manufactured approximately 37 34 23 2 and 1 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries the largest single footwear factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 5 of total fiscal 2010 footwear production 

almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 33 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china thailand indonesia malaysia vietnam sri lanka turkey cambodia el salvador mexico and taiwan the largest single apparel factory that we have contracted with accounted for approximately 7 of total fiscal 2010 apparel production the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning 

  

components during fiscal 2010 nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike and independent contractors in china and taiwan were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike’s contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2010 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 17 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2011 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring 

the current global economic recession has resulted in a significant slow down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts such actions if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

footwear imports into the european union 

in 2005 at the request of the european domestic footwear industry the european commission “ec” initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam together with other companies in our industry we took the position that special technology athletic footwear staf i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october 2006 on definitive duties of 165 for china and 10 for vietnam for nonstaf leather footwear but excluded staf from the final measures prior to the scheduled expiration in october 2008 of the measures imposed on the nonstaf footwear the domestic industry requested and the ec agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on nonstaf leather footwear in december 2009 following a review of the ongoing restrictions eu member states voted to extend the measures for an additional 15 months until march 31 2011 we expect that a decision by the ec on whether to initiate a review on these measures for a second time will take place before the end of calendar 2010 

  

on february 3 2010 the chinese government announced it would be seeking to refer the eu decision both on the original measures and subsequent review decision to the world trade organization “wto” and on may 18 2010 the dispute settlement body of the wto agreed to establish a panel to rule on china’s claims against the eu with respect to current antidumping measures in force for leather footwear exports 

footwear imports into brazil and argentina 

at the request of certain domestic footwear industry participants both brazil and argentina have initiated independent antidumping investigations against footwear made in china over the last two years we have been working in broad coalition with other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from china i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation in the case of argentina in 2010 the final determination made by the administering authorities was favorable to us in the case of brazil the administering authorities agreed to impose an antidumping duty against nearly all footwear from china which we believe will impact all brands in the footwear industry although we do not currently expect that this decision will materially affect us we are working with the same broad coalition of footwear companies to challenge this decision in domestic brazilian courts as well as international forums such as the wto 

footwear imports into turkey 

in 2006 turkey introduced safeguard measures in the form of additional duties on all imported footwear into turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until august 2009 in june 2009 turkish shoemanufacturers submitted and the turkish government agreed to review a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports despite the importers opposition to the continuation of the safeguard measures the turkish authorities extended these safeguard measures until august 2012 but reduced the duty from 3 per pair of footwear to 160 per pair of footwear as a result of this decision vietnam and indonesia each initiated discussions with turkey and each is seeking compensation from turkey which is possible under current wto rules these bilateral discussions are currently ongoing and one potential outcome could involve turkey awarding trade concessions on other products — or the exclusion from the safeguard measure of certain categories of footwear a conclusion of the first round of talks between the exporting countries is expected in september 2010 

trade relations with china 

china represents an important sourcing and marketing country for us many governments around the world are concerned about china’s growing and fastpaced economy compliance with wto rules currency valuation and high trade surpluses as a result a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns while some of these concerns may be justified we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors eg services manufacturing and agriculture to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers china’s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community we believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multinational companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures 

in the event any of these trade protection measures are implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

  

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

trademarks and patents 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign utility patents and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year will last from now to 2024 for design patents and from now to 2030 for utility patents we believe our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

we had approximately 34400 employees at may 31 2010 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees is represented by a union except for certain employees in the emerging markets geography where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union and in the united states where certain employees of cole haan are represented by a union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require representation for employees by works councils such as in certain countries in the european union in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or other employee representation by an organization similar to a union and in certain european countries we are required by local law to enter into andor comply with industry wide or national collective bargaining agreements there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

growth of the overall athletic footwear apparel and equipment markets intense competition among designers marketers distributors and sellers of athletic footwear apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers demographic changes changes in consumer preferences popularity of particular designs categories of products and sports seasonal and geographic demand for nike products difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences consumer demand for nike products and the various market factors described above difficulties in implementing operating and maintaining nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls including without limitation the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control interruptions in data and communications systems fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results including without limitation the fact that advance “futures” orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to changes in shipment timing and the changing mix of futures and atonce orders and order cancellations the ability of nike to sustain manage or forecast its growth and inventories the size timing and mix of purchases of nike’s products increases in the cost of materials and energy used to manufacture products new product development and introduction the ability to secure and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property performance and reliability of products customer service adverse publicity the loss of significant customers or suppliers dependence on distributors and licensees business disruptions increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings changes in business strategy or development plans general risks associated with doing business outside the united states including without limitation exchange rate fluctuations import duties tariffs quotas political and economic instability and terrorism changes in government regulations the impact of including business and legal developments relating to climate change liability and other claims asserted against nike the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports 

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for 

  

athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 

although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products technical innovation and quality control in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumers if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

failure of our contractors or our licensees’ contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we also have license agreements that permit unaffiliated parties to manufacture or contract to manufacture products using our trademarks we impose and require our licensees to impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers however from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law or our licensees may not require their contractors to comply with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

  

global capital and credit market conditions and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

continuing volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures higher unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending in the united states and internationally if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to 

  

fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period of time at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro and retail sales across all brands 

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business as a result retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

  

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in 

  

addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency climate change legislation or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion recently proposed legislation in the united states would change how us multinational corporations are taxed on their foreign income if such legislation is enacted it may have a material adverse impact to our tax rate and in turn our profitability 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increase our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our hedging activities see note 18 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are designed to minimize and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

  

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and longterm 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology in our supply chain and any failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and 

  

related processes in our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 74 of our class a common stock if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 14 of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that holders of class a common stock elect threefourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet analyst expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our class b common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts nikeowned retail including stores and ecommerce independent distributors franchisees and licensees worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences 

aside from achieving longterm revenue growth we continue to strive to deliver shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas 

 

  

  

  

  

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goals continue to be 

 

  

  

  

   

since the adoption of this longterm strategy in 2001 nike inc’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 8 and 14 respectively on an annual compounded basis during the same period our return on invested capital has increased from 14 to 21 while macroeconomic conditions in fiscal 2010 continued to remain challenging putting significant pressure on consumer spending in most markets worldwide we have continued to focus on achieving appropriate financial performance while extending our market leadership and positioning ourselves for sustainable profitable growth over the long term 

nike inc’s fiscal 2010 revenues declined 1 to 190 billion net income increased 28 to 19 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 386 a 27 increase versus fiscal 2009 our fiscal 2009 reported results contain significant noncomparable transactions including an aftertax charge of 145 million for restructuring activities recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and an aftertax charge of 241 million for the impairment of goodwill intangible and other assets of umbro which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 excluding these noncomparable items our fiscal 2010 net income would have increased 2 and diluted earnings per share would have increased 1 compared to fiscal 2009 see reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding noncomparable items below the increase in net income excluding noncomparable items was primarily driven by an improved gross margin percentage and a reduction in our effective tax rate which more than offset the reduction in revenues and higher selling and administrative expenses the increase in gross margin percentage was primarily the result of favorable product mix cost reduction initiatives lower input costs and sales growth in our nikeowned retail business our yearoveryear effective tax rate improvement was driven by continued benefit from our international businesses which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily attributable to an increase in performancebased compensation as well as investments in our nikeowned retail business which more than offset reductions in compensation expense resulting from restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 for fiscal 2010 diluted earnings per share grew at a slightly lower rate than net income given higher average outstanding shares in fiscal 2010 we increased cash flow from operations as a result of working capital reductions reflecting our efforts to aggressively manage inventory levels and accounts receivable collections at may 31 2010 our inventory and accounts receivable balances were down 13 and 8 respectively compared to may 31 2009 during fiscal 2010 we also returned larger amounts of cash to our shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases compared to fiscal 2009 

although most of our businesses reported revenue declines in the first half of fiscal 2010 the majority returned to growth in the second half of fiscal 2010 futures orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 7 as compared to the same periods in the prior year while we continue to believe that the company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by volatile macroeconomic conditions that may have an impact on our operations around the world these conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways including lower revenue from slowing consumercustomer demand for our products reduced profit margins andor increased costs changes in interest and currency exchange rates lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experienced by suppliers and customers our future performance is subject to our continued ability to take appropriate actions to respond to these conditions 

  

results of operations 

 

 reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding noncomparable items 1 

 

  

  

  

   

consolidated operating results 

revenues 

 

  

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates revenues for nike inc declined 2 driven primarily by a 2 decline in revenues for the nike brand all of our geographies delivered lower revenues with the exception of emerging markets reflecting a challenging economic environment across most markets most notably in our western europe and central and eastern europe geographies by product group revenues for our worldwide nike brand footwear business were down 1 compared to the prior year worldwide nike brand apparel and equipment revenues declined 5 and 7 respectively while our wholesale business remains the largest component of our nike brand revenues our nikeowned retail business continues to grow representing approximately 15 of our total nike brand revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to 13 in fiscal 2009 

revenues from our other businesses were comprised of results from cole haan converse inc hurley international llc nike golf and umbro ltd excluding the impact of currency changes revenues for these businesses increased by 4 for fiscal 2010 driven by increased revenues at converse umbro and hurley which more than offset revenue declines at nike golf and cole haan 

futures orders 

translated into us dollars at prior year exchange rates worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2010 were 10 higher than the orders reported for the comparable prior year period this futures growth was driven by increases in unit sales volume for our footwear products and growth in average unit price for both of our apparel and footwear products futures orders increased 7 when translated at forecasted exchange rates for the next six months which approximate current spot rates 

the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is due to yearoveryear changes in shipment timing and because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the schedule noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between advancefutures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel sales of nike equipment sales from our other businesses and certain retail sales across all brands 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates revenues for nike inc grew 4 driven primarily by a 4 increase in revenues for the nike brand the north america geography contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009 while the remaining geographies contributed 

  

over 2 percentage points during fiscal 2009 most of our geographies posted higher revenues by product group our worldwide nike brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6 and contributed 575 million of incremental revenue worldwide nike brand apparel revenues were in line with the prior year while equipment revenues declined 2 or 20 million 

our other businesses comprised of results from cole haan converse inc hurley international llc nike golf and umbro in fiscal 2009 constituted the remaining revenue in fiscal 2008 our other businesses also included exeter brands group whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 and nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 umbro was acquired on march 3 2008 revenues for these businesses were flat compared to fiscal 2008 

gross margin 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 our consolidated gross margin percentage was 140 basis points higher than the prior year the primary factors contributing to this improvement were as follows 

 

  

  

 together these factors increased consolidated gross margins by approximately 160 basis points for fiscal 2010 these increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable currency exchange rates primarily affecting our emerging markets and central and eastern europe geographies 

we anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2011 may be negatively impacted by macroeconomic factors including changes in currency exchange rates and rising costs for product input costs we also anticipate higher air freight costs as we work with our suppliers to meet increasing demand for certain running footwear products in the first half of the year 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which when combined decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points this decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year primarily in the western europe and central and eastern europe geographies gross pricing margins were lower primarily driven by higher product input costs most notably for footwear products higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels 

  

selling and administrative expense 

 

  

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense by 1 percentage point in fiscal 2010 

excluding changes in exchange rates operating overhead expense increased 4 compared to the prior year due primarily to increases in performancebased compensation and investments in nikeowned retail these increases were partially offset by reductions in compensation spending in fiscal 2010 as a result of restructuring activities that took place in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2010 changes in currency exchange rates had a minimal impact on demand creation expense demand creation expense remained flat compared to the prior year as increases in sports marketing and digital marketing expenses were offset by reductions in advertising 

in fiscal 2011 we will continue to focus our resources on those investments that drive sustainable and profitable growth we expect demand creation will increase at a slightly slower rate than revenues with spending weighted toward the first quarter driven by key events including the 2010 world cup we anticipate operating overhead will grow at a mid singledigit rate with faster growth in the first half of the fiscal year driven by increased investments in our nikeowned retail business 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009 excluding changes in exchange rates operating overhead increased 6 during fiscal 2009 the increase in operating overhead was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nikeowned retail in the north america western europe greater china and japan geographies infrastructure for the emerging markets and central and eastern europe geographies as well as for our nonnike brand businesses which more than offset steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings 

on a constantcurrency basis demand creation expense increased 3 during fiscal 2009 demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities most notably traditional media and print advertising the increase in demand creation during the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments including first quarter spending around the beijing summer olympics and the european football championships and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all geographies 

restructuring charges 

during fiscal 2009 we restructured the organization to streamline our management structure enhance consumer focus drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure as a result 

  

of these actions we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5 and incurred pretax restructuring charges of 195 million in fiscal 2009 primarily consisting of cash severance costs these charges are included in “corporate” for segment reporting purposes 

goodwill intangible and other asset impairment 

in fiscal 2009 we recognized a 401 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro’s goodwill intangible and other assets although umbro’s financial performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition this erosion was a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets particularly in the united kingdom and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business 

we measured the fair value of umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies we believe the use of both models compensated for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a standalone basis and this combination was indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation the fair value of umbro’s indefinitelived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark our assessments resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of 199 million and 181 million related to umbro’s goodwill and trademark respectively in fiscal 2009 in addition to the impairment analysis we determined an equity investment held by umbro was also impaired and recognized a charge of 21 million related to the impairment of that investment these charges are included in our “other businesses” category for segment reporting purposes 

for additional information about our impairment charges see note 4 — acquisition identifiable intangible assets goodwill and umbro impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

other income expense net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies the impact of certain foreign currency derivative instruments and unusual or nonrecurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business for fiscal 2010 other income expense net was primarily comprised of net foreign currency gains and the recognition of previously deferred licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of nike bauer hockey 

for fiscal 2010 we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains included in other income expense net increased our income before income taxes by approximately 34 million 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

for fiscal 2009 other income expense net was primarily comprised of 43 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of 24 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the 

  

nike bauer hockey business for fiscal 2008 other income expense net was primarily comprised of a 32 million gain on the sale of nike bauer hockey and a 29 million gain on the sale of the starter brand business as well as foreign currency conversion losses of 77 million 

for fiscal 2009 we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains and losses included in other income expense net increased our income before income taxes by approximately 124 million 

income taxes 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20 basis points higher than the effective rate for fiscal 2009 our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 includes a tax benefit related to charges recorded for the impairment of umbro’s goodwill intangible and other assets excluding this tax benefit our effective rate for fiscal 2009 would have been 265 230 basis points higher than our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 the decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to the continued benefit from our international operations where tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate 

we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2011 will be in line with our fiscal 2010 effective tax rate 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill intangible and other assets of umbro which had a favorable impact of 250 basis points profits earned outside of the us the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a onetime tax benefit of 105 million which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate 

operating segments 

as part of the restructuring initiative that took place in fiscal 2009 the company changed the geographic structure of nike brand to six geographies to streamline its management structure enhance consumer focus drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure effective june 1 2009 the company’s new reportable operating segments for the nike brand became north america western europe central and eastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets previously nike brand operations were organized into four regions us europe middle east and africa collectively “emea” asia pacific and americas 

as part of our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program standard foreign currency rates are assigned to each nike brand entity in our geographic operating segments and are used to record any nonfunctional currency revenues or product purchases into the entity’s functional currency geographic operating segment revenues and cost of sales reflect use of these standard rates for all nike brand operating segments differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in corporate together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the centrally managed foreign 

  

exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses in fiscal 2009 and 2008 foreign currency hedge results along with other conversion gains and losses generated by the western europe and central and eastern europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographies 

the breakdown of revenues follows 

 

  

  

  

 effective june 1 2009 the primary financial measure we use to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes commonly referred to as “ebit” which represents net income before interest expense income net and income taxes in the consolidated statements of income previously we evaluated the performance of individual operating segments based on income before income taxes financial information has been reclassified to conform to the new primary financial measure we use as discussed in note 19 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements certain corporate costs are not included in ebit of our operating segments 

  

the breakdown of earnings before interest and taxes is as follows 

 

  

 north america 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for north america declined 1 driven primarily by a decrease in revenue from our wholesale business this decrease was partially offset by an increase in our nikeowned retail business driven primarily by an increase in comparable store sales on a currency neutral basis futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 7 higher compared to the same period in the prior year 

during fiscal 2010 the decrease in north america footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a low singledigit percentage decrease in unit sales while average selling price per pair remained flat the decline in unit sales was primarily driven by lower sales for our kids’ and running products in the first half of fiscal 2010 

  

north america apparel revenue during fiscal 2010 was flat when compared to fiscal 2009 which was reflective of a high singledigit percentage increase in average selling price per unit offset by a low doubledigit percentage decrease in unit sales both the increase in average selling price per unit and the decrease in unit sales were primarily a result of fewer closeout sales compared to the prior year 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in north america’s ebit was primarily the result of improved gross margins combined with a slight decrease in selling and administrative expense driven by a reduction in demand creation expense compared to prior year the improvement in gross margin was mainly attributable to a shift in mix from closeout to inline sales growth of nikeowned retail as a percentage of total sales improved inline product margins and lower warehousing costs the reduction in demand creation expense was primarily attributable to lower spending on advertising 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 the increase in north america footwear revenue was the result of low singledigit growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our jordan brand action sports and kids’ products the increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009 and increased sales mix of higher priced jordan brand products partially offset by increased sales mix of kids’ products which are generally lower priced 

the yearoveryear decrease in north america apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a mid singledigit decrease in unit sales primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers mostly offset by an increased mix of closeout sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels 

ebit for the north america geography declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expense and lower gross margins the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in nikeowned retail gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels 

western europe 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

on a currency neutral basis most markets in western europe experienced lower revenues during fiscal 2010 including our largest market uk  ireland declined by 4 reflecting a difficult retail environment 

  

throughout the geography excluding changes in currency exchange rates futures orders scheduled for delivery during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 11 higher compared to the same period in the prior year driven by strong growth across most markets and product categories 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates the decrease in footwear revenue during fiscal 2010 was primarily the result of low singledigit decreases in both average selling price and unit sales the decrease in average selling price was attributable to higher customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels while the reduction in unit sales was due to lower sales for most nike brand product categories 

the yearoveryear decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a high singledigit decline in unit sales combined with a mid singledigit decrease in average selling price the decrease in unit sales was due to lower sales for most nike brand product categories while the decrease in average selling price was a result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels 

for fiscal 2010 ebit for western europe declined at a faster rate than revenues as the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues more than offset the improvements in gross margin percentage the increase in selling administrative expense was primarily driven by a higher level of both demand creation spending around the 2010 world cup and operating overhead expense as a result of investments in nikeowned retail and higher performancebased compensation the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was primarily attributable to higher inline product margins a smaller proportion of closeout sales and reduced inventory obsolescence expense as a result of our leaner inventory positions 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates a number of markets within the geography experienced lower revenues reflecting a more difficult retail environment revenues for the southern european markets including spain italy and france declined while the uk  ireland remained flat compared to the same period in the prior year 

the increase in footwear revenue was attributable to a low singledigit growth in unit sales the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for kids and nike brand sportswear products average selling price per pair remained flat compared to the prior year 

the decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of closeout sales and higher levels of discounts provided to retailers to manage inventory levels which more than offset a lowsingledigit increase in unit sales 

the yearoveryear increase in ebit for the western europe geography during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved yearoveryear standard currency rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on inline products the increase in selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was mainly driven by retail expansion across the geography 

  

central and eastern europe 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

economic conditions in central and eastern europe remained difficult as most markets within the geography experienced lower revenues in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 we are beginning to see signs of stabilization in these markets as a result of improving macroeconomic conditions increasing brand momentum and tight management of inventory on a currencyneutral basis future orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 3 higher compared to the same period in the prior year 

the decrease in footwear revenue was due to a decline in average selling price while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2009 the decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels 

the yearoveryear decrease in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a doubledigit decrease in average selling price and a mid singledigit decline in unit sales the decline in average selling price was primarily the result of higher discounts provided to retailers to manage their inventory levels while the decline in unit sales was due to lower sales in most key product categories 

the yearoveryear decrease in central and eastern europe’s ebit during fiscal 2010 was the result of lower revenues a decline in gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expense the decline in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates as well as higher discounts provided to customers the increase in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in the reserve for bad debts along with increased investments in nikeowned retail 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

on a currency neutral basis revenue for the central and eastern europe geography grew by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009 driven by stronger results in russia 

the increase in footwear revenue was primarily attributable to a doubledigit growth in unit sales the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for nike brand sportswear kids and running products 

the increase in apparel revenues was primarily driven by a double digit percentage increase in unit sales partially offset by a midsingle digit decrease in average selling price resulting from a higher mix of closeout sales 

  

the yearoveryear increase in ebit for central and eastern europe during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved inline product margins which more than offset higher discounts on inline products and warehousing costs 

greater china 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 revenues for greater china were flat primarily attributable to comparisons against strong revenue growth in the first half of fiscal 2009 driven by the beijing olympics greater china began to gain momentum in the second half of fiscal 2010 as revenues increased 11 as compared to the second half of fiscal 2009 on a currencyneutral basis futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16 higher compared to the same period in the prior year 

the increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a mid singledigit increase in average selling price partially offset by a mid singledigit decrease in unit sales the increase in average selling price was primarily due to strategic product pricing increases while the decrease in unit sales was primarily driven by lower discounts on inline products compared to the prior year 

the decrease in apparel revenue for fiscal 2010 was primarily due to a mid singledigit decrease in unit sales across most major categories which more than offset a low singledigit increase in average selling price primarily driven by strategic product pricing increases 

ebit for greater china increased at a faster rate than revenue as a result of higher gross margins and reductions in demand creation spending attributable to comparisons against higher prior year spending around the beijing olympics 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

greater china continued to deliver strong results in fiscal 2009 as revenues increased 21 on a currencyneutral basis driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling nike products and sales through existing stores china’s rate of revenue growth slowed to 6 on a currency neutral basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 

the increase in both footwear and apparel revenues was driven primarily by a doubledigit increase in unit sales the growth in unit sales was partially offset by a reduction in average selling price in fiscal 2009 resulting primarily from increased discounts on inline products provided to retailers to manage inventory levels 

  

the increase in ebit for greater china for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues which more than offset higher selling and administrative expense selling and administrative expense increased but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009 the increase in selling and administrative expense during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion and spending around brand events 

japan 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates both footwear and apparel revenues in japan declined during fiscal 2010 due to decreases in unit sales across most major categories the decline in revenues was reflective of a difficult and highly promotional marketplace in japan as we enter fiscal 2011 we anticipate macroeconomic conditions in japan to remain difficult on a currencyneutral basis futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 were 16 lower compared to the same period in the prior year 

for fiscal 2010 the decrease in japan’s ebit was primarily due to lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense driven by increased investments in nikeowned retail which more than offset improved gross margins 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

for fiscal 2009 the increase in japan’s footwear revenue was driven primarily by a midsingle digit increase in unit sales partially offset by a reduction in average selling price the slight increase in apparel revenue was primarily driven by a lowsingle digit increase in average selling price while unit sales remained flat compared to fiscal 2008 

the increase in ebit for fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue compared to fiscal 2008 

  

emerging markets 

 

 fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

excluding changes in currency exchange rates all markets in the emerging markets geography reported revenue growth for fiscal 2010 most notably brazil mexico and korea driven by sales growth in all product categories futures orders scheduled to be delivered during the first six months of fiscal 2011 increased 30 on a currency neutral basis 

footwear revenue growth was primarily driven by a doubledigit growth in unit sales and a mid singledigit increase in average selling price per pair during fiscal 2010 reflective of strong demand for most nike brand product categories in all markets within the geography 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in emerging markets’ ebit was primarily the result of revenue growth combined with lower selling and administrative expense which more than offset a decrease in gross margin percentage the decrease in selling and administrative expense was primarily due to lower operating overhead expense resulting from fiscal 2009 restructuring activities the decline in gross margin was primarily due to less favorable yearoveryear standard currency rates assigned to the geography which more than offset improved inline product margins 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates most markets in the emerging markets geography reported revenue growth in fiscal 2009 led by brazil argentina and mexico 

the increase in footwear revenue was primarily driven by a doubledigit increase in unit sales partially offset by a lowsingle digit reduction in average selling price 

the increase in ebit for fiscal 2009 was primarily the result of revenue growth and lower selling and administrative expense the decrease in selling and administrative expense was mainly driven by a reduction in spending around advertising and sports marketing 

  

global brand divisions 

 

 global brand divisions primarily represent nike brand licensing businesses that are not part of a geographic operating segment and selling general and administrative expenses that are centrally managed for the nike brand 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

for fiscal 2010 the increase in global brand division’s loss before interest and taxes was largely due to increases in centrally managed demand creation expense and performancebased compensation which more than offset an increase in licensing revenues the increase in demand creation expense was primarily driven by the centralization of certain marketing production costs 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

the increase in global brand division’s loss before interest and taxes was mainly attributable to a decrease in licensing revenues and an increase in selling and administrative expense driven by higher operating overhead and increased demand creation spending 

other businesses 

 

   

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

our other businesses are comprised of cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro for fiscal 2010 the increase in other businesses’ revenue was primarily driven by revenue growth at converse umbro and hurley which more than offset the declines at nike golf and cole haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets 

in fiscal 2009 ebit for our other businesses included a 401 million pretax noncash charge relating to the impairment of goodwill intangible and other assets of umbro excluding this impairment charge ebit for our other businesses would have increased 43 as a result of higher revenues improved gross margins across most businesses and lower demand creation spending 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

for fiscal 2009 our other businesses were comprised of cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro for fiscal 2008 our other businesses primarily included cole haan converse exeter whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 hurley nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 nike golf and umbro which was acquired on march 3 2008 

excluding the loss of revenue from nike bauer hockey and the starter brand business and the addition of umbro other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 6 driven by the strong performance from converse and hurley offset by sales decreases at nike golf and cole haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets 

ebit for other businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a 401 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro’s goodwill intangible and other assets excluding the impairment charge the loss of income from nike bauer hockey and the starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of umbro earnings before interest and taxes for other businesses would have decreased by 28 driven by declines in operating results at nike golf and cole haan 

for additional information about our impairment charges see note 4 — acquisition identifiable intangible assets goodwill and umbro impairment in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

corporate 

 

 fiscal 2010 corporate revenues primarily consist of foreign currency revenuerelated hedge gains and losses generated by entities within the nike brand geographic operating segments through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to these entities which are used to record any nonfunctional currency revenues into the entity’s functional currency 

corporate’s loss before interest and taxes consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to the company’s corporate headquarters unallocated insurance and benefit programs certain foreign currency gains and losses including certain hedge gains and losses corporate eliminations and other items in addition to the foreign currency gains and losses recognized in corporate revenues foreign currency results include all other foreign currency hedge results generated through our centrally managed foreign exchange risk management 

  

program other conversion gains and losses arising from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in non functional currencies and gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to each entity in nike brand geographic operating segments which are used to record any nonfunctional currency product purchases into the entity’s functional currency prior to fiscal 2010 all foreign currency results including hedge results and other conversion gains and losses generated by the western europe and central and eastern europe geographies were recorded in their respective geographic results 

fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009 

in fiscal 2009 results for corporate included a pretax restructuring charge of 195 million excluding this restructuring charge loss before interest and taxes for corporate would have increased by 18 primarily driven by an increase in performancebased compensation 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

the increase in corporate’s loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pretax restructuring charges of 195 million consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs 

in fiscal 2009 foreign currency conversion gains losses reported in corporate expense totaled 46 million compared to 76 million in fiscal 2008 which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008 

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the us we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates in the normal course of business foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions such as sales purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars for consolidated reporting our primary foreign currency exposures are related to us dollar transactions at whollyowned foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in euros british pounds chinese renminbi and japanese yen 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to manage those risks that are material to nike inc on a consolidated basis we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and by hedging remaining material exposures where practical using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options the company’s hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

transactional exposures 

we transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary which subjects us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 

   

  

  

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program as of may 31 2010 we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 18 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including nonfunctional currency revenues and expenses these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the fair value of these instruments at may 31 2010 and 2009 was 206 million and 248 million in assets and 25 million and 12 million in liabilities respectively the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income “oci” a component of shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings the ineffective portion was a gain of 5 million for the year ended may 31 2010 the ineffective portion was immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net ineffectiveness was not material for the years ended may 31 2010 2009 and 2008 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging in these cases the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related nonfunctional currency asset or liability the fair value of these instruments at may 31 2010 and 2009 was 104 million and 13 million in assets and 140 million and 34 million in liabilities respectively the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings the impact of such instruments is included in other income expense net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged 

refer to note 18 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 

translational exposures 

substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders’ equity in preparing our consolidated statements of income foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in translation a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and income before income taxes was a net translation benefit detriment of approximately 147 million and 33 million respectively for the year ended may 31 2010 and approximately 199 million and 4 million respectively for the year ended may 31 2009 

  

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging we utilize forward contracts and options to partially or entirely hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments this has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may 31 2010 and 2009 was 78 million and 104 million in assets respectively there were no instruments in a liability position at may 31 2010 or 2009 the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other income expense net in the period during which the hedged availableforsale investment is sold and affects earnings any ineffective portion which was not material for any period presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net 

we estimate that the combination of translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses and the yearoveryear change in foreign currency related gains included in other income expense net had a favorable impact of approximately 34 million and 124 million on our income before income taxes for fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively 

refer to note 18 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings during fiscal 2008 we began to hedge certain net investment positions in eurofunctional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings in accordance with the accounting standards for derivatives and hedging the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion which was not material for any period presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci concurrent with settlement we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate the fair value of outstanding net investment hedges at may 31 2010 and 2009 were 32 million in assets and 23 million in liabilities respectively cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled 5 million and 191 million in the years ended may 31 2010 and 2009 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 32 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to 17 billion for fiscal 2009 our primary source of operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 was net income of 19 billion as well as positive cash flows from working capital our working capital provided a net positive cash flow of 07 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to a net cash outflow of 04 billion for fiscal 2009 the increase in cash flows from working capital 

  

was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities driven by timing of fourth quarter expenses a decrease in accounts receivable as a result of a shorter collection cycle and slightly lower revenues and a decrease in inventories reflective of tighter inventory buys compared to fiscal 2009 

cash used by investing activities was 13 billion during fiscal 2010 compared to 08 billion for fiscal 2009 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to net purchases of shortterm investments of 09 billion net of sales and maturities in fiscal 2010 compared to 05 billion in net purchases of shortterm investments during fiscal 2009 also contributing to the yearoveryear increase in cash used by investing activities in fiscal 2010 was a reduction in proceeds for the settlement of net investment hedges compared to the prior year period these increases were partially offset by a reduction in cash used for purchases of property plant and equipment 

cash used by financing activities was 11 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to 07 billion used in fiscal 2009 the increase in cash used by financing activities was primarily due to an increase in payments of notes payable and longterm debt as well as an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid partially offset by an increase in proceeds from exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2010 we purchased 113 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 754 million during fiscal 2010 we concluded our previous fouryear 3 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in june 2006 during this program we repurchased a total of 539 million shares having completed the program during the third quarter of fiscal 2010 we began repurchases under the fouryear 5 billion program approved by our board of directors in september 2008 of the total 11 million shares repurchased during fiscal 2010 66 million shares were repurchased under this program for 454 million we continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items where we are acting as the guarantor currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2010 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

 

  

   

 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 

  

 the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 282 million excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2010 we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2010 please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2010 letters of credit of 101 million were outstanding generally for the purchase of inventory 

capital resources 

in december 2008 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which 760 million in debt securities may be issued as of may 31 2010 no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration we may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs 

as of may 31 2010 we had no amounts outstanding under our multiyear 1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks the facility matures in december 2012 based on our current longterm 

  

senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate “libor” plus 015 the facility fee is 005 of the total commitment 

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2010 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program as of may 31 2010 no amounts were outstanding under this program we may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2011 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs future volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets we believe that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in january 2010 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements the guidance requires additional disclosures about the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value the valuation techniques and inputs used the activity in level 3 fair value measurements and the transfers between levels 1 2 and 3 of the fair value measurement hierarchy this guidance became effective for us beginning march 1 2010 except for disclosures relating to purchases sales issuances and settlements of level 3 assets and liabilities which will be effective for us beginning june 1 2011 as this guidance only requires expanded disclosures the adoption did not and will not impact our consolidated financial position or results of operations see note 6 — fair value measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for disclosures required under this guidance 

in february 2010 the fasb issued amended guidance on subsequent events under this amended guidance sec filers are no longer required to disclose the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated in originally issued and revised financial statements this guidance was effective immediately and we adopted these new requirements since the third quarter of fiscal 2010

recently issued accounting standards 

in october 2009 the fasb issued new standards that revised the guidance for revenue recognition with multiple deliverables these new standards impact the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multipleelement arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting additionally these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration these new standards are effective for us beginning june 1 2011 we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial positions or results of operations 

in june 2009 the fasb issued a new accounting standard that revised the guidance for the consolidation of variable interest entities “vie” this new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie and requires an ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie this guidance is effective for us beginning june 1 2010 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard 

  

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns discounts and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns discounts and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns discounts and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict 

  

future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in 

  

which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as certain resulting receivable or payable balances when specific criteria for hedge accounting have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into 

  

net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward and option contracts amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decline below hedged levels or when it is not probable that a forecasted transaction will occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional twomonth period of time thereafter we are required to reclassify the ineffective portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation related to our net investment in those subsidiaries when appropriately designated as a hedge the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 

stockbased compensation 

we account for stockbased compensation by estimating the fair value of stockbased compensation on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

  

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other income expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash 

  

flows this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party and intercompany transactions we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation adjustments related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 

when we begin hedging exposures the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within 12 to 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than 12 months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros japanese yen and british pounds see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 17 million and 68 million at may 31 2010 and 2009 respectively the var decreased yearoveryear as a result of reduced total notional value of our foreign 

  

currency derivative portfolio combined with decreased foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2010 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 52 million and 207 million during fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above we therefore consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may 31 2010 

 

 the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt instruments were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly translation of these instruments which varies due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary

sales and marketing 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements on page 85 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk 

we report our nike brand operations based on our internal geographic organization each nike brand geography operates predominantly in one industry the design production marketing and selling of sports and fitness footwear apparel and equipment the geographic organization consists of the following four regions us europe middle east and africa collectively “emea” asia pacific and americas as previously announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we initiated a reorganization of the nike brand into a new model consisting of six geographies as a result of the reorganization beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 our new organizational structure will consist of the following geographies north america western europe centraleastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets 

united states market 

in fiscal 2009 sales in the united states including us sales of our other businesses accounted for approximately 42 of total revenues compared to 43 in fiscal 2008 and 47 in fiscal 2007 for fiscal 2009 our other businesses were primarily comprised of cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro which was acquired on march 3 2008 for fiscal 2008 and 2007 our other businesses were primarily comprised of cole haan converse exeter whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 hurley nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 nike golf and umbro we estimate that we sell to more than 23000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal 2009 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 25 of sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time 

  

period at a fixed price in fiscal 2009 89 of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 90 in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2009 60 of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding our other businesses were made under the futures program compared to 62 in fiscal 2008 and 65 in fiscal 2007 

we utilize 20 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 5 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 3 for skateboarding and outdoor products in addition we sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwnikestorecom  and we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

 

 nike’s three united states distribution centers for footwear are located in memphis tennessee apparel and equipment products are shipped from our memphis tennessee and foothill ranch california distribution centers cole haan products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire converse products are shipped primarily from ontario california and hurley products are distributed from irvine california 

international markets 

in fiscal 2009 nonus sales including nonus sales of our other businesses accounted for 58 of total revenues compared to 57 in fiscal 2008 and 53 in fiscal 2007 we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world we estimate that we sell to more than 28000 retail accounts outside the united states excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees we operate 14 distribution centers outside of the united states in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 11 of total nonus sales 

we operate the following retail outlets outside the united states

significant customer 

no customer accounted for 10 or more of our net sales during fiscal 2009 

orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2009 were 78 billion compared to 88 billion for the same period last year this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders and the fulfillment of certain of these advancefutures orders may fall outside of the scheduled time period noted above in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley umbro nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

product research and development 

we believe our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics chemistry exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes athletes engaged under sports marketing contracts and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

manufacturing 

virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2009 contract suppliers in china vietnam indonesia and thailand manufactured 36 36 22 and 6 of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india and mexico to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries our largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 5 of total fiscal 2009 footwear production 

almost all of nike brand apparel is manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 34 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china thailand indonesia malaysia vietnam turkey sri lanka cambodia taiwan el salvador mexico india and israel our largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 5 of total fiscal 2009 apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components during fiscal 2009 nike ihm inc and nike suzhou sports company ltd both 

  

whollyowned subsidiaries of nike and independent contractors in china and taiwan were our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike’s contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2009 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada chile brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 16 of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states emea and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be shortterm in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire in 2011 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export and import duties antidumping measures quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring 

the global economic crisis has resulted in a significant slow down in international trade and a sharp rise in protectionist actions around the world these trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors and the footwear and apparel industries as a whole are not immune companies in our industry are facing trade protectionist challenges in many different regions and in nearly all cases we are working together to address trade issues to reduce the impact to the industry while observing applicable competition laws notwithstanding our efforts such actions if implemented could result in increases in the cost of our products which could adversely affect our sales or profitability and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

footwear imports into the european union 

in 2005 at the request of the european domestic footwear industry the european commission “ec” initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam together with other companies in our industry we took the position that special technology athletic footwear staf i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october 2006 on definitive duties of 165 for china and 10 for vietnam for nonstaf leather footwear but excluded staf from the final measures prior to the scheduled expiration in october 2008 of the measures imposed on the nonstaf footwear the domestic industry requested and the ec agreed to review a petition to extend these restrictions on nonstaf leather footwear we are working in broad coalition with other companies in our industry to challenge this request for extension and we expect a decision by the end of calendar year 2009 or early 2010 

footwear imports into brazil and argentina 

at the request of certain domestic footwear industries both brazil and argentina have initiated independent antidumping investigations against footwear made in china we are working in broad coalition with other companies in our industry to challenge these cases on the basis that the athletic footwear being imported from 

  

china i should not be within the scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation we anticipate final decisions in both cases will be made in late 2009 

footwear imports into turkey 

in 2006 turkey introduced a safeguard measure on all imported footwear into turkey with the goal of protecting its local shoe manufacturing industry until august 2009 in june 2009 turkish shoemanufacturers submitted and the turkish government agreed to review a request for extension of the safeguard measures claiming that the rehabilitation process of the local turkish industry was interrupted due to the continuing increase of footwear imports we are working in broad coalition with other companies in our industry to oppose the continuation of these safeguard measures we anticipate a final decision in this review will be made in early fall 2009 

trade relations with china 

china represents an important sourcing and marketing country for us many governments around the world are concerned about china’s growing and fastpaced economy compliance with world trade organization rules currency valuation and high trade surpluses as a result a wide range of legislative proposals have been introduced to address these concerns while some of these concerns may be justified we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors eg services manufacturing and agriculture to help ensure any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii reflects and considers china’s domestic economy and the important role it has in the global economic community we believe other companies in our industry as well as most other multinational companies are in a similar position regarding these trade measures 

in the event any of these trade protection measures were implemented we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could abate any such disruption and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

  

trademarks and patents 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign utility patents and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year will have a remaining duration of from now to 2023 for design patents and from now to 2029 for utility patents we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

we had approximately 34300 employees at may 31 2009 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees is represented by a union except for certain employees in the americas region where local law requires those employees to be represented by a trade union also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require representation for employees by works councils such as in the european union in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or other representation by an organization similar to a union although collective bargaining agreements are not involved there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible 

  

for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

investors should also be aware that while nike does from time to time communicate with securities analysts it is against nike’s policy to disclose to them any material nonpublic information or other confidential commercial information accordingly shareholders should not assume that nike agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report furthermore nike has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others thus to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections forecasts or opinions such reports are not the responsibility of nike 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with a significant number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including expenditures for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 

although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products technical innovation and quality control in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test 

  

cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products the consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes sports teams and leagues to evaluate promote and establish product authenticity with consumers if certain endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

failure of our contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture our products and we impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers however from time to time contractors may not comply with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

global capital and credit market conditions and resulting declines in consumer confidence and spending could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

volatility and disruption in the global capital and credit markets in 2008 and 2009 have led to a tightening of business credit and liquidity a contraction of consumer credit business failures higher unemployment and declines in consumer confidence and spending in the united states and internationally if global economic and financial market conditions deteriorate or remain weak for an extended period of time the following factors could have a material adverse effect on our business operating results and financial condition 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

  

  

 our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set period at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro and retail sales across all brands 

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk we may be unable to sell 

  

excess products ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply products we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which have had an adverse effect on our business as a result retailers may be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition product sales are dependent in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in lower sales and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these retailers have in the past increased their market share and may continue to do so in the future by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk with a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 150 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products the actions we take to establish and protect 

  

trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

from time to time we are called upon to defend ourselves against lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

changes in tax laws and unanticipated tax liabilities could adversely affect our effective income tax rate and profitability 

we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world and any repatriation of nonus earnings for which we have not previously provided for us taxes we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provision which is subject to significant discretion recently the obama administration proposed legislation that would change how us multinational corporations are taxed on their foreign income if such legislation is enacted it may have a material adverse impact to our tax rate and in turn our profitability 

  

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our hedging activities s ee note 18 risk management and derivatives on the accompanying note to the consolidated financial statement which are designed to minimize and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations may not sufficiently mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to minimize volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with consolidating or transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

  

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology in our supply chain and any failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including product design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations and could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business the failure of any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individual could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

  

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 96 of our class a common stock if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 19 of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact holders of class a common stock shares elect threefourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet analyst expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts nikeowned retail including stores and ecommerce independent distributors franchisees and licensees worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to achieve longterm revenue growth by creating innovative “must have” products building deep personal consumer connections with our brands and delivering compelling retail presentation and experiences 

we strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas 

 

  

  

  

  

 through execution of this strategy our longterm financial goal is to achieve 

 

  

  

  

   

since the adoption of this longterm strategy in 2001 on an annual compounded basis nike inc’s revenues and earnings per share have grown 9 and 14 respectively during the same period our return on invested capital increased from 14 to 18 in fiscal 2009 deteriorating macroeconomic conditions caused significant volatility in global financial markets and put significant pressure on discretionary consumer spending worldwide nike’s fiscal 2009 revenues grew 3 to 192 billion net income decreased 21 to 15 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 303 a 19 decrease versus fiscal 2008 our fiscal 2009 reported results also contain significant noncomparable transactions including aftertax charges of 1445 million for our restructuring activities which were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2407 million for the impairment of goodwill intangible and other assets of umbro which was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 our fiscal 2008 reported results include combined gains from the sale of our starter brand and nike bauer hockey businesses of 354 million net of tax and a onetime tax benefit of 1054 million excluding these noncomparable items net income would have increased 7 to 19 billion and diluted earnings per share would have increased 10 to 381 compared to fiscal 2008 see reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding noncomparable items below the increase in our net income excluding noncomparable items was higher than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal 2009 due primarily to an increase in other income expense net which included foreign currency conversion gains of 434 million compared to foreign currency conversion losses of 766 million in fiscal 2008 and the recognition of licensing income of 240 million related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the nike bauer hockey business excluding noncomparable items our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program in the first half of fiscal 2009 our cash flows from operations and return on invested capital both declined as compared to fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 we took steps we believe prudent and necessary to identify and manage potential exposures and to position ourselves for sustainable profitable longterm growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we executed a plan of restructuring the organization to streamline our management structure enhance consumer focus drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure as a result of these actions we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5 and incurred pretax restructuring charges of 195 million primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs as part of this restructuring plan we also initiated a reorganization of the nike brand business into a new operating model consisting of six geographies as a result of the reorganization beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 our new organizational structure will consist of the following geographies north america western europe centraleastern europe greater china japan and emerging markets 

other steps taken in fiscal 2009 included reductions in planned selling and administrative expenses including the implementation of a hiring freeze reductions in planned spending for travel meetings and demand creation as well as tighter inventory purchasing and working capital management we also placed increased focus on monitoring the financial health of suppliers and customers and continued to take proactive measures to consolidate production with our strongest most efficient and innovative manufacturing contractors to ensure we maintain a healthy production base for the present and the future these capacity consolidation actions could result in additional costs associated with production and logistics as well as supply chain disruptions in the first half of fiscal year 2010 as we transition production between manufacturing contractors however we do not believe these potential additional costs will have a material impact on our operating results 

we continue to believe that the company is well positioned from a business and financial perspective but we are not immune to the current challenging global economic conditions these conditions could continue to affect our business in a number of direct and indirect ways including lower revenue from slowing consumercustomer demand for our products reduced profit margins andor increased costs changes in interest and currency exchange rates lack of credit availability and business disruptions due to difficulties experiences by suppliers and customers our future performance is subject to the inherent uncertainty presented by the evolving macroeconomic conditions and our continued actions to respond to these conditions

 consolidated operating results 

revenues 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased revenues by 1 percentage point the us region contributed nearly 1 percentage point of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009 excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates our international regions contributed over 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2009 as all of our international regions posted higher revenues on a currency neutral basis by product group our worldwide nike brand footwear business reported revenue growth of 6 and contributed 575 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2009 worldwide nike branded apparel revenues were in line with the prior year while equipment revenues declined 2 or 20 million 

our other businesses comprised primarily of results from cole haan converse inc hurley international llc nike golf and umbro in fiscal 2009 constituted the remaining revenue in fiscal 2008 our other businesses also included exeter brands group whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 and nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 umbro was acquired on march 3 2008 revenues for these businesses declined 1 or 17 million 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

during fiscal 2008 changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth strong demand for nike brand products continued to drive revenue growth as all four of our geographic regions and on a consolidated basis all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth the us region contributed nearly 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008 excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates our international regions contributed nearly 7 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008 as all of our international regions posted higher revenues our other businesses contributed the remaining consolidated constantcurrency revenue growth as cole haan converse hurley and nike golf posted higher yearoveryear revenues 

  

by product group worldwide nike brand footwear revenue grew 14 and contributed more than 12 billion of incremental revenue for fiscal 2008 worldwide nike branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 14 and 6 for the year respectively and combined added approximately 750 million of incremental revenue in fiscal 2008 our other businesses reported revenue growth of 17 and combined added more than 360 million of incremental revenue 

gross margin 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decline in consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were lower gross pricing margins and increased discounts which when combined decreased consolidated gross margins by approximately 60 basis points this decrease was partially offset by improved hedge rates relative to the prior year primarily in the europe middle east and africa “emea” region gross pricing margins were lower primarily driven by higher product input costs most notably for footwear products higher levels of discounts were provided across all businesses in fiscal 2009 to manage inventory levels 

we anticipate our gross margins in fiscal 2010 will be negatively impacted by hedge rates that are unfavorable in comparison to the prior year 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

during fiscal 2008 the primary factors contributing to the 110 basis point increase in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year included higher footwear inline gross pricing margins most notably in the us region primarily due to strategic price increases improved currency hedge rates relative to the prior year primarily in the emea region and higher footwear closeout net pricing margins most notably in the emea region primarily due to better inventory management the factors driving an increased gross margin percentage were partially offset by lower apparel inline gross pricing margins primarily driven by higher product costs most notably in the us and emea regions and increased apparel closeout sales primarily in the us region 

selling and administrative expense 

 

  

   

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

changes in foreign currency exchange rates decreased selling and administrative expense by 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009 excluding changes in exchange rates operating overhead increased 6 during fiscal 2009 the increase in operating overhead in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nikeowned retail in the us emea and asia pacific regions infrastructure for emerging markets in the emea and asia pacific regions and nonnike brand businesses which more than offset the steps taken to reduce operating overhead spending including implementation of a hiring freeze and reductions in spending for travel and meetings 

on a constantcurrency basis demand creation expense increased 3 during fiscal 2009 demand creation spending decreased in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of actions taken to reduce spending across nearly all demand creation related activities most notably traditional media and print advertising the increase in demand creation the first half of fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to strategic investments in demand creation including first quarter spending around the beijing summer olympics and the european football championships and increased investments in athlete and team endorsements across all regions 

in fiscal 2010 we intend to reduce selling and administrative spending while shifting resources to fund initiatives that are critical to the achievement of our longterm growth goals we expect our selling and administrative expenses to decline in the first half of fiscal 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year reflecting both lower operating overhead and demand creation spending with the latter driven partially by the comparison to the significant prior year demand creation investment around the beijing summer olympics and european football championships future selling and administrative expense may vary from our current expectations due to changes in the rapidly evolving macroeconomic environment and our reaction to those changes 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

in fiscal 2008 selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by 4 percentage points 

on a constantcurrency basis demand creation expense increased 15 versus the prior year the yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products spending around major sporting events including the european football championships and the beijing summer olympics key product initiatives such as men’s training in the us and retail presentation 

excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates operating overhead increased 14 versus the prior year the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nikeowned retail nonnike brand businesses emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performancebased compensation 

restructuring charges 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 we executed a plan to restructure the organization to streamline our management structure enhance consumer focus drive innovation more quickly to market and establish a more scalable cost structure as a result of these actions we reduced our global workforce by approximately 5 and incurred pretax restructuring charges of 195 million primarily consisting of cash charges related to severance costs these charges are included in our “corporate” category for segment reporting purposes 

goodwill intangible and other asset impairment 

in the third quarter of fiscal 2009 we recognized a 4013 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro’s goodwill intangible and other assets although umbro’s financial 

  

performance for fiscal 2009 was slightly better than we had originally expected projected future cash flows had fallen below the levels we expected at the time of acquisition this erosion is a result of both the unprecedented decline in global consumer markets particularly in the united kingdom and our decision to adjust the level of investment in the business 

we measured the fair value of umbro by using an equal weighting of the fair value implied by a discounted cash flow analysis and by comparisons with the market values of similar publicly traded companies we believe the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risk associated with either model if used on a standalone basis and this combination is indicative of the factors a market participant would consider when performing a similar valuation the fair value of umbro’s indefinitelived trademark was estimated using the relief from royalty method which assumes that the trademark has value to the extent that umbro is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from the trademark our assessments have resulted in the recognition of impairment charges of 1993 million and 1813 million related to umbro’s goodwill and trademark respectively in fiscal 2009 in addition to the impairment analysis we determined an equity investment held by umbro was impaired and recognized a charge of 207 million related to the impairment of this investment these charges are included in our “other” category for segment reporting purposes 

for additional information about our impairment charges see note 4 — acquisition identifiable intangible assets goodwill and umbro impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

other income expense net 

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

for fiscal 2009 other income expense net was a gain of 885 million compared to a loss of 79 million in fiscal 2008 other income expense net is primarily comprised of foreign currency conversion gains and losses from the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities in nonfunctional currencies and results of foreign currency derivative instruments as well as disposals of fixed assets and other unusual or nonrecurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business for fiscal 2009 other income expense net was primarily comprised of 434 million of foreign currency conversion gains and the recognition of 240 million of licensing income related to our fiscal 2008 sale of the nike bauer hockey business for fiscal 2008 other income expense net was primarily comprised of a 320 million gain on the sale of nike bauer hockey and a 286 million gain on the sale of the starter brand business as well as foreign currency conversion losses of 766 million 

foreign currency conversion gains and losses reported in other income expense net with the exception of gains and losses generated by the emea region and other businesses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note 19 — operating segments and related information 

for fiscal 2009 we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other income expense net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a yearoveryear increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 124 million 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

for fiscal 2008 other income expense net was a loss of 79 million compared to a gain of 09 million in fiscal 2007 in fiscal 2008 other income expense net included foreign currency conversion losses that were partially offset by the 320 million gain on the sale of nike bauer hockey and the 286 million gain on the sale of the starter brand business other income expense net in fiscal 2007 is primarily comprised of the 147 million gain on the saleleaseback of our oregon footwear distribution center and the 142 million benefit from the settlement of the converse arbitration partially offset by foreign currency conversion losses 

  

in fiscal 2008 we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency conversion losses included in other income expense net resulted in a yearoveryear increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 122 million 

income taxes 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was 80 basis points lower than the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 due primarily to the tax benefit related to the impairment of goodwill intangible and other assets of umbro that had a favorable impact of 250 basis points profits earned outside of the us the impact of the resolution of foreign audit items and the retroactive reinstatement of the research and development tax credit also favorably impacted our fiscal 2009 effective tax rate reflected in the effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was a onetime tax benefit of 1054 million which had a favorable impact of 420 basis points on our effective tax rate we estimate that our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2010 will be approximately 255 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 248 740 basis points lower than the prior year over the last few years several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits as the realization of those benefits was uncertain in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we took steps necessary to realize these benefits resulting in a onetime tax benefit of 1054 million also reflected in the yearoveryear effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the united states our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate 

futures orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2009 declined 12 compared to orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2009 this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 7 percentage points to this reported futures decline versus the same period in the prior year excluding this currency impact lower apparel orders drove most of the decline in overall futures and advance orders 

the reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders and that the fulfillment of certain orders may fall outside of the scheduled noted above in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley umbro nike golf and retail sales across all brands

 the breakdown of income before income taxes “pretax income” follows 

 

  

 the following discussion includes disclosure of pretax income for our operating segments we have reported pretax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” as discussed in note 19 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements certain corporate costs are not included in pretax income of our operating segments 

us region 

 

   

fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

during fiscal 2009 the increase in us footwear revenue was the result of lowsingle digit growth in both unit sales and average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was primarily driven by higher demand for our jordan brand action sports and kids’ products the increase in average selling price per pair was attributable to selective price increases primarily during the first half of fiscal 2009 and increased sales mix of higher priced jordan brand products partially offset by increased sales mix of kids’ products which are lower priced 

the yearoveryear decrease in us apparel revenues during fiscal 2009 reflected a midsingle digit decrease in unit sales primarily driven by a reduction in products sold to value channel retailers and generally softer demand in the overall apparel market average selling prices increased slightly as a result of the reduction in products sold to value retailers mostly offset by an increased mix of closeout sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels 

pretax income for the us region declined in fiscal 2009 as a result of higher operating overhead expenses and lower gross margins the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in nikeowned retail gross margins decreased as a result of higher warehousing costs higher retail inventory markdowns and increased customer discounts provided to manage inventory levels 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

during fiscal 2008 the increase in us footwear revenue was the result of lowsingle digit growth in unit sales and a slight increase in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales and average selling price per pair was driven by higher demand for our nike brand sportswear products and jordan brand products partially offset by a decrease in demand for our nike brand basketball products the increase in average selling price per pair was also attributable to strategic price increases and an increased sales mix of higher priced nike brand sportswear and jordan brand products 

the yearoveryear increase in us apparel revenues during fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in unit sales mostly offset by lower average selling prices the increase in unit sales was primarily driven by higher closeout sales and increased demand for nike brand sports performance products partially offset by lower unit sales of sportswear and jordan brand products average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of a higher mix of closeout sales 

the yearoveryear decrease in us equipment revenues during fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit sales of accessory products and fewer closeout sales 

pretax income for the us region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses partially offset by higher gross margins driven by footwear the increase in demand creation was driven by higher sports marketing expenses and investments in the retail presentation of our key wholesale customers the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in nikeowned retail and normal wage inflation 

  

emea region 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2 percentage points in fiscal 2009 excluding changes in currency exchange rates a number of markets within the region experienced lower revenues reflecting a more difficult retail environment in these markets the uk remained flat for fiscal 2009 while the emerging markets in the region grew 14 driven by stronger results in russia during the first half of fiscal 2009 these results were offset by lower revenues in southern european markets including spain italy and france 

excluding changes in exchange rates footwear revenues increased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2009 the increase in footwear revenue was attributable to mid singledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a low singledigit decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for nike brand sportswear and kids’ products the decrease in average selling price per pair was mainly attributable to higher customer discounts and a shift in product mix to lower priced product models most notably higher volume of kids’ products 

on a currency neutral basis emea apparel revenue decreased 4 percentage points during fiscal 2009 primarily driven by lower average selling prices resulting from a higher mix of closeout sales and higher levels of discounts provided retailers to manage inventory levels which more than offset a mid singledigit increase in unit sales 

the yearoveryear increase in pretax income for the emea region during fiscal 2009 was primarily driven by a higher gross margin percentage partially offset by slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to improved yearoveryear currency hedge rates which more than offset higher warehousing costs and discounts on inline products the increase in selling and administrative expenses was mainly driven by retail expansion across the region 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 11 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2008 nearly all markets within the region increased revenues during the year the emerging markets in the region grew nearly 25 driven by strong results in russia turkey and south africa increases in northern europe and the uk also contributed significantly to the revenue growth 

excluding changes in exchange rates footwear revenues increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year the increase in footwear revenue was attributable to doubledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a low singledigit decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our nike brand soccer and sportswear products the decrease in 

  

average selling price per pair resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product models most notably within our nike brand sportswear product lines 

on a currency neutral basis emea apparel revenue increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased unit sales and a slight increase in average selling prices the increase in unit sales was driven primarily by increased demand for sports performance products most notably soccer 

the increase in pretax income for the emea region during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues favorable foreign currency translation and a higher gross margin percentage partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to improved yearoveryear hedge rates and improved margins on closeout product the increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in demand creation spending primarily attributable to spending around the european football championships as a result of retail expansion and overall business growth across the region operating overhead expenses increased for the year but at a slower rate than revenue growth 

asia pacific region 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2009 excluding changes in currency exchange rates all countries across the region delivered revenue growth china continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2009 revenues increased 22 on a currencyneutral basis driven by expansion in both the number of stores selling nike products and sales through existing stores china’s rate of revenue growth slowed to 6 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 as we lapped very strong growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 on a currency neutral basis revenues in japan were up 1 compared to fiscal 2008 

footwear and apparel revenue growth for fiscal 2009 were driven primarily by an increase in unit sales most notably in china the growth in unit sales was slightly offset by a lowsingle digit reduction in average selling prices in fiscal 2009 resulting primarily from increased discounts on inline products provided retailers to manage inventory levels 

the increase in pretax income for the asia pacific region for fiscal 2009 was driven by higher revenues and improved gross margins which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses gross margins improved versus the prior year primarily driven by improved yearoveryear standard foreign currency rates and reduced warehousing costs which more than offset increased product discounts selling and administrative expenses increased but represented a lower percentage of revenues in fiscal 2009 versus fiscal 2008 the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2009 was primarily due to retail and infrastructure expansion primarily in china and spending around brand events 

  

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008 nearly all countries across the region delivered revenue growth on a currency neutral basis china continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2008 revenues increased 50 on a currencyneutral basis driven by the expansion in both the number of stores selling nike products and sales through existing stores constantcurrency revenues in japan increased 2 during fiscal 2008 

footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2008 reflected increased unit sales most notably in china partially offset by lower average selling prices driven primarily by a shift in mix from higher priced to lower priced models the yearoveryear increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased demand in china 

the increase in pretax income for the asia pacific region for fiscal 2008 was driven by higher revenues improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation which more than offset slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue the gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by reduced warehousing costs improved yearoveryear standard currency rates and improved margins on closeout product the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to spending around the beijing summer olympics overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion primarily in china also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses which grew slightly slower than revenues 

americas region 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

in the americas region changes in currency exchange rates negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 9 percentage points in fiscal 2009 excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates the americas region reported growth in all markets led by brazil argentina and mexico 

the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to higher revenues and selling and administrative expense leverage which more than offset lower gross margins selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2008 but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2009 the increase in selling and administrative expense was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead expenses mainly driven by spending around retail marketing programs brand events and normal wage inflation the slight decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 was mainly due to a higher sales mix of lower margin footwear products and higher import costs which more than offset improved yearonyear standard foreign currency rates 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

in the americas region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 7 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008 excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates the americas region reported growth in all markets led by argentina mexico and brazil 

  

the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2008 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues improved gross margins and operating overhead leverage combined with favorable foreign currency translation these factors were partially offset by higher demand creation spending as a percentage of revenue the gross margin improvement was driven primarily by higher inline net pricing margins resulting from a better mix of products sold and fewer discounts offered in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in demand creation spending during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to investments in sports marketing most notably in soccer brand events and investments in our retail presentation 

other businesses 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

for fiscal 2009 our other businesses were primarily comprised of cole haan converse hurley nike golf and umbro for fiscal 2008 our other businesses were primarily comprised of cole haan converse exeter whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 hurley nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 nike golf and umbro which was acquired on march 3 2008 

the slight decrease in other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from nike bauer hockey and the starter brand business excluding the loss of revenue from nike bauer hockey and the starter brand business and the addition of umbro other businesses revenues for fiscal 2009 would have increased 5 driven by the strong performance from converse and hurley offset by sales decreases at nike golf and cole haan due to reductions in consumer discretionary spending in their respective markets 

pretax income for other businesses declined for fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a 4013 million pretax noncash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of umbro’s goodwill intangible and other assets excluding the impairment charge the loss of income from nike bauer hockey and the starter brand business along with the dilutive impact of umbro pretax income for other businesses would have decreased by 28 driven by declines in operating results at nike golf and cole haan 

for additional information about our impairment charges see note 4 — acquisition identifiable intangible assets goodwill and umbro impairment in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

  

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

the increase in other business revenues was driven by higher revenues across most businesses most notably converse and nike golf the increase in converse and nike golf is mainly driven by strong consumer demand both in the united states and international markets the growth at cole haan is mainly driven by the strong results at companyowned retail stores 

during fiscal 2008 growth at converse and nike golf combined with margin improvements across most businesses drove the yearoveryear increase in pretax income fiscal 2007 pretax income included a 142 million benefit relating to the settlement of an arbitration ruling involving converse and a former south american licensee fiscal 2008 pretax income for our other businesses would have increased approximately 18 versus fiscal 2007 excluding this favorable settlement 

on march 3 2008 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the outstanding shares of umbro a united kingdombased global soccer brand for a purchase price of £2905 million in cash approximately 5764 million inclusive of direct transaction costs this acquisition was intended to strengthen our market position in the united kingdom and expand nike’s global leadership in soccer a key area of growth for the company this acquisition also provides positions in emerging soccer markets such as china russia and brazil the results of umbro’s operations have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements and in the “other” operating segment since the date of acquisition umbro which was listed on the london stock exchange prior to our acquisition reported in their 2006 annual report that revenues for calendar year 2006 were approximately 276 million £1495 million and estimated that the combination of umbro’s calendar year 2006 wholesale revenue and estimated sales revenue earned by umbro’s licensees from the sale of umbro products totaled approximately 755 million £4094 million 

following a strategic review of the company’s existing business portfolio we concluded that the starter and nike bauer hockey businesses did not align with our longterm growth priorities on december 17 2007 we completed the sale of the starter brand business for 60 million in cash on april 17 2008 we completed the sale of the nike bauer hockey business for net proceeds of 1892 million after working capital adjustments these transactions resulted in gains of approximately 286 million and 320 million respectively which are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note 19 — operating segments and related information 

corporate expense 

 

 fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 

corporate expense consists of unallocated general and administrative expenses which includes expenses associated with centrally managed departments depreciation and amortization related to the company’s corporate headquarters unallocated insurance and benefit programs foreign currency gains and losses including hedge gains and losses corporate eliminations and other items 

the increase in corporate expense in fiscal 2009 was primarily attributable to pretax restructuring charges of 195 million consisting primarily of cash charges related to severance costs 

  

foreign currency gains and losses include conversion gains and losses generated by our centrally managed foreign currency hedging program and other conversion gains and losses foreign currency gains and losses also include gains and losses resulting from the difference between actual foreign currency rates and standard rates assigned to our regions with the exception of foreign currency gains and losses generated by the emea region and other businesses which are reported within their respective operating results substantially all of the company’s remaining conversion gains and losses as well as standard to actual foreign currency gains and losses reside at corporate in fiscal 2009 foreign currency conversion gains losses reported in corporate expense totaled 459 million compared to 763 million in fiscal 2008 which was primarily driven by a net gain from currency hedges in fiscal 2009 versus a net hedge loss in fiscal 2008 

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

the increase in corporate expense from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by increased employee compensation expense due to the increase in centralized corporate functions higher performancebased compensation as well as increased investments in demand creation including other spending around the beijing summer olympics 

in fiscal 2008 foreign currency conversion loss reported in corporate expense totaled 763 million compared to 317 million in fiscal 2007 which was primarily driven by a larger net loss from currency hedges in fiscal 2008 versus 2007 

foreign currency exposures and hedging practices 

overview 

as a global company with significant operations outside the us in the normal course of business we are exposed to risk arising from changes in currency exchange rates foreign currency fluctuations affect the recording of transactions such as sales purchases and intercompany transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denominated results of operations financial position and cash flows into us dollars for consolidated reporting our primary foreign currency exposures are related to us dollar transactions at whollyowned foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and translation of results denominated in the euro british pound chinese renminbi and japanese yen 

our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our reported consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons we manage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to manage those risks that are material to nike inc on a consolidated basis we manage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations that exist within the portfolio and by hedging remaining material exposures where practical using derivative instruments such as forward contracts and options the company’s hedging policies are designed to partially or entirely offset changes in the underlying exposures being hedged we account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” as issued and amended “fas 133” we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes 

transactional exposures 

we transact business in various currencies and have significant revenues and costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary which subjects us to foreign currency risk our most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are 

 

   

  

  

  

 managing transactional exposures 

transactional exposures are managed on a portfolio basis within our foreign currency risk management program we use currency forward contracts and options with maturities up to 23 months to hedge the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on probable forecasted future cash flows including nonfunctional currency revenues and expenses these are accounted for as cash flow hedges in accordance with fas 133 the fair value of these instruments at may 31 2009 and 2008 was 2480 million and 953 million in assets and 122 million and 1498 million in liabilities respectively the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in other comprehensive income “oci” a component of shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same financial statement line item and in the same period or periods during which the related hedged transactions affect earnings the ineffective portion which was not material for any year presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net 

certain currency forward contracts used to manage foreign exchange exposure of nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities subject to remeasurement are not designated as hedges under fas 133 in these cases the change in value of the instruments is intended to offset the foreign currency impact of the remeasurement of the related asset or liability the fair value of these instruments at may 31 2009 and 2008 was 132 million and 342 million in assets and 343 million and 73 million in liabilities respectively the change in value of these instruments is immediately recognized in earnings the impact of such instruments is included in other income expense net and aims to offset foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of the exposures being hedged 

refer to note 18 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 

translational exposures 

substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the us dollar fluctuations in currency exchange rates create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate the balance sheets and operational results of these foreign currency denominated subsidiaries into us dollars for consolidated reporting the translation of foreign subsidiaries nonus dollar balance sheets into us dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment to oci within shareholders’ equity in preparing our consolidated statements of income foreign exchange rate fluctuations impact our operating results as the revenues and expenses of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in translation a weaker us dollar in relation to foreign functional currencies benefits our consolidated earnings whereas a stronger us dollar reduces our consolidated earnings the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on the translation of our consolidated revenues and pretax income was a net translation benefit detriment of 1994 million and 40 million respectively for the twelve months ended may 31 2009 

  

managing translational exposures 

to minimize the impact of translating foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses into us dollars for consolidated reporting certain foreign subsidiaries use excess cash to purchase us dollar denominated availableforsale investments the variable future cash flows associated with the purchase and subsequent sale of these us dollar denominated securities at nonus dollar functional currency subsidiaries creates a foreign currency exposure that qualifies for hedge accounting under fas 133 we utilize forward contracts and options to partially or entirely hedge the variability of the forecasted future purchases and sales of these us dollar investments this has the effect of partially offsetting the yearoveryear foreign currency translation impact on net earnings in the period the investments are sold hedges of availableforsale investments are accounted for as cash flow hedges the fair value of instruments used in this manner at may 31 2009 and 2008 was 1036 million and 78 million in assets and 0 and 144 million in liabilities respectively the effective portion of the changes in fair value of these instruments is reported in oci and reclassified into earnings in other income expense net in the period during which the hedged availableforsale investment is sold and affects earnings any ineffective portion which was not material for any year presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net 

for fiscal 2009 we estimate that the combination of foreign currency conversion gains in other income expense net and the modestly favorable translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from our international businesses resulted in a yearoveryear increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 124 million 

refer to note 18 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional quantitative detail 

net investments in foreign subsidiaries 

we are also exposed to the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on our investments in whollyowned foreign subsidiaries denominated in a currency other than the us dollar which could adversely impact the us dollar value of these investments and therefore the value of future repatriated earnings during fiscal 2008 we began to hedge certain net investment positions in eurofunctional currency foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on net investments with the effect of preserving the value of future repatriated earnings in accordance with fas 133 the effective portion of the change in fair value of the forward contracts designated as net investment hedges is recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income any ineffective portion which was not material for any year presented is immediately recognized in earnings as a component of other income expense net to minimize credit risk we have structured these net investment hedges to be generally less than six months in duration upon maturity the hedges are settled based on the current fair value of the forward contracts with the realized gain or loss remaining in oci concurrent with settlement we enter into new forward contracts at the current market rate the impact of net investment hedges reflected in oci was a pretax gain loss of 1614 million and 686 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively cash flows from net investment hedge settlements totaled 1913 million and 760 million in 2009 and 2008 respectively 

liquidity and capital resources 

cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 17 billion for fiscal 2009 compared to 19 billion for fiscal 2008 this decrease was mainly due to an increase in cash used for our working capital as a result of lower accounts payable and a higher accounts receivable balance the decrease in accounts payable was primarily due to lower purchases of inventory as well as a reduction in overall spending the higher accounts receivable balance is a result of a longer collection cycle reflecting a more challenging retail environment experienced by our customers in the emea and us regions 

  

cash used by investing activities was 08 billion during fiscal 2009 compared to 05 billion in fiscal 2008 the yearoveryear increase was primarily due to a net increase in shortterm investments purchased in fiscal 2009 the increase in net purchases of shortterm investments in fiscal 2009 was partially offset by proceeds from settlement of net investment hedges of 1913 million during the second half of fiscal 2008 we began to use net investment hedges to mitigate the risk of variability in foreigncurrencydenominated net investments in certain whollyowned international subsidiaries 

cash used in financing activities was 07 billion during fiscal 2009 compared to 12 billion in fiscal 2008 the decrease in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchases to preserve liquidity given the current financial market conditions 

in fiscal 2009 we purchased approximately 106 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 6390 million as of the end of fiscal 2009 we have repurchased 492 million shares for 27 billion under the 3 billion program approved by our board of directors in june 2006 in september 2008 our board of directors approved a new 5 billion share repurchase program the new program will commence upon completion of our current 3 billion share repurchase program we expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2009 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

 

  

 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike product for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts generally do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of 

  

product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 

  

 the total liability for uncertain tax positions was 2739 million excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2009 we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2009 please refer to the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements note 7 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2009 letters of credit of 1548 million were outstanding generally for the purchase of inventory 

capital resources 

in december 2008 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission under which 760 million in debt securities may be issued as of may 31 2009 no debt securities had been issued under this shelf registration we may issue debt securities under the shelf registration in fiscal 2010 depending on general corporate needs 

as of may 31 2009 we had no amounts outstanding under our multiyear 1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks the facility matures in december 2012 based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate “libor” plus 015 the facility fee is 005 of the total commitment 

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the 

  

event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2009 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our 1 billion commercial paper program as of may 31 2009 100 million was outstanding under this program at a weighted average interest rate of 040 this borrowing was repaid subsequent to may 31 2009 we may issue commercial paper from time to time during fiscal 2010 depending on general corporate needs we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

despite recent uncertainties in the financial markets to date we have not experienced difficulty accessing the credit markets or incurred higher interest costs continuing volatility in the capital markets however may increase costs associated with issuing commercial paper or other debt instruments or affect our ability to access those markets notwithstanding these adverse market conditions we believe that current cash and shortterm investment balances and cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

recently adopted accounting standards 

on december 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities — an amendment of fasb statement no 133” “fas 161” which provides revised guidance for enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments how derivative instruments and the related hedged items are accounted for under fas 133 and how derivative instruments and the related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the adoption of fas 161 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations for additional information see note 18 — risk management and derivatives in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 

on june 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas 157” for financial assets and liabilities which clarifies the meaning of fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined under fas 157 as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the assets or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date subsequent changes in fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings or other comprehensive income when they occur the effective date of the provisions of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis was deferred by fasb staff position fas 1572 “fsp fas 1572” and is effective for the fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 the adoption of fas 157 for financial assets and liabilities did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations the adoption of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations see note 6 — fair value measurements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

also effective june 1 2008 we adopted sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities” “fas 159” which allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for certain financial assets and liabilities on a contractbycontract basis as of may 31 2009 we have not elected the fair value option for any additional financial assets and liabilities beyond those already prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 

in october 2008 the fasb issued staff position no fas 1573 “determining the fair value of a financial asset in a market that is not active” “fsp fas 1573” fsp fas 1573 clarifies the application of fas 157 in a market that is not active and defines additional key criteria in determining the fair value of a 

  

financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active fsp fas 1573 applies to financial assets within the scope of accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements in accordance with fas 157 fsp fas 1573 was effective upon issuance and the application of fsp fas 1573 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

recently issued accounting standards 

in may 2009 the fasb issued sfas no 165 “subsequent events” “fas 165” which establishes general standards of accounting and disclosure for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued the provisions of fas 165 are effective for the quarter ending august 31 2009 we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in april 2009 the fasb issued staff position no fas 1071 and apb 281 “interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” “fsp fas 1071 and apb 281” which amends sfas no 107 “disclosures about fair value of financial instruments” and apb opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments in interim and annual reporting periods the provisions of fsp fas 1071 and apb 281 are effective for the quarter ending august 31 2009 we do not expect the adoption will have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “fas 141r” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “fas 160” these standards aim to improve simplify and converge international standards of accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements the provisions of fas 141r are effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after june 1 2009 generally the effects of fas 141r will depend on future acquisitions the provisions of fas no 160 are effective for the company beginning june 1 2009 we do not expect that the adoption of fas 160 will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in april 2008 the fasb issued staff position no fas 1423 “determination of the useful life of intangible assets” “fsp fas 1423” fsp fas 1423 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” the intent of the position is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under fas 141r and other us generally accepted accounting principles the provisions of fsp fas 1423 are effective for the fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 we do not expect the adoption of fsp fas 1423 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect 

  

working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to 

  

cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment and definitelived assets 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software are recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and are depreciated over the estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

we review the carrying value of longlived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset among others if such facts indicate a potential impairment we would assess the recoverability of an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group if the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value 

  

goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” we perform annual impairment tests on goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an intangible asset with an indefinite life below its carrying value events or changes in circumstances that may trigger interim impairment reviews include significant changes in business climate operating results planned investments in the reporting unit or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable among other factors the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis in step two of the analysis we measure and record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise 

we generally base our measurement of the fair value of a reporting unit on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach the discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting unit to generate in the future our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include our weighted average cost of capital longterm rate of growth and profitability of the reporting unit’s business and working capital effects the market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the reporting unit to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business significant estimates in the market valuation approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size growth profitability risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit 

we believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and the market valuation approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within our industry and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a standalone basis 

indefinitelived intangible assets primarily consist of acquired trade names and trademarks in measuring the fair value for these intangible assets we utilize the relieffromroyalty method this method assumes that trade names and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them this method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted “fas 133” have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by fas 133 we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which such changes 

  

occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries when appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with fas 133 the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 

as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness in accordance with fas 133 we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 

stockbased compensation 

as of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” under the provisions of fas 123r the fair value of stockbased compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” “fas 109” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset which increases our income tax expense in the period when such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the 

  

actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other income expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 item 7a   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign exchange risk management program is intended to minimize both the positive or negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations financial position and cash flows this also has the effect of delaying the impact of current market rates on our consolidated financial statements dependent upon hedge horizons we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain 

  

anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party and intercompany transactions we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 

when we begin hedging exposures the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months although at may 31 2009 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 23 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our european subsidiaries when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euro japanese yen and british pound see section “foreign currency exposures and hedging practices” under item 7 for additional detail 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive derivative financial instruments derived using the var model was 678 million and 349 million at may 31 2009 and may 31 2008 respectively the var increased despite a reduction in the total notional value of our foreign currency derivative instruments as a result of increased foreign currency volatilities at may 31 2009 as compared to 

  

may 31 2008 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 2074 million and 323 million during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 respectively 

the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps intercompany loans and related interest amounts are eliminated in consolidation furthermore our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans are substantially hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts which are included in the var calculation above we therefore consider the interest rate and foreign currency market risks associated with our nonfunctional currency intercompany loans to be immaterial to our consolidated financial position results from operations and cash flows 

details of third party debt and interest rate swaps are provided in the table below the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may 31 2009 

 

 the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary 

in fiscal 2003 we entered into a receivefloating payfixed interest rate swap related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries this interest rate swap was not designated as a hedge instrument under fas 133 accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap were recorded to consolidated net income each period the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may 31 2009 2008 and 2007 both the intercompany loan and the related interest rate swap matured during fiscal 2009

our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing of high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail including stores and internet sales and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees in over 180 countries around the world virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad 

products 

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovation in products designed for men women and children running training basketball soccer sportinspired urban shoes and children’s shoes are currently our topselling footwear categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future we also market shoes designed for aquatic activities baseball bicycling cheerleading football golf lacrosse outdoor activities skateboarding tennis volleyball walking wrestling and other athletic and recreational uses

sales and marketing 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements on page 75 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability this is a continuing risk 

united states market 

in fiscal 2008 sales in the united states including us sales of cole haan converse exeter brands group which we sold in december 2007 hurley umbro nike bauer hockey which we sold in april 2008 and nike golf accounted for approximately 43 percent of total revenues compared to 47 percent in fiscal 2007 and 47 percent in fiscal 2006 we estimate that we sell to more than 25000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2008 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 24 percent of nike brand sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal year 2008 86 percent of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike golf umbro and nike bauer hockey were made under the futures program compared to 94 percent in fiscal 2007 and 90 percent in fiscal 2006 in fiscal 2008 62 percent of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike golf umbro and nike bauer hockey were made under the futures program compared to 65 percent in fiscal 2007 and 2006 

  

we utilize 18 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 4 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and 2 for skating and outdoor products in addition we sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwnikestorecom  and we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

 

 nike’s united states distribution centers for footwear are located in wilsonville oregon and memphis tennessee apparel and equipment products are shipped from our memphis tennessee tigard oregon and foothill ranch california distribution centers cole haan products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire converse products are shipped from ontario california and hurley products are distributed from irvine california 

international markets 

in fiscal 2008 nonus sales including nonus sales of cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey umbro and nike golf accounted for 57 percent of total revenues compared to 53 percent in fiscal 2007 and 53 percent in fiscal 2006 we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world we estimate that we sell to more than 27000 retail accounts outside the united states excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees we operate 11 distribution centers outside of the united states in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 9 percent of total nonus sales 

we operate the following retail outlets outside the united states 

 

 international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina australia austria belgium brazil bulgaria canada chile croatia cyprus czech republic denmark finland france germany greece hong kong hungary indonesia india ireland israel italy japan korea lebanon macau malaysia mexico new zealand the netherlands norway people’s republic of china the philippines poland portugal russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sri lanka sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united arab emirates the united kingdom uruguay and vietnam 

  

significant customer 

no customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales during fiscal 2008 

orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2008 were 88 billion compared to 77 billion for the same period last year this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although some orders may be cancelled reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley umbro nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

product research and development 

we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

manufacturing 

virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2008 contract suppliers in china vietnam indonesia and thailand manufactured 36 percent 33 percent 21 percent and 9 percent of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india italy and south africa to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries our largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 6 percent of total fiscal 2008 footwear production 

almost all of nike brand apparel production was manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 34 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china thailand indonesia malaysia vietnam turkey sri lanka honduras mexico taiwan israel cambodia india and bangladesh our largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 8 percent of total fiscal 2008 apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike ihm inc and nike suzhou sports company ltd both whollyowned subsidiaries of nike and independent contractors in china and taiwan are our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic 

  

fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike’s contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2008 sojitz america provided financing and purchasing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada chile brazil india indonesia the philippines malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 14 percent of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire in 2011 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could abate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states the european union “eu” and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally which might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

footwear imports into the european union 

from 1994 through january 1 2005 the eu imposed limits or “quotas” on the import of certain types of footwear manufactured in china footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above nine euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” was excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas did not have a material effect on our business however as part of china’s 2001 accession to the world trade organization “wto” china entered into an agreement with the eu and other wto members to abide by a special safeguard arrangement whereby quotas could be imposed on any product sourced in china including footwear if there was a surge in imports from china into another wto country and after a legal proceeding it was determined that such imports were injuring a domestic producer additionally under longstanding wto rules all wto member countries reserved the right to impose 1 safeguard measures temporary quotas if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that increased imports 

  

are injuring another wto member’s domestic industry and 2 antidumping measures if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that imports are being sold at an unfair low price in another wto member’s home market and those imports were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry 

accordingly with the phaseout of the quotas at the beginning of 2005 and the expiration of a separate eu antidumping case in 2003 against footwear made in china indonesia and thailand there has been renewed pressure from some parts of the eu footwear manufacturing sector to reimpose some level of trade protection on imported footwear from china india vietnam and other exporting countries in july 2005 the european commission “ec” at the request of the european domestic footwear industry initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam nike and all other major athletic footwear manufacturers participated actively as respondents in this investigation and took the position that athletic footwear i should not be within the product scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october 2006 on definitive duties of 165 for china and 10 for vietnam but excluded staf from the measures and also agreed to implement the duties for two years rather than the normal fiveyear period as a result these measures did not significantly impact our business and we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position regarding these trade measures 

we understand that since the antidumping duties on nonstaf leather footwear imposed in 2006 will expire on october 8 2008 the eu domestic footwear industry has requested that the ec initiate a review of those measures the ec will scrutinize the request closely and make a decision by early october 2008 whether to initiate a review and if so the scope of that review if the ec conducts a review the current definitive antidumping duties will remain in force for an additional 15 months until the conclusion of the review in late 2009 or early 2010 it is also possible that the ec could initiate a socalled “interim” review of the antidumping measures in which case the ec may review the scope of the staf exemption and the level of the duties among other things 

trade relations with china 

china represents an important sourcing and marketing country for us many governments around the world are concerned about china’s growing and fastpaced economy compliance with wto rules currency valuation and high trade deficits as a result there is a wide range of legislative proposals that have been introduced to address these concerns while some of these concerns are justified we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations representing a wide variety of sectors eg services manufacturing agriculture to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii is reflective and considerate of china’s domestic economy and important role in the global economic community we believe that our major competitors as well as most other multinational companies stand in much the same position regarding these trade measures 

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

  

trademarks and patents 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign utility patents and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and patents issued for applications filed this year will have a remaining duration of from now to 2022 for design patents and from now to 2028 for utility patents we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

we had approximately 32500 employees at may 31 2008 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees is represented by a union with the exception of 23 employees in mexico the collective bargaining agreement for which expires in 2009 also in some countries outside of the united states local laws require representation for employees by works councils such as in the eu in which they are entitled to information and consultation on certain company decisions or other representation by an organization similar to a union although collective bargaining agreements are not involved there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

  

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on technical innovation and high quality products to compete in the market for our products 

although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products technical innovation and quality control in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop and test cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort if we fail to introduce technical innovation in our products the consumer demand for our products could decline and if we experience problems with the quality of our products we may incur substantial expense to remedy the problems 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes and sports teams and leagues to evaluate and promote our products and establish the authenticity of our products with consumers if certain of our endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into cost effective endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

  

failure of our contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture nike brand products and we impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers however from time to time contractors may not be in compliance with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set period at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk that we may be unable to sell excess products that we have ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the products that we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

  

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which in turn have had an adverse effect on our business from time to time retailers will be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in addition sales of our products depend in part on high quality merchandising and an appealing store environment to attract consumers which requires continuing investments by retailers retailers who experience financial difficulties may fail to make such investments or delay them resulting in reduced sales of and orders for our products 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these significant retailers have been increasing their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk in a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design or utility patent infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

  

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we engage in hedging activities to mitigate the impact of foreign currencies on our financial results see note 16 to our financial statements risk management and derivatives our hedging activities are designed to reduce and delay but not to completely eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in 

  

our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in manufacturing and transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from any adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology in our supply chain and any failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including for design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on 

  

the reliability of these supply chain systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations and it could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem and may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

our financial results may be adversely affected if substantial investments in businesses and operations fail to produce expected returns 

from time to time we may invest in business infrastructure acquisitions of new businesses and expansion of existing businesses such as our retail operations which require substantial cash investments and management attention we believe cost effective investments are essential to business growth and profitability however significant investments are subject to typical risks and uncertainties inherent in acquiring or expanding a business the failure if any significant investment to provide the returns or profitability that we expect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and divert management attention from more profitable business operations 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individuals could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 90 percent of our class a common stock if all of his class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 18 percent of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that the holders of class a common stock shares elect threefourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet analyst expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and 

  

are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts nikeowned retail including stores and ecommerce and independent distributors franchisees and licensees in the united states and worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories businesses our strategy is to create longterm revenue growth by creating compelling consumer experiences by creating and delivering innovative “must have” products deep personal connections with our brands and compelling retail presentation 

we strive to convert revenue growth to shareholder value by driving operating excellence in several key areas 

 

  

  

  

  

 by executing this strategy we aim to deliver the following longterm financial goals 

 

  

   

  

 in fiscal 2008 we met or exceeded these financial goals our revenues grew 14 to 186 billion net income grew 26 to 19 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 374 a 28 increase versus fiscal 2007 these reported results included combined gains from the sale of our starter brand and nike bauer hockey businesses of 354 million net of tax in fiscal 2008 and the gain recognized on the saleleaseback of the oregon footwear distribution center of 100 million net of tax in fiscal 2007 onetime tax benefits of 1054 million and 255 million recognized in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively operational losses of 133 million net of tax from umbro which we acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 and a 96 million gain net of tax from the converse arbitration ruling settlement in fiscal 2007 we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency losses included in other expense income net resulted in a yearoveryear increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 6 

for the year the increase in net income was higher than our rate of revenue growth due to a reduction in our effective tax rate and improved gross margins partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue fiscal 2008 results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of 74 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2007 primarily as a result of the 1054 million onetime tax benefit received in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 also reflected in the yearoveryear effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside of the united states our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate gross margins for the year grew 110 basis points versus the prior year as inventory management and strategic price increases were partially offset by higher product costs and increased closeout sales the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to higher investments in growth drivers such as athlete and sport team endorsers of our products spending around major sporting events key product initiatives investments in company owned retail and nonnike brand businesses as well as normal wage increases our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program in addition we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased cash paid for share repurchases our return on invested capital increased as compared to fiscal 2007 although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year we continue to believe these are appropriate longterm goals 

results of operations 

 

  

   

consolidated operating results 

revenues 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

during fiscal 2008 changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth strong demand for nike brand products continued to drive revenue growth as all four of our geographic regions and on a consolidated basis all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth the us region contributed nearly 2 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008 excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates our international regions contributed nearly 7 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2008 as all of our international regions posted higher revenues our other businesses comprised of results from cole haan converse exeter brands group whose primary business was the starter brand business which was sold on december 17 2007 hurley international nike bauer hockey which was sold on april 17 2008 nike golf and umbro which was acquired on march 3 2008 contributed the remaining consolidated constantcurrency revenue growth as cole haan converse hurley and nike golf posted higher yearoveryear revenues 

by product group our worldwide nike brand footwear revenue grew 14 and contributed more than 12 billion of incremental revenue for fiscal 2008 our worldwide nike branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 14 and 10 for the year respectively and combined added approximately 750 million of incremental revenue our other businesses reported revenue growth of 15 and combined added more than 330 million of incremental revenue 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2007 changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth all four of our geographic regions and on a consolidated basis all three of our product business units delivered revenue growth excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates both the us region and our international regions each contributed more than 25 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2007 sales in our other businesses contributed the remaining 2 percentage points of the consolidated constantcurrency revenue growth as each business within the group posted higher revenues 

by product group our worldwide nike brand footwear revenue grew 7 and contributed nearly 550 million of incremental revenue for fiscal 2007 our worldwide nike branded apparel and equipment businesses reported revenue growth of 10 and 12 for the year respectively and combined added more than 500 million of incremental revenue 

gross margin 

 

   

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

during fiscal 2008 the primary factors contributing to the 110 basis point increase in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows 

 

  

  

 the factors driving an increased gross margin percentage were partially offset by lower apparel inline gross pricing margins primarily driven by higher product costs most notably in the us and emea regions and increased apparel closeout sales primarily in the us region 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2007 the primary factors contributing to the 10 basis point decrease in the consolidated gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows 

 

  

  

  

 selling and administrative expense 

 

  

  

   

fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

in fiscal 2008 selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 120 basis points driven primarily by strategic investments in both demand creation and operating overhead changes in currency exchange rates increased selling and administrative expense growth by four percentage points 

on a constantcurrency basis demand creation expense increased 15 versus the prior year the yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to investments in athlete and sport team endorsers of our products spending around major sporting events including the 2008 olympics in beijing and the european football championships key product initiatives such as men’s training in the us and retail presentation 

excluding the effects of changes in exchange rates operating overhead increased 14 versus the prior year the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nikeowned retail nonnike brand businesses emerging markets and normal wage inflation and performance compensation 

we believe total selling and administrative expenses will grow faster than our rate of revenue growth in fiscal 2009 driven primarily by strategic investments in demand creation including spending around the 2008 olympics in beijing and the european football championships and increased investments in athlete and team endorsers of our products 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in fiscal 2007 selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 90 basis points however excluding the 1419 million pretax charge relating to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was consistent with the prior year 

on a constantcurrency basis demand creation expense increased 7 versus the prior year the yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to investments in the nike air ®  nike nike pro and force basketball campaigns for fiscal year 2007 constantcurrency growth in demand creation expense was consistent with our constantcurrency revenue growth 

excluding stockbased compensation expense and the effects of changes in exchange rates operating overhead increased 7 which was in line with our constantcurrency revenue growth the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nikeowned retail and nonnike brands as well as normal wage inflation and performance based compensation 

other expense income net 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

other expense income net is comprised substantially of gains and losses from hedging and remeasurement of nonfunctional currency balances disposals of fixed assets as well as other unusual or nonrecurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other expense income net are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments and related information  

in fiscal 2008 other expense income net included foreign currency hedge losses that were partially offset by the 320 million gain on the sale of nike bauer hockey and the 286 million gain on the sale of the starter 

  

brand business other expense income net in fiscal 2007 is primarily comprised of the 147 million gain on the saleleaseback of our oregon footwear distribution center and the 142 million benefit from the settlement of the converse arbitration partially offset by foreign currency hedge losses 

in fiscal 2008 we estimate that the combination of favorable translation of foreign currencydenominated profits from international businesses and the foreign currency losses included in other expense income net resulted in a yearoveryear increase in consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 122 million 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

for fiscal 2007 other expense income net was primarily comprised of the 147 million gain on the saleleaseback of our oregon footwear distribution center and the 142 million benefit from the settlement of the converse arbitration offset by foreign currency hedge losses the foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the euro since we entered into these hedge contracts 

the change in other expense income net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal 2007 which were more than offset by the converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our oregon footwear distribution center discussed above compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 which were more than offset by the 519 million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the converse arbitration the gain on the sale of the oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the us region line and the converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the other line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments and related information  

in fiscal 2007 the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits most notably in the emea region we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other expense income net and the favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year 

income taxes 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 was 248 74 percentage points lower than the prior year over the last few years several of our international entities generated losses for which we did not recognize the corresponding tax benefits as the realization of those benefits was uncertain in the first quarter of fiscal 2008 we took steps necessary to realize these benefits resulting in a onetime tax benefit of 1054 million also reflected in the yearoveryear effective tax rate improvement was a reduction in our ongoing effective tax rate resulting from our profits earned outside the united states our effective tax rates for these operations are generally lower than the us statutory rate 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in fiscal 2007 our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits from our operations outside the united states our tax rate on these operations is generally lower than the us statutory rate these benefits included the 10year european tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 which is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015 this agreement which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007 favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 

  

futures orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2008 were more than 11 higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2007 this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 3 percentage points to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year excluding this currency impact unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse hurley umbro nike golf and retail sales across all brands

us region 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

during fiscal 2008 the increase in us footwear revenue was the result of lowsingle digit growth in unit sales and a slight increase in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales and average selling price per pair was driven by higher demand for our nike brand sportswear products and brand jordan products partially offset by a decrease in demand for our nike brand basketball products the increase in average selling price per pair was also attributable to strategic price increases and an increased sales mix of higher priced nike brand sportswear and brand jordan products 

the yearoveryear increase in us apparel revenues during fiscal 2008 reflected an increase in unit sales mostly offset by lower average selling prices the increase in unit sales was primarily driven by higher closeout sales and increased demand for nike brand sports performance products partially offset by lower unit sales of sportswear and brand jordan products average selling prices decreased primarily as a result of a higher mix of closeout sales 

the yearoveryear decrease in us equipment revenues during fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of lower unit sales of accessory products and fewer closeout sales 

  

pretax income for the us region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2008 as a result of higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses partially offset by higher gross margins driven by footwear the increase in demand creation was driven by higher sports marketing expenses and investments in the retail presentation of our key wholesale customers the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in nikeowned retail and normal wage inflation 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2007 the increase in us footwear revenue was attributable to high singledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven by higher demand for our nike brand sportswear products kids’ product including boys and girls sportswear brand jordan products and men’s running products due to the growth of our nike performance models the decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the prior year was the result of a higher mix of offprice products combined with growth in lower priced kids’ product 

the yearoveryear increase in us apparel revenues during fiscal 2007 reflected mid singledigit growth in unit sales combined with a low singledigit increase in average price per unit the increase in unit sales versus the prior year was driven by doubledigit growth in nike brand sport performance apparel while the improvement in average selling prices was driven by team and licensed apparel and brand jordan products 

pretax income for the us region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2007 as a result of lower gross margins the gross margin decline was primarily attributable to a higher level of closeout sales and sales discounts compared to the prior year most notably in our footwear business selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2006 but represented a lower percentage of revenue due to operating overhead leverage 

emea region 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 11 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2008 nearly all markets within the region increased revenues during the year the emerging markets in the region grew nearly 25 driven by strong results in russia turkey and south africa increases in northern europe and the uk also contributed significantly to the revenue growth 

excluding changes in exchange rates footwear revenues increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year the increase in footwear revenue was attributable to doubledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a low singledigit decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our nike brand soccer and sportswear products the decrease in average selling price per pair resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product models most notably within our nike brand sportswear product lines 

  

on a currency neutral basis emea apparel revenue increased 8 percentage points during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of increased unit sales and a slight increase in average selling prices the increase in unit sales was driven primarily by increased demand for sports performance products most notably soccer 

the increase in pretax income for the emea region during fiscal 2008 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues favorable foreign currency translation and a higher gross margin percentage partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues the gross margin improvement in fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to improved yearoveryear hedge rates and improved margins on closeout product the increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by an increase in demand creation spending primarily attributable to spending around the european football championships as a result of retail expansion and overall business growth across the region operating overhead expenses increased for the year but at a slower rate than revenue growth 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2007 excluding changes in currency exchange rates all markets within the region except the uk and france increased revenues during the year the emerging markets in the region grew over 30 driven by strong results in greece russia turkey and south africa increases in northern europe italy and spain also contributed significantly to the revenue growth after experiencing challenging retail conditions in the uk and france during fiscal 2007 we have started to see signs of improvement in these markets including yearoveryear futures growth 

excluding changes in exchange rates footwear revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the increase in footwear revenue was attributable to low singledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our nike brand sport culture products most notably “metro” and outdoor products the growth in unit sales more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pair which resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product styles combined with an increase in closeout sales 

excluding changes in exchange rates apparel revenues increased 7 percentage points during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the yearoveryear increase reflected high singledigit growth in unit sales driven by both sports culture and sports performance products combined with a low singledigit increase in average price per unit 

the increase in pretax income for the emea region during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses which on a currencyneutral basis increased 4 percentage points versus fiscal 2006 the lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in warehousing costs and lower inline net pricing margins primarily in footwear attributable to sales discounts higher product costs and a shift in product mix to lower priced models the increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating overhead most notably normal wage inflation and growth in the emerging markets combined with a slight increase in demand creation 

  

asia pacific region 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of revenue growth for fiscal 2008 nearly all countries across the region delivered revenue growth on a currency neutral basis china continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as fiscal 2008 revenues increased 50 on a currencyneutral basis driven by the expansion in both the number of stores selling nike product and sales through existing stores constantcurrency revenues in japan increased at a low single digit rate during fiscal 2008 

footwear revenue growth for fiscal 2008 reflected increased unit sales most notably in china partially offset by lower average selling prices driven primarily by a shift in mix from higher priced to lower priced models the yearoveryear increase in apparel revenue was driven by increased demand in china 

the increase in pretax income for the asia pacific region for fiscal 2008 was driven by higher revenues improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation which more than offset slightly higher selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue the gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by reduced warehousing costs improved yearoveryear currency hedge rates and improved margins on closeout product the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to spending around the 2008 olympics in beijing overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion primarily in china also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses which grew slightly slower than revenues 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007 while the majority of countries within the region reported doubledigit sales increases for the year china continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as revenues increased nearly 26 on a currencyneutral basis the revenue growth in china is primarily due to expansion in both the number of stores selling nike product as well as sales through existing doors constantcurrency revenues in japan increased only slightly during fiscal 2007 despite sustained softness in the japan market we are starting to see positive signs including higher gross margins improvements in sell through at retail and improving futures conversion trends 

the growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales most notably in china and korea partially offset by lower average selling prices which resulted primarily from strategies to improve consumer value in japan and korea combined with a change in the mix of products sold across the region the yearoveryear increase in apparel revenue was also driven by increased demand in china and korea 

the increase in pretax income for the asia pacific region for fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation which more than offset higher selling and 

  

administrative expenses the gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by better inventory management improved yearoveryear hedge rates and reduced warehousing costs the improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales incentives most notably in japan combined with efforts to improve consumer value in japan and korea the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased investments in demand creation most notably the just do it and force basketball campaigns overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion in china and korea also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses

the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2008 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues improved gross margins and operating overhead leverage combined with favorable foreign currency translation these factors were partially offset by higher demand creation spending as a percentage of revenue the gross margin improvement was driven primarily by higher inline net pricing margins resulting from a better mix of products sold and fewer discounts offered in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 the increase in demand creation spending during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to investments in sports marketing most notably in soccer brand events including spending around run americas iii and investments in the retail presentation of nike  and nike pro products

the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses the gross margin improvement was driven by higher inline net pricing margins resulting from fewer discounts being offered in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 combined with a change in product mix the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to investments in demand creation most notably the run americas ii and women’s fitness campaigns the world cup and retail resources 

  

other businesses 

 

 fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 

the increase in other business revenues was driven by higher revenues across all businesses most notably converse and nike golf in fiscal 2008 revenues at converse increased more than 29 versus the prior year to approximately 729 million driven by strong consumer demand in the united states and internationally while nike golf grew 12 to nearly 725 million revenues at cole haan increased 6 to 496 million driven by strong results at companyowned retail stores revenues at hurley increased 14 to 171 million 

during fiscal 2008 growth at converse and nike golf combined with margin improvements across most businesses drove the yearoveryear increase in pretax income fiscal 2007 pretax income included a 142 million benefit relating to the settlement of an arbitration ruling involving converse and a former south american licensee fiscal 2008 pretax income for our other businesses would have increased approximately 18 versus fiscal 2007 excluding this favorable settlement 

as part of our long term growth strategy we continually evaluate our existing portfolio of businesses as well as new business opportunities to ensure the company is investing in those businesses with the largest growth potential and highest returns on march 3 2008 we completed the acquisition of 100 of the outstanding shares of umbro plc “umbro” a leading united kingdombased global soccer brand for a purchase price of £2905 million in cash approximately 5764 million inclusive of direct transaction costs this acquisition is intended to significantly strengthen our market position in the united kingdom and expand nike’s global leadership in soccer a key area of growth for the company this acquisition also provides scaled positions in emerging soccer markets such as china russia and brazil the results of umbro’s operations have been included in the company’s consolidated financial statements and in the other operating segment since the date of acquisition umbro which was listed on the london stock exchange prior to our acquisition reported in their 2006 annual report that revenues for calendar year 2006 were approximately 276 million £1495 million and estimated that the combination of umbro’s calendar year 2006 wholesale revenue and estimated sales revenue earned by umbro’s licensees from the sale of umbro products totaled approximately 755 million £4094 million 

following a strategic review of the company’s existing business portfolio we concluded that the starter and bauer hockey businesses did not align with our longterm growth priorities on december 17 2007 we completed the sale of the starter brand business for 60 million in cash on april 17 2008 we completed the sale of the bauer hockey business for net proceeds of 1892 million after working capital adjustments these transactions resulted in gains of approximately 286 million and 320 million respectively which are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

the increase in other business revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by doubledigit revenue growth across nearly all businesses led by converse and nike golf in fiscal 2007 revenues at converse increased more than 20 versus the prior year to over 550 million driven by strong consumer demand in the united states and internationally while nike golf grew 12 to nearly 650 million 

  

during fiscal 2007 improved profitability at converse driven by increased wholesale revenues in the united states and growth in our international licensing business combined with growth at nike golf contributed to the increase in pretax income versus fiscal 2006 fiscal 2007 results also include the benefit of the 142 million settlement of the arbitration ruling involving converse and a former south american licensee this dispute was settled during the first quarter ended august 31 2006 

liquidity and capital resources 

fiscal 2008 cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was approximately 19 billion in both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 our primary source of operating cash flow in fiscal 2008 was net income of 19 billion adjustments for noncash depreciation and stockbased compensation were offset by increases in deferred income taxes as well as investments in working capital and other assets and liabilities to support growth in the business the increase in working capital during fiscal 2008 was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories and accounts receivable partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to higher sales in the last quarter of 2008 the increase in inventories reflects yearoveryear growth in reported futures and higher inventories to support the expansion of nikeowned retail stores slightly offset by better inventory management the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year 

cash used by investing activities was 04 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to 01 billion provided by investing activities during fiscal 2007 the yearoveryear increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of umbro for approximately 06 billion offset by proceeds from the divestitures of our nike bauer hockey and starter brand businesses of 02 billion 

cash used in financing activities was 12 billion during fiscal 2008 compared to 11 billion used in fiscal 2007 the increase versus fiscal 2007 was primarily due to an increase in share repurchases and dividends paid discussed below partially offset by a decrease in payments of long term debt as we made a 250 million repayment of corporate bonds in fiscal 2007 

in fiscal 2008 we purchased approximately 206 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 12 billion as of the end of fiscal 2008 we have repurchased 386 million shares for 21 billion under the 3 billion program approved by our board of directors in june 2006 we expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2008 were 0875 compared to 071 in fiscal 2007 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20 to 30 of the trailing twelvemonths’ earnings per share paid out on a quarterly basis we review our dividend policy from time to time and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

  

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2008 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

 

  

 in addition to the cash payments we are obligated to furnish our endorsers with nike products for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

 

  

 the total longterm liability for uncertain tax positions was 2511 million excluding related interest and penalties at may 31 2008 we are not able to reasonably estimate when or if cash payments of the longterm liability for uncertain tax positions will occur 

  

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2008 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2008 letters of credit of 1934 million were outstanding generally for the purchase of inventory 

capital resources 

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec under which 1 billion in debt securities may be issued in may 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 5000 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the program have issued 2400 million in mediumterm notes as of may 31 2008 2150 million in mediumterm notes remained outstanding we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2009 depending on general corporate needs 

during fiscal 2008 one of our japanese subsidiaries entered into a total of ¥50 billion approximately 474 million as of may 31 2008 in shortterm loans to meet general operating needs the interest rates on the loans are based on the prevailing tokyo interbank offer rate of our election plus a spread resulting in a weighted average allin rate of 106 at may 31 2008 

during fiscal 2007 another of our japanese subsidiaries entered into a ¥30 billion approximately 285 million as of may 31 2008 loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings the interest rate on the facility is based on the sixmonth japanese yen london interbank offer rate “jpy libor” plus a spread resulting in an all in rate of approximately 112 at may 31 2008 this loan facility was renewed during fiscal 2008 subsequent to may 31 2008 this loan facility expired and was replaced with intercompany borrowings 

during fiscal 2007 the same japanese subsidiary entered into a ¥50 billion approximately 474 million as of may 31 2008 term loan that replaced certain intercompany borrowings and matures on february 14 2012 the interest rate on the loan is approximately 15 and interest is paid semiannually 

as of may 31 2008 we had no amounts outstanding under our multiyear 1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks the facility matures in december 2012 and can be extended for one additional year on its next anniversary date based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing london interbank offer rate “libor” plus 015 the facility fee is 005 of the total commitment 

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur as well as a minimum capitalization ratio in the 

  

event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2008 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was no amount outstanding at may 31 2008 or may 31 2007 we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

recently adopted accounting standards 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fin 48 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” we adopted the provisions of fin 48 on june 1 2007 see note 8 in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

in june 2006 the fasb ratified the consensus reached in emerging issues task force “eitf” issue no 062 “accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 43” “eitf 062” eitf 062 clarifies recognition guidance on the accrual of employees’ rights to compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement the adoption of eitf 062 on june 1 2007 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows 

recently issued accounting standards 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” “fas 157” fas 157 defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements the provisions of fas 157 for financial assets and liabilities are effective for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2008 and the provisions of fas 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities except for items recognized at fair value on a recurring basis are effective for the fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions for nonfinancial assets and liabilities we have evaluated the provisions of fas 157 for financial assets and liabilities and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in february 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “fas 159” fas 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value the provisions of fas 159 are effective for the fiscal year beginning june 1 2008 we have evaluated the provisions of fas 159 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

in december 2007 the fasb issued sfas no 141 revised 2007 “business combinations” “fas 141r” and sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “fas 160” these standards aim to improve simplify and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements the provisions of fas 141r and fas 160 are effective for the fiscal year beginning june 1 2009 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fas 141r and fas 160 

  

in march 2008 the fasb issued sfas no 161 “disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities” “fas 161” fas 161 is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand their effects on an entity’s financial position financial performance and cash flows the provisions of fas 161 are effective for the quarter ending february 28 2009 we do not expect that the adoption of fas 161 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

  

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result 

  

in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property plant and equipment may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded within other expense income net we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to among other things technological changes economic conditions and changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or when events indicate that an impairment exists as required by fas 142 in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset tests require the use of discounted cash flow valuation models those models require estimates of future revenue profits expenditures and working capital these estimates are determined by evaluating historical trends current budgets operating plans and industry data our estimates may change in future periods due to among other things technological change economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinitelived intangible assets would be classified within other expense income net 

intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in these cases we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value any significant impairment charges would be classified within other expense income net 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted “fas 133” have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes beyond the threshold allowed by fas 133 we are 

  

required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense income net during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

we use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries when appropriately designated as a hedge in accordance with fas 133 the change in fair value of the forward contracts hedging our net investments is reported in the cumulative translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders’ equity to offset the foreign currency translation adjustments on those investments 

as the value of our underlying net investments in whollyowned international subsidiaries is known at the time a hedge is placed the designated hedge is matched to the portion of our net investment at risk accordingly the variability involved in net investment hedges is substantially less than that of other types of hedge transactions and we do not expect any material ineffectiveness in accordance with fas 133 we consider on a quarterly basis the need to redesignate existing hedge relationships based on changes in the underlying net investment should the level of our net investment decrease below hedged levels any resulting ineffectiveness would be reported directly to earnings in the period incurred 

stockbased compensation 

as of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with fas 123r under the provisions of fas 123r the fair value of stockbased compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists 

  

that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding infrequently occurring or unusual items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin 48 on a quarterly basis we reevaluate the probability that a tax position will be effectively sustained and the appropriateness of the amount recognized for uncertain tax positions based on factors including changes in facts or circumstances changes in tax law settled audit issues and new audit activity changes in our assessment may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period our assessment changes we recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts recorded contingent liabilities are based on the best information available and actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain if future adjustments to estimated probable future losses or actual losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense income net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred in addition to contingent liabilities recorded for probable losses we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party and intercompany transactions we also use forward contracts to hedge our investment in the net assets of certain international subsidiaries to offset foreign currency translation and economic exposures related to our net investment in those subsidiaries 

  

when we begin hedging exposures the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve to eighteen months although at may 31 2008 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 34 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by one of our european subsidiaries when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros british pounds and japanese yen 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of commercial paper bank loans and fixed rate debt of varying maturities and have entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 349 million and 137 million at may 31 2008 and may 31 2007 respectively the increase in var as of may 31 2008 occurred due to a higher notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments coupled with increased foreign currency volatility as of may 31 2008 compared to may 31 2007 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 323 million and 365 million during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 respectively 

  

details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below the instruments not included in the var are intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates weighted average interest rates for the fixed rate swapped to floating rate debt reflect the effective interest rates as of may 31 2008 

 

 intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties as discussed above 

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary

sales and marketing 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements on page 73 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

united states market 

in fiscal 2007 sales in the united states including us sales of cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey and nike golf accounted for approximately 47 percent of total revenues compared to 47 percent in fiscal 2006 and 46 percent in fiscal 2005 we sell to approximately 21000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2007 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 29 percent of nike brand sales in the united states excluding sales from nike bauer hockey and nike golf and 24 percent of total sales in the united states 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal year 2007 94 percent of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey and nike golf were made under the futures program compared to 90 percent in fiscal 2006 and 91 percent in fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2007 81 percent of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey and nike golf were made under the futures program compared to 69 percent in fiscal 2006 and 71 percent in fiscal 2005 

  

we utilize 18 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 14 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf in addition we sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwnikestorecom  and we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

 

 nike’s domestic distribution centers for footwear are located in wilsonville oregon and memphis tennessee apparel and equipment products are shipped from our memphis tennessee tigard oregon and foothill ranch california distribution centers cole haan and nike bauer hockey products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire and converse products are shipped from ontario and fontana california 

international markets 

in fiscal 2007 nonus sales including nonus sales of cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey and nike golf accounted for 53 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2007 compared to 53 percent in fiscal 2006 and 54 percent in fiscal 2005 we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees around the world we estimate that we sell to more than 25000 retail accounts outside the united states excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees we operate 11 distribution centers in europe asia australia africa and canada in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 9 percent of nike brand sales outside the united states excluding sales from nike bauer hockey and nike golf and approximately 9 percent of total nonus sales 

we operate the following retail outlets outside the united states

significant customer 

foot locker inc which operates a chain of retail stores specializing in athletic footwear and apparel accounted for approximately 10 percent of global net sales of nike inc during fiscal 2007 no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales during fiscal 2007 

orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2007 were 77 billion compared to 66 billion for the same period last year this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although some orders may be cancelled reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

product research and development 

we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort 

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

manufacturing 

virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2007 contract suppliers in china vietnam indonesia and thailand manufactured 35 percent 31 percent 21 percent and 12 percent of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india italy and south africa to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries our largest single footwear factory accounted for approximately 6 percent of total fiscal 2007 footwear production 

almost all of nike brand apparel production for sale to the united states market and all of our apparel production for sale to the international market was manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 36 countries most of this apparel production occurred in china thailand indonesia malaysia turkey honduras vietnam sri lanka mexico taiwan cambodia india and bangladesh our largest single apparel factory accounted for approximately 6 percent of total fiscal 2007 apparel production 

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike ihm inc nike suzhou sports company ltd whollyowned subsidiaries of nike and independent contractors in china and taiwan are our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and 

  

threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” a large japanese trading company has performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2007 sojitz america provided such financing services for nike brand products sold in argentina uruguay canada chile mexico brazil india panama the philippines malaysia south africa china korea and thailand excluding products produced and sold in the same country approximately 13 percent of nike brand sales occurred in those countries any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2008 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could abate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

as a result of the trade act of 2003 the united states implemented significant new federal requirements for cargo security focused on imports of containerized cargo we are a significant importer of containerized cargo accordingly we participate actively in appropriate governmental programs such as the customs trade partnership against terrorism to reduce risks of possible supply disruptions caused by us and international cargo security mandates and terrorism we and a broad coalition of businesses have been actively working with the united states congress as it considers legislation to make us ports more secure we are actively following this proposed legislation and believe that any legislation if passed will not have a significant impact on our supply chain we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position of risk regarding this potential legislation 

all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states the european union “eu” and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally which might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

  

footwear imports into the european union 

from 1994 through january 1 2005 the eu imposed limits or “quotas” on the import of certain types of footwear manufactured in china footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above nine euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” was excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas did not have a material effect on our business however as part of china’s 2001 accession to the world trade organization “wto” china entered into an agreement with the eu and other wto members to abide by a special safeguard arrangement whereby quotas could be imposed on any product sourced in china including footwear if there was a surge in imports from china into another wto country and after a legal proceeding it was determined that such imports were injuring a domestic producer additionally under longstanding wto rules all wto member countries reserved the right to impose 1 safeguard measures temporary quotas if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that increased imports are injuring another wto member’s domestic industry and 2 antidumping measures if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that imports are being sold at an unfair low price in another wto member’s home market and those imports were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry 

accordingly with the phaseout of the quotas at the beginning of 2005 and the expiration of a separate eu antidumping case in 2003 against footwear made in china indonesia and thailand there has been renewed pressure from some parts of the eu footwear manufacturing sector to reimpose some level of trade protection on imported footwear from china india vietnam and other exporting countries in july 2005 the european commission at the request of the european domestic footwear industry initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam nike and all other major athletic footwear manufacturers participated actively as respondents in this investigation and took the position that athletic footwear i should not be within the product scope of the investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation our arguments were successful and the eu agreed in october 2006 on definitive duties of 165 for china and 10 for vietnam but excluded staf from the measures and also agreed to implement the duties for two rather than the normal fiveyear period as a result these measures did not significantly impact our business and we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position regarding these trade measures 

vietnam imports into the united states 

we currently source a portion of our footwear and apparel products from factories in vietnam in 2001 the united states congress and the vietnamese national assembly approved a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides reciprocal nondiscriminatory normal trade relations “ntr” between the us and vietnam following congressional approval of granting vietnam permanent normal trade relations in 2006 vietnam is now a full member of the wto vietnam’s entry into the wto will provide us greater certainty about our business within vietnam it will likewise enable us to further expand our production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamesesourced products to continue to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates 

trade relations with china 

china represents a critically important sourcing and marketing country for us many governments around the world are concerned about china’s growing and fastpaced economy compliance with wto rules and high trade deficits as a result there is a wide range of legislative proposals that have been introduced to address these concerns while some of these concerns are justified we are working with broad coalitions of global businesses and trade associations who represent a wide variety of sectors eg services manufacturing agriculture to help ensure that any legislation enacted and implemented i addresses legitimate and core concerns ii is consistent with international trade rules and iii is reflective and considerate of china’s domestic economy and important role in the global economic community we believe that our major competitors as well as most other multinational companies stand in much the same position regarding these trade measures 

  

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas puma and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

trademarks and patents 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign utility patents and thousands of us and foreign design patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and have a remaining duration of from now to at least 2021 for design patents and from now to at least 2027 for utility patents we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

we had approximately 30200 employees at may 31 2007 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees is represented by a union with the exception of nike bauer hockey of nike bauer hockey’s employees approximately 39 percent or approximately 157 are covered by two union collective bargaining agreements with two separate bargaining units the collective bargaining agreements expire on various dates from 2007 through 2008 there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 1a risk   factors tableend special note regarding forwardlooking statements and analyst reports 

certain written and oral statements other than purely historical information including estimates projections statements relating to nike’s business plans objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based made or incorporated by reference from time to time by nike or its representatives in this report other reports filings with the securities and exchange commission or sec press releases conferences or otherwise are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended forwardlooking statements include without limitation any statement that may predict forecast indicate or imply future results performance or achievements and may contain the words “believe” “anticipate” “expect” “estimate” “project” “will be” “will continue” “will likely result” or words or phrases of similar meaning forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by nike with the sec including forms 8k 10q and 10k and include among others the following international national and local general economic and market conditions the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear apparel and equipment markets intense competition among designers marketers distributors and sellers of athletic footwear apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers demographic changes changes in consumer preferences popularity of particular designs categories of products and sports seasonal and geographic demand for nike products difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences consumer demand for nike products and the various market factors described above difficulties in implementing operating and maintaining nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls including without limitation the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control interruptions in data and communications systems fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results including without limitation the fact that advance “futures” orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and atonce orders currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations and the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders the ability of nike to sustain manage or forecast its growth and inventories the size timing and mix of purchases of nike’s products new product development and introduction the ability to secure and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property performance and reliability of products customer service adverse publicity the loss of significant customers or suppliers dependence on distributors business disruptions increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings changes in business strategy or development plans general risks associated with doing business outside the united states including without limitation import duties tariffs quotas political and economic instability and terrorism changes in government regulations liability and other claims asserted against nike the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports 

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very 

  

competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this in addition to rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profits 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on technical innovation to compete in the market for our products 

although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort failure to introduce technical innovation in our products could result in a decline in consumer demand for our products 

  

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes and sports teams and leagues to evaluate and promote our products and establish the authenticity of our products with consumers if certain of our endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

failure of our contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture nike brand products and we impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers however from time to time contractors may not be in compliance with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set period at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports although we believe futures orders are an important indicator of our future revenues reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations returns and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including atonce closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

  

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk that we may be unable to sell excess products that we have ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the products that we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which in turn have had an adverse effect on our business from time to time retailers will be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

consolidation of retailers or concentration of retail market share among a few retailers may increase and concentrate our credit risk and impair our ability to sell our products 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment retail markets in some countries are dominated by a few large athletic footwear apparel and equipment retailers with many stores these significant retailers have been increasing their market share by expanding through acquisitions and construction of additional stores these situations concentrate our credit risk in a relatively small number of retailers and if any of these retailers were to experience a shortage of liquidity it would increase the risk that their outstanding payables to us may not be paid in addition increasing market share concentration among one or a few retailers in a particular country or region increases the risk that if any one of them substantially reduces their purchases of our products we may be unable to find a sufficient number of other retail outlets for our products to sustain the same level of sales and revenues 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design or 

  

utility patent infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we engage in hedging activities to mitigate the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on our financial results see note 16 to our financial statements risk management and derivatives our hedging 

  

activities are designed to reduce and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes infrastructure congestion or other factors and costs and delays associated with transitioning between manufacturers could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the 

  

development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from any adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology in our supply chain and any failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including for design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in all of our geographical regions in which we operate over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations and it could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individuals could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight cofounder and chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 90 percent of our class a common stock if all class a common stock were converted into class b common stock mr knight would own over 22 percent of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that the holders of class a common stock shares elect threefourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of our company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

we may fail to meet analyst expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as 

  

the analysts’ estimates of our future performance the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts nikeowned retail including stores and ecommerce and independent distributors and licensees in the united states and worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable global portfolio of branded footwear apparel equipment and accessories through this diverse portfolio of brands our strategy is to create longterm revenue growth by connecting with consumers across geographies we strive to convert revenue growth to value in three key areas 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 by executing this strategy we aim to deliver the following longterm financial goals 

 

  

   

  

 in fiscal 2007 we met the majority of these financial goals our revenues grew 9 to 163 billion net income grew 7 to 15 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 293 an 11 increase versus fiscal 2006 these reported results included a 1419 million pretax charge related to stockbased compensation expense recognized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “sharebased payment” “fas 123r” which we adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2007 see note 1— summary of significant accounting policies and note 10 — common stock in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the adoption of fas 123r and the effects of the converse arbitration ruling in fiscal 2006 and subsequent settlement in fiscal 2007 excluding these items our net income grew 11 and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 310 a 15 increase versus fiscal 2006 see reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the converse arbitration and stockbased compensation expense below 

fiscal 2007 results were positively affected by a reduction in our effective tax rate of 28 percentage points as compared to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of the european tax agreement the company finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 for the year the increase in net income was below our rate of revenue growth due to higher selling and administrative expenses versus the same period in the prior year the increase in selling and administrative expenses was attributable to the adoption of fas 123r and higher investments in growth drivers such as demand creation and operating overhead our earnings per share for the year grew at a higher rate than net income given lower outstanding shares due to repurchases made under our share repurchase program in addition we increased cash flow from operations and continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of fas 123r although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year we continue to believe these are appropriate longterm goals

selling and administrative expense 

 

   

  

 fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in fiscal 2007 selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues by 90 basis points however excluding the 1419 million pretax charge relating to the change in accounting for stockbased compensation selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues was consistent with the prior year 

on a constantcurrency basis demand creation expense increased 7 versus the prior year the yearoveryear increase was primarily attributable to investments in the nike air ®  nike nike pro and force basketball campaigns for fiscal year 2007 constantcurrency growth in demand creation expense was consistent with our constantcurrency revenue growth 

excluding stockbased compensation expense and the effects of changes in exchange rates operating overhead increased 7 which was in line with our constantcurrency revenue growth the increase in operating overhead was attributable to investments in growth drivers such as nikeowned retail and nonnike brands as well as normal wage inflation 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

in fiscal 2006 selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points for the year driven by operating overhead leverage changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by 1 percentage point 

in fiscal 2006 changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by 1 percentage point the growth in demand creation spending in fiscal 2006 was in line with our revenue growth the yearoveryear increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports 

  

marketing endorsement contracts and events increased spending on retail marketing programs instore marketing at our retail partners and advertising primarily around the global world cup and winter olympics campaigns and for the global air max 360™ footwear launch 

while consolidated revenues grew 9 in fiscal 2006 operating overhead for fiscal 2006 increased only 4 over fiscal 2005 as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by 1 percentage point excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in operating overhead for fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs both increased headcount and higher compensation to support the growth of our business including our other businesses and new nikeowned retail stores 

other income expense net 

 

 fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

other income expense net is comprised substantially of gains and losses associated with the conversion of nonfunctional currency receivables and payables the remeasurement of foreign currency derivative instruments disposals of fixed assets as well as other unusual or nonrecurring transactions that are outside the normal course of business 

for fiscal 2007 other income expense net was primarily comprised of the 147 million gain on the saleleaseback of our oregon footwear distribution center and the 142 million benefit from the settlement of the converse arbitration offset by foreign currency hedge losses the foreign currency hedge losses recognized in fiscal 2007 primarily reflect the strengthening of the euro since we entered into these hedge contracts 

the change in other income expense net versus the prior year period was primarily the result of foreign currency hedge losses in fiscal 2007 which were more than offset by the converse arbitration settlement and gain on the sale of our oregon footwear distribution center discussed above compared to foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 which were more than offset by the 519 million charge taken during the fourth quarter as a result of the converse arbitration foreign currency hedge gains and losses reported in other income expense net are reflected in the corporate line the gain on the sale of the oregon footwear distribution center is reflected in the us region line and the converse arbitration settlement is reflected in the other line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments and related information  

in fiscal 2007 the net foreign currency hedge losses discussed above were partially offset by favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits most notably in the emea region we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other income expense net and the favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits did not have a significant impact on consolidated income before income taxes for fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

the significant reduction in other income expense net for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year partially offset by the converse arbitration charge the fiscal 2006 hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts 

  

in fiscal 2006 these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits most significantly in the emea region we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other income expense net and the unfavorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 55 million for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year 

income taxes 

 

 fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in fiscal 2007 our effective tax rate reflects tax benefits from our operations outside the united states our tax rate on these operations is generally lower than the us statutory rate these benefits included the 10year european tax agreement finalized in the second quarter of fiscal 2007 which is effective for fiscal years 2006 through 2015 this agreement which provided a retroactive tax benefit for fiscal 2006 and the first quarter of fiscal 2007 favorably impacted our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal 2005 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 our ceo and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” to repatriate 500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an 85 dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations a 500 million repatriation was made during the quarter ended may 31 2006 comprised of both foreign earnings for which us taxes have previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested accordingly the provisions made did not have a material impact on the company’s income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year 

futures orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2007 were nearly 12 higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2006 this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates contributed approximately 1 percentage point to this reported futures growth versus the same period in the prior year excluding this currency impact unit sales volume increases for both footwear and apparel drove the growth in overall futures and advance orders the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

  

operating segments 

the breakdown of revenues follows 

 

 the breakdown of income before income taxes “pretax income” follows 

 

    

the following discussion includes disclosure of pretax income for our operating segments we have reported pretax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with sfas no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” as discussed in note 17 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements certain corporate costs are not included in pretax income of our operating segments 

us region 

 

 fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

during fiscal 2007 the increase in us footwear revenue was attributable to high singledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven by higher demand for our nike brand sport culture products kids’ product including boys and girls sport culture brand jordan products and men’s running products due to the growth of our nike performance models the decrease in average selling price per pair compared to the prior year was the result of a higher mix of offprice products combined with growth in lower priced kids’ product 

the yearoveryear increase in us apparel revenues during fiscal 2007 reflected mid singledigit growth in unit sales combined with a low singledigit increase in average price per unit the increase in unit sales versus the prior year was driven by doubledigit growth in nike brand sport performance apparel while the improvement in average selling prices was driven by team and licensed apparel and brand jordan products 

pretax income for the us region grew at a slower rate than revenue in fiscal 2007 as a result of lower gross margins the gross margin decline was primarily attributable to a higher level of closeout sales and sales discounts compared to the prior year most notably in our footwear business selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2006 but represented a lower percentage of revenue due to operating overhead leverage 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

during fiscal 2006 the increase in footwear revenues was due to a doubledigit growth in unit sales combined with low singledigit growth in the average selling price per pair the strong unit increase was driven by increased consumer demand across a majority of the footwear product categories most significantly high demand for our jordan branded and sport culture products the higher average selling price per pair was primarily due to increased consumer demand for products with a suggested retail price over 100 driven by jordan branded products as well as nike branded sport performance and sport culture products 

the increase in us apparel sales for fiscal 2006 was driven by increased unit sales in nike and jordan branded apparel partially offset by sales declines in licensed apparel primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the nba in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 the increases in nike branded apparel were primarily due to increased sales of sport performance products 

  

for the us region the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage the lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower inline net pricing margins for footwear due to higher product costs primarily the result of higher oil prices and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage the increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead the increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased advertising primarily due to the global campaigns discussed above the increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending for new nikeowned retail stores higher personnel costs and higher travel and meeting expenses 

emea region 

 

 fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 6 percentage points of the revenue growth during fiscal 2007 excluding changes in currency exchange rates all markets within the region except the uk and france increased revenues during the year the emerging markets in the region grew over 30 driven by strong results in greece russia turkey and south africa increases in northern europe italy and spain also contributed significantly to the revenue growth after experiencing challenging retail conditions in the uk and france during fiscal 2007 we have started to see signs of improvement in these markets including yearoveryear futures growth 

excluding changes in exchange rates footwear revenues increased 1 percentage point during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the increase in footwear revenue was attributable to low singledigit growth in unit sales partially offset by a slight decrease in the average selling price per pair the growth in unit sales was driven primarily by higher demand for our nike brand sport culture products most notably “metro” and outdoor products the growth in unit sales more than offset a decline in the average selling price per pair which resulted from a shift in product mix from higher priced to lower priced product styles combined with an increase in closeout sales 

excluding changes in exchange rates apparel revenues increased 7 percentage points during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year the yearoveryear increase reflected high singledigit growth in unit sales driven by both sports culture and sports performance products combined with a low singledigit increase in average price per unit 

the increase in pretax income for the emea region during fiscal 2007 compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the increase in revenues and favorable foreign currency translation partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and higher selling and administrative expenses which on a currencyneutral basis increased 4 percentage points versus fiscal 2006 the lower gross margin percentage in fiscal 2007 was attributable to an increase in warehousing costs and lower inline net pricing margins primarily in footwear 

  

attributable to sales discounts higher product costs and a shift in product mix to lower priced models the increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating overhead most notably normal wage inflation and growth in the emerging markets combined with a slight increase in demand creation 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2006 excluding changes in currency exchange rates all three product business units grew excluding currency changes the increase in footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales partially offset by declines in the average selling price per pair the increased unit sales were driven by increased demand for sport culture products the declines in the average selling price per pair were due in part to changes in the mix of inline products sold towards products with a lower average selling price and higher sales incentives as a result of a difficult retail environment in western europe the increase in emea apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales and average selling prices of nike branded apparel primarily increased unit sales of sport performance products including soccer products driven by the world cup and increased average selling prices across most apparel categories excluding changes in currency exchange rates sales increases in the emerging markets of our central europe middle east and africa unit led the revenue growth while sales increases in western and northern europe also contributed to the emea sales growth for fiscal 2006 

the increase in pretax income for the emea region for fiscal 2006 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable foreign currency translation versus fiscal 2005 the lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower inline net pricing margins in footwear and apparel partially offset by improved yearoveryear hedge rates the lower inline net pricing margins for footwear were due to higher product costs primarily the result of higher oil prices higher sales incentives strategies to improve consumer value and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins the reduced inline net pricing margins for apparel were primarily due to higher product costs and higher sales incentives excluding changes in currency exchange rates selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than in fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage excluding currency changes the increase in selling and administrative costs was driven by higher demand creation expenses partially offset by slightly lower operating overhead expenses the higher demand creation expenses were primarily due to spending related to the world cup campaign and increased spending on retail marketing programs the slightly lower operating overhead expenses were due to lower spending on travel and meeting expenses lower bad debt expense and slightly lower personnel costs related to our wholesale business partially offset by increased spending to support the growth of nikeowned retail stores 

asia pacific region 

 

   

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007 while the majority of countries within the region reported doubledigit sales increases for the year china continues to be the primary driver of growth within the region as revenues increased nearly 26 on a currencyneutral basis the revenue growth in china is primarily due to expansion in both the number of stores selling nike product as well as sales through existing doors constantcurrency revenues in japan increased only slightly during fiscal 2007 despite sustained softness in the japan market we are starting to see positive signs including higher gross margins improvements in sell through at retail and improving futures conversion trends 

the growth in footwear revenue for fiscal 2007 reflected increased unit sales most notably in china and korea partially offset by lower average selling prices which resulted primarily from strategies to improve consumer value in japan and korea combined with a change in the mix of products sold across the region the yearoveryear increase in apparel revenue was also driven by increased demand in china and korea 

the increase in pretax income for the asia pacific region for fiscal 2007 was driven by higher revenues improved gross margins and favorable foreign currency translation which more than offset higher selling and administrative expenses the gross margin improvement versus the prior year was primarily driven by better inventory management improved yearoveryear hedge rates and reduced warehousing costs the improvement in margins was partially offset by higher sales incentives most notably in japan combined with efforts to improve consumer value in japan and korea the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased investments in demand creation most notably the just do it and force basketball campaigns overall business growth across the region combined with retail expansion in china and korea also contributed to an increase in operating overhead expenses 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point for fiscal 2006 excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for each asia pacific product business unit were higher than fiscal 2005 excluding changes in currency exchange rates footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales driven by increased unit sales across most countries and categories partially offset by lower average selling prices due to strategies to improve consumer value in japan the increase in apparel revenues was driven by increases across sport performance and sport culture categories increased revenue in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand was the primary growth driver for fiscal 2006 partially offset by lower sales in japan driven by lower average selling prices due to investments in consumer value and a challenging retail marketplace 

the increase in fiscal 2006 pretax income for the asia pacific region was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage the lower gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower inline net pricing margins due to higher footwear product costs primarily the result of higher oil prices strategies to improve consumer value for footwear in japan and a shift in the mix of footwear and apparel products sold in japan toward products with lower margins selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage the increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in demand creation primarily driven by spending related to the world cup campaign and slightly higher operating overhead primarily due to higher personnel costs to support growth in china 

  

americas region 

 

 fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

in the americas region changes in currency exchange rates contributed 1 percentage point of revenue growth for fiscal 2007 excluding changes in foreign currency exchange rates growth in most markets within the region led by constantcurrency revenue growth of 29 in argentina more than offset softer results in brazil while currencyneutral footwear and equipment revenues increased 6 and 15 respectively versus the prior year apparel revenues decreased 4 as a result of tough world cup comparisons we expect to return to apparel revenue growth in fiscal 2008 as a result of moving from a licensed to a wholesale apparel distribution model in brazil 

the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2007 versus the prior year was primarily attributable to higher revenues and improved gross margins partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses the gross margin improvement was driven by higher inline net pricing margins resulting from fewer discounts being offered in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 combined with a change in product mix the increase in selling and administrative expenses during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to investments in demand creation most notably the run americas ii and women’s fitness campaigns the world cup and retail resources 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

in the americas region 11 percentage points of the revenue growth for fiscal 2006 were due to changes in currency exchange rates even excluding the changes in currency exchange rates sales in each americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2006 the revenue growth was driven by increased sales in every country in the region with significant sales increases in brazil argentina and mexico 

the increase in fiscal 2006 pretax income for the americas region was attributable to higher revenues an improved gross margin percentage lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues and favorable currency translation selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues for fiscal 2006 the increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in both demand creation due to increased sports marketing endorsement contracts and increased advertising spending and retail marketing programs primarily related to the world cup campaign and operating overhead driven by increased personnel costs as a result of continued expansion of the business across the region 

  

other businesses 

 

 we are providing pretax income excluding the converse arbitration to enhance the visibility of the underlying earnings trend excluding these nonrecurring amounts 

fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 

the increase in other business revenues for fiscal 2007 compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by doubledigit revenue growth across nearly all businesses led by converse and nike golf in fiscal 2007 revenues at converse increased more than 20 versus the prior year to over 550 million driven by strong consumer demand in the united states and internationally while nike golf grew 12 to nearly 650 million 

during fiscal 2007 improved profitability at converse driven by increased wholesale revenues in the united states and growth in our international licensing business combined with growth at nike golf contributed to the increase in pretax income versus fiscal 2006 as previously discussed fiscal 2007 results include the benefit of the 142 million settlement of the arbitration ruling involving converse and a former south american licensee as discussed below 

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

revenue increases for our other businesses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 were driven primarily by growth at cole haan converse hurley and nike golf 

pretax income from the other businesses for fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 and included a 519 million charge related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling involving a licensing agreement contract dispute with our converse subsidiary and a former south american licensee this charge reduced reported pretax income for the other businesses by 33 percentage points excluding the converse arbitration charge the pretax income improvement was driven by improved profitability at converse hurley and nike golf partially offset by a loss at nike bauer hockey the loss at nike bauer hockey was largely the result of costs incurred in connection with a rebranding initiative 

liquidity and capital resources 

fiscal 2007 cash flow activity 

cash provided by operations was 19 billion in fiscal 2007 compared to 17 billion in fiscal 2006 our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of 15 billion and noncash depreciation and stockbased compensation offset by investments in working capital and other assets and liabilities to support growth in the business the increase in working capital during fiscal 2007 was primarily attributable to an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities the increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily due to the timing of payments while the increase in inventories reflects yearoveryear growth in reported futures and higher inventories to support the expansion of nikeowned retail stores slightly offset by better inventory management the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year 

  

cash provided by investing activities was 01 billion during fiscal 2007 compared to 13 billion used in investing activities during fiscal 2006 the yearoveryear change was due to a net decrease of 3824 million in shortterm investments during fiscal 2007 compared to a net increase of 9099 million in shortterm investments during fiscal 2006 the decrease in shortterm investments was the result of a strategic shift to highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less 

cash used in financing activities was 11 billion during fiscal 2007 compared to 09 billion used in fiscal 2006 the increase versus fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the 250 million repayment of corporate bonds combined with an increase in share repurchases discussed below partially offset by an increase in notes payable proceeds from the issuance of longterm debt and exercise of stock options 

in fiscal 2007 we purchased approximately 221 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 9753 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2007 40 million of the shares repurchased completed the previous fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program approved by the board of directors in june 2004 as of the end of fiscal 2007 we have repurchased 181 million shares for 8127 million under the new 3 billion program approved by our board of directors in june 2006 we expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2007 were 071 compared to 059 in fiscal 2006 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20 to 30 of the trailing twelvemonths’ earnings per share paid out on a quarterly basis we review our dividend policy from time to time and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of financial accounting standards board “fasb” interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2007 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

 

    

  

  

  

  

 we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2007 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2007 letters of credit of 1659 million were outstanding generally for the purchase of inventory 

capital resources 

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec under which 1 billion in debt securities may be issued in may 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 500 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the mediumterm note program we have issued 2400 million in mediumterm notes 

  

during fiscal 2007 no mediumterm notes were issued under the program we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2008 depending on general corporate needs 

during fiscal 2007 one of the company’s japanese subsidiaries entered into a 30 billion yen approximately 247 million as of may 31 2007 loan facility that replaced certain intercompany borrowings the interest rate on the facility is based on the sixmonth japanese yen london interbank offer rate “libor” plus a spread resulting in an allin rate of 0805 at may 31 2007 the facility expires on december 31 2007 unless both parties agree to an extension 

during fiscal 2007 the company’s same japanese subsidiary entered into a 50 billion yen approximately 411 million as of may 31 2007 term loan that replaces certain intercompany borrowings and matures on february 14 2012 the interest rate on the loan is approximately 15 and interest is paid semiannually 

as of may 31 2007 we had a multiyear 1 billion revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility the facility matures in december 2011 and can be extended for one additional year on both the first and second anniversary date based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 015 the facility fee is 005 of the total commitment 

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facility under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur and set a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2007 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was no amount outstanding at may 31 2007 or may 31 2006 we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since 

  

our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger allowance might be required in the event we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination is made 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

  

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales occur in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property plant and equipment may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded within other income expense net we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or when events indicate that an impairment exists as required by fas 142 in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units our estimates 

  

may change in future periods due to among other things technological change economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinitelived intangible assets would be classified within other income expense net 

intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in these cases we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value any significant impairment charges would be classified within other income expense net 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted “fas 133” have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes significantly we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

stockbased compensation 

as of the first quarter of fiscal 2007 we account for stockbased compensation in accordance with fas 123r under the provisions of fas 123r the fair value of stockbased compensation is estimated on the date of grant using the blackscholes option pricing model the blackscholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including volatility expected volatility is estimated based on implied volatility in market traded options on our common stock with a term greater than one year along with other factors our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility if factors change and we use different assumptions for estimating stockbased compensation expense in future periods stockbased compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

  

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations however if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other income expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party and intercompany transactions 

when we begin hedging exposures the type and duration of each hedge depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months although at may 31 2007 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european subsidiary we use forward contracts to hedge nonfunctional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros british pounds japanese yen korean won canadian dollars and mexican pesos 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 137 million and 175 million at may 31 2007 and may 31 2006 respectively the decrease in var as of may 31 2007 occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of may 31 2007 compared to may 31 2006 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being 

  

hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 365 million and 349 million for fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 respectively 

details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described below these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 

 

 intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties as discussed above 

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by one of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of this subsidiary 

there were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2007 we did not issue any longterm fixedrate corporate bonds during fiscal 2007 or 2006 however in previous years we issued a total of 240 million in longterm fixedrate corporate bonds that mature between july 2007 and october 2015 fixed interest 

  

rates on these bonds range from 47 to 566 for each of the bonds issued we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth libor plus a spread as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 538 at may 31 2007 and 607 at may 31 2006 for 190 million of the issued bonds the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt the remaining 50 million bond matures in october 2013 whereas the associated interest rate swap expired in october 2006 accordingly changes in the fair value of this swap were recorded in net income each period the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net loss of 26 million and 56 million at may 31 2007 and may 31 2006 respectively and a 90 million gain at may 31 2005 the change in fair value of the 50 million interest rate swap that expired in october 2006 was not material for the years ended may 31 2007 2006 and 2005 

in fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3month libor plus a spread under the interest rate swap agreement the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 08 and receives variable interest payments based on 3month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of 80 billion japanese yen this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may 31 2007 2006 and 2005

sales and marketing 

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements on page 68 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

united states market 

in fiscal 2006 sales in the united states including us sales of cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey and nike golf accounted for approximately 47 percent of total revenues compared to 46 percent in fiscal 2005 and 47 percent in fiscal 2004 we sell to approximately 24000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2006 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 30 percent of nike brand sales in the united states excluding sales from nike bauer hockey and nike golf and 25 percent of total sales in the united states

orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2006 were 66 billion compared to 63 billion for the same period last year this futures and advance order amount is calculated based upon our forecast of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although some orders may be cancelled reported futures and advance orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike ihm inc and nike suzhou sports company ltd whollyowned subsidiaries of nike are our largest suppliers of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized 

  

performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” and its predecessor nissho iwai american corporation a subsidiary of nissho iwai corporation a large japanese trading company have performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2006 sojitz america provided such financing services for most of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country however less than 13 percent of nike brand products excluding products produced and sold in the same country were sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan in fiscal 2006 any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2008 

international operations and trade 

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could abate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

as a result of the trade act of 2003 the united states implemented significant new federal requirements for cargo security focused on imports of containerized cargo we are a significant importer of containerized cargo accordingly we participate actively in appropriate governmental programs such as the customs trade partnership against terrorism to reduce risks of possible supply disruptions caused by us and international cargo security mandates and terrorism additionally in 2006 we and a broad coalition of businesses have been actively working with the united states congress as it considers legislation to make us ports more secure we are actively following this proposed legislation and believe that any legislation if passed will not have a significant impact on our supply chain we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position of risk regarding this potential legislation 

all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states the european union and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

footwear imports into the european union 

from 1994 through january 1 2005 the european union “eu” imposed limits or “quotas” on the import of certain types of footwear manufactured in china footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting 

  

certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above nine euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” was excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas did not have a material effect on our business however as part of china’s 2001 accession to the world trade organization “wto” china entered into an agreement with the eu and other wto members to abide by a special safeguard arrangement whereby quotas could be imposed on any product sourced in china including footwear if there was a surge in imports from china into another wto country and after a legal proceeding it was determined that such imports were injuring a domestic producer additionally under longstanding wto rules all wto member countries reserved the right to impose 1 safeguard measures temporary quotas if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that increased imports are injuring another wto member’s domestic industry and 2 antidumping measures if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that imports are being sold at an unfair low price in another wto member’s home market and those imports were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry 

accordingly with the phaseout of the quotas at the beginning of 2005 and the expiration of a separate eu antidumping case in 2003 against footwear made in china indonesia and thailand there has been renewed pressure from some parts of the eu footwear manufacturing sector to reimpose some level of trade protection on imported footwear from china india vietnam and other exporting countries in july 2005 the european commission at the request of the european domestic footwear industry initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam nike and all other major athletic footwear manufacturers are currently participating actively as respondents in this investigation and are taking the position that athletic footwear i should not be within the product scope of this investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation the eu agreed on provisional antidumping duties in march 2006 but excluded staf from the measures we anticipate that the definitive antidumping duties will be adopted by early october 2006 and we expect staf to be excluded from the final measures we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position regarding these potential trade measures 

vietnam imports into the united states 

we currently source a portion of our footwear and apparel products from factories in vietnam in 2001 the united states congress and the vietnamese national assembly approved a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides reciprocal nondiscriminatory normal trade relations “ntr” between the us and vietnam following that approval the us granted an annual extension of ntr to vietnam the us president must renew this grant annually with the opportunity for review by congress in june 2006 president bush renewed ntr for vietnam for an additional year and we anticipate congress will support this decision as it has done for the past five years additionally in the spring of 2006 vietnam finished its wto accession negotiations with several wto countries and has embarked on entering the wto as a full member legislation has been introduced within congress to provide vietnam permanent normal trade relations “pntr” and we anticipate congressional approval of this legislation in 2006 vietnam’s entry into the wto and the us providing vietnam pntr will provide us greater certainty about our business within vietnam it will likewise enable us to further expand our production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamesesourced products to continue to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates 

competition 

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including adidas and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

  

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

trademarks and patents 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air ® patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign patents covering components features and designs used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and have a remaining duration of from now to at least 2026 although the duration of patents varies by country we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

we had approximately 28000 employees at may 31 2006 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees is represented by a union with the exception of nike bauer hockey inc of nike bauer hockey’s employees approximately 37 percent or approximately 183 are covered by three union collective bargaining agreements with three separate bargaining units the collective bargaining agreements expire on various dates from 2007 through 2008 there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 1a risk factors 

special note regarding forwardlooking statements and analyst reports 

certain written and oral statements other than purely historical information including estimates projections statements relating to nike’s business plans objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based made or incorporated by reference from time to time by nike or its representatives in this report other reports filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases conferences or otherwise are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements include without limitation any statement that may predict forecast indicate or imply future results performance or achievements and may contain the words “believe” “anticipate” “expect” “estimate” “project” “will be” “will continue” “will likely result” or words or phrases of similar meaning forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by nike with the sec including forms 8k 10q and 10k and include among others the following international national and local general economic and market conditions the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear 

  

apparel and equipment markets intense competition among designers marketers distributors and sellers of athletic footwear apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers demographic changes changes in consumer preferences popularity of particular designs categories of products and sports seasonal and geographic demand for nike products difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences consumer demand for nike products and the various market factors described above difficulties in implementing operating and maintaining nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls including without limitation the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control interruptions in data and communications systems fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results including without limitation the fact that advance “futures” orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and atonce orders currency exchange rate fluctuations order cancellations and the fact that a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders the ability of nike to sustain manage or forecast its growth and inventories the size timing and mix of purchases of nike’s products new product development and introduction the ability to secure and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property performance and reliability of products customer service adverse publicity the loss of significant customers or suppliers dependence on distributors business disruptions increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings changes in business strategy or development plans general risks associated with doing business outside the united states including without limitation import duties tariffs quotas political and economic instability and terrorism changes in government regulations liability and other claims asserted against nike the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports 

the risks included here are not exhaustive other sections of this report may include additional factors which could adversely affect nike’s business and financial performance moreover nike operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on nike’s business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forwardlooking statements given these risks and uncertainties investors should not place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements as a prediction of actual results 

our products face intense competition 

nike is a consumer products company and the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment we also compete with other companies for the production capacity of independent manufacturers that produce our products and for import quota capacity 

our competitors’ product offerings technologies marketing expenditures including for advertising and endorsements pricing costs of production and customer service are areas of intense competition this plus rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations if we do not adequately and timely anticipate and respond to our competitors our costs may increase or the consumer demand for our products may decline significantly 

if we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new products we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability 

our success depends on our ability to identify originate and define product trends as well as to anticipate gauge and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner all of our products are subject to changing 

  

consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports apparel or away from these types of products altogether and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes if we fail to anticipate accurately and respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products designs styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing we could experience lower sales excess inventories and lower profit margins any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we rely on technical innovation to compete in the market for our products 

although design and aesthetics of our products appear to be the most important factor for consumer acceptance of our products technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment is also essential to the commercial success of our products research and development plays a key role in technical innovation we rely upon specialists in the fields of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields as well as research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts to develop cutting edge performance products while we strive to produce products that help to reduce injury enhance athletic performance and maximize comfort failure to introduce technical innovation in our products could result in a decline in consumer demand for our products 

failure to continue to obtain high quality endorsers of our products could harm our business 

we establish relationships with professional athletes and sports teams and leagues to evaluate and promote our products and establish the authenticity of our products with consumers if certain of our endorsers were to stop using our products contrary to their endorsement agreements our business could be adversely affected in addition actions taken by athletes teams or leagues associated with our products that harm the reputations of those athletes teams or leagues could also harm our brand image with consumers and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition in addition poor performance by our endorsers a failure to continue to correctly identify promising athletes to use and endorse our products or a failure to enter into endorsement arrangements with prominent athletes and sports organizations could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products 

failure of our contractors to comply with our code of conduct local laws and other standards could harm our business 

we contract with hundreds of contractors outside of the united states to manufacture nike brand products and we impose on those contractors a code of conduct and other environmental health and safety standards for the benefit of workers however from time to time contractors may not be in compliance with such standards or applicable local law significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more contractors could harm our reputation and as a result could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition 

our business is affected by seasonality which could result in fluctuations in our operating results and stock price 

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third fiscal quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment in addition our customers may cancel orders change delivery schedules or change the mix of products ordered with minimal notice as a result we may not be able to accurately predict our quarterly sales accordingly our results of operations are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period this seasonality along with other factors that are beyond our 

  

control including general economic conditions changes in consumer preferences weather conditions availability of import quotas and currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our business and cause our results of operations to fluctuate our operating margins are also sensitive to a number of factors that are beyond our control including shifts in product sales mix geographic sales trends and currency exchange rate fluctuations all of which we expect to continue results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 

“futures” orders may not be an accurate indication of our future revenues 

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set period at a fixed price our futures ordering program allows us to minimize the amount of products we hold in inventory purchasing costs the time necessary to fill customer orders and the risk of nondelivery we report changes in futures orders in our periodic financial reports reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of changes in revenues for any future period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

our “futures” ordering program does not prevent excess inventories or inventory shortages which could result in decreased operating margins and harm to our business 

we purchase products from manufacturers outside of our futures ordering program and in advance of customer orders which we hold in inventory and resell to customers there is a risk that we may be unable to sell excess products that we have ordered from manufacturers inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in inventory writedowns and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices could significantly impair our brand image and have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition conversely if we underestimate consumer demand for our products or if our manufacturers fail to supply the products that we require at the time we need them we may experience inventory shortages inventory shortages might delay shipments to customers negatively impact retailer and distributor relationships and diminish brand loyalty 

the difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results of operations and financial condition from period to period a failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely affect our net revenues and net income and we are unlikely to forecast such effects with any certainty in advance 

we may be adversely affected by the financial health of our retailers 

we extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial circumstances generally without requiring collateral to assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of seasonal products we offer customers the ability to place orders five to six months ahead of delivery under our “futures” ordering program these advance orders may be cancelled and the risk of cancellation may increase when dealing with financially ailing retailers or retailers struggling with economic uncertainty in the past some customers have experienced financial difficulties which in turn have had an adverse effect on our business from time to time retailers will be more cautious than usual with orders as a result of weakness in the retail economy a slowing economy in our key markets could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our customers which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business 

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying us and in distinguishing our 

  

goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we believe that our trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights are important to our brand our success and our competitive position we periodically discover products that are counterfeit reproductions of our products or that otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights if we are unsuccessful in challenging a party’s products on the basis of trademark or design infringement continued sales of these products could adversely affect our sales and our brand and result in the shift of consumer preference away from our products the actions we take to establish and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as violations of proprietary rights 

in addition the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states we may face significant expenses and liability in connection with the protection of our intellectual property rights outside the united states and if we are unable to successfully protect our rights or resolve intellectual property conflicts with others our business or financial condition may be adversely affected 

we are subject to periodic litigation and other regulatory proceedings which could result in unexpected expense of time and resources 

we are a defendant from time to time in lawsuits and regulatory actions relating to our business due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation and regulatory proceedings we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings an unfavorable outcome could have an adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations in addition any significant litigation in the future regardless of its merits could divert management’s attention from our operations and result in substantial legal fees 

our international operations involve inherent risks which could result in harm to our business 

virtually all of our athletic footwear and apparel is manufactured outside of the united states and the majority of our products are sold outside of the united states accordingly we are subject to the risks generally associated with global trade and doing business abroad which include foreign laws and regulations varying consumer preferences across geographic regions political unrest disruptions or delays in crossborder shipments and changes in economic conditions in countries in which we manufacture or sell products in addition disease outbreaks terrorist acts and military conflict have increased the risks of doing business abroad these factors among others could affect our ability to manufacture products or procure materials our ability to import products our ability to sell products in international markets and our cost of doing business if any of these or other factors make the conduct of business in a particular country undesirable or impractical our business could be adversely affected in addition many of our imported products are subject to duties tariffs or quotas that affect the cost and quantity of various types of goods imported into the united states and other countries any country in which our products are produced or sold may eliminate adjust or impose new quotas duties tariffs safeguard measures antidumping duties cargo restrictions to prevent terrorism restrictions on the transfer of currency or other charges or restrictions any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the outcomes of an ongoing investigation into antidumping practices in the eu and the annual renewal of the ntr with vietnam each of which are discussed elsewhere in this report could each have a material impact on our business 

currency exchange rate fluctuations could result in higher costs and decreased margins 

a majority of our products are sold outside of the united states as a result we conduct transactions in various currencies which increases our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar our international revenues and expenses generally are derived from sales and operations in foreign currencies and these revenues and expenses could be affected by currency fluctuations including amounts 

  

recorded in foreign currencies and translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting currency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent manufacturers that produce our products by making their purchases of raw materials more expensive and more difficult to finance foreign currency fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

we engage in hedging activities to mitigate the impact of the translation of foreign currencies on our financial results see note 16 to our financial statements risk management and derivatives our hedging activities are designed to reduce and delay but not to eliminate the effects of foreign currency fluctuations factors that could affect the effectiveness of our hedging activities include accuracy of sales forecasts volatility of currency markets and the availability of hedging instruments since the hedging activities are designed to reduce volatility they not only reduce the negative impact of a stronger us dollar but they also reduce the positive impact of a weaker us dollar our future financial results could be significantly affected by the value of the us dollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business the degree to which our financial results are affected for any given time period will depend in part upon our hedging activities 

our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing manufacturing and financing 

the principal materials used in our apparel products — natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture — are available in countries where our manufacturing takes place the principal materials used in our footwear products — natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films — are also locally available to manufacturers nike contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk 

there could be a significant disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or in the event of a disruption we might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price or at all in addition we cannot be certain that our unaffiliated manufacturers will be able to fill our orders in a timely manner if we experience significant increased demand or need to replace an existing manufacturer there can be no assurance that additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or at all or that any supplier or manufacturer would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements in addition even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or sources of materials we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our suppliers and manufacturers in our methods products quality control standards and labor health and safety standards any delays interruption or increased costs in the supply of materials or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower revenues and net income both in the short and long term 

because independent manufacturers manufacture a majority of our products outside of our principal sales markets our products must be transported by third parties over large geographic distances delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation work stoppages port strikes or other factors could adversely impact our financial performance in addition manufacturing delays or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster but more expensive transportation methods such as aircraft which could adversely affect our profit margins the cost of fuel is a significant component in transportation costs so increases in the price of petroleum products can adversely affect our profit margins 

in addition sojitz america performs significant importexport financing services for nearly all of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability 

  

our success depends on our global distribution facilities 

we distribute our products to customers directly from the factory and through distribution centers located throughout the world our ability to meet customer expectations manage inventory complete sales and achieve objectives for operating efficiencies depends on the proper operation of our distribution facilities the development or expansion of additional distribution capabilities and the timely performance of services by third parties including those involved in shipping product to and from our distribution facilities our distribution facilities could be interrupted by information technology problems and disasters such as earthquakes or fires any significant failure in our distribution facilities could result in an adverse affect on our business we maintain business interruption insurance but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse effect that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities 

we rely significantly on information technology in our supply chain and any failure inadequacy interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business 

we are heavily dependent on information technology systems across our supply chain including for design production forecasting ordering manufacturing transportation sales and distribution our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and to ship products to customers on a timely basis depends significantly on the reliability of these supply chain systems over the last several years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in canada and the us emea and asia pacific regions and are now implementing them in the americas regions over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in these operations and complete the implementation of new systems in the remainder of our global operations the failure of these systems to operate effectively problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations and it could require significant capital investments to remediate the problem 

we depend on key personnel the loss of whom would harm our business 

our future success will depend in part on the continued service of key executive officers and personnel the loss of the services of any key individuals could harm us our future success also depends on our ability to identify attract and retain additional qualified personnel competition for employees in our industry is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 

the sale of a large number of shares held by our chairman could depress the market price of our common stock 

philip h knight the chairman of our board of directors beneficially owns over 90 percent of our class a common stock and if it was converted into class b common stock 24 percent of our class b common stock these shares are available for resale subject to the requirements of the us securities laws the sale or prospect of the sale of a substantial number of these shares could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 

antitakeover provisions may impair an acquisition of the company or reduce the price of our common stock 

there are provisions of our articles of incorporation and oregon law that are intended to protect shareholder interests by providing the board of directors a means to attempt to deny coercive takeover attempts or to negotiate with a potential acquirer in order to obtain more favorable terms such provisions include a control share acquisition statute a freezeout statute two classes of stock that vote separately on certain issues and the fact that the holders of class a common stock shares elect threefourths of the board of directors rounded down to the next whole number however such provisions could discourage delay or prevent an unsolicited merger acquisition or other change in control of the company that some shareholders might believe to be in their best interests or in which shareholders might receive a premium for their common stock over the prevailing market price these provisions could also discourage proxy contests for control of the company 

  

we may fail to meet analyst expectations which could cause the price of our stock to decline 

our common stock is traded publicly and at any given time various securities analysts follow our financial results and issue reports on us these reports include information about our historical financial results as well as the analysts’ estimates of our future performance the analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations if our operating results are below the estimates or expectations of public market analysts and investors our stock price could decline in the past securities class action litigation has been brought against nike and other companies following a decline in the market price of their securities if our stock price is volatile we may become involved in this type of litigation in the future any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources that are needed to successfully run our business

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts nikeowned retail stores independent distributors and licensees in the united states and over 160 countries worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear apparel equipment and accessories brands our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas 

 

  

  

  

 by executing this strategy we aim to deliver the following longterm financial goals 

 

  

  

  

 in fiscal 2006 we met most of these financial goals our revenues grew 9 to 15 billion net income grew 15 to 14 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 528 an 18 increase versus fiscal 2005 these reported results included a 519 million charge related to an unfavorable arbitration ruling involving our converse subsidiary see note 5 — accrued liabilities in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the converse arbitration charge excluding this charge our net income grew 17 and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 539 a 20 increase versus fiscal 2005 for fiscal 2006 our consolidated gross margin percentage decreased 50 basis points to 440 primarily due to lower inline net pricing margins net revenue for current product offerings minus product costs partially offset by improvements in yearoveryear currency hedge rates the decline in the gross margin percentage and the converse arbitration charge were more than offset by 80 basis points of selling and administrative expense leverage due entirely to slowing the growth of operating overhead spending and higher interest income resulting in a higher pretax income margin in fiscal 2006 than in fiscal 2005 in addition we increased free cash flow from operations and 

  

continued to return larger amounts of cash to shareholders through higher dividends and increased share repurchases our return on invested capital declined slightly as compared to fiscal 2005 although we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above in any particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year we continue to believe these are appropriate longterm goals 

reconciliation of net income and diluted earnings per share excluding the converse arbitration charge 

 

 we are providing net income and diluted earnings per share results excluding the converse arbitration charge to enhance the visibility of the underlying earnings trend excluding this identifiable expense 

results of operations 

 

 consolidated operating results 

revenues 

 

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

in fiscal 2006 changes in currency exchange rates reduced the reported consolidated revenue growth by 1 percentage point the us region contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006 excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006 as all of our international regions posted higher revenues sales in our other businesses drove the remainder of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2006 revenues for our other businesses are comprised substantially of results from cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey and nike golf 

  

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

in fiscal 2005 3 percentage points of the revenue growth were attributed to changes in currency exchange rates primarily the stronger euro excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth as all of our international regions posted higher revenues the us region contributed 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005 sales in our other businesses drove the remainder of the improvement of consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005 converse was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the comparison of a full year of converse results in fiscal 2005 versus a partial year in fiscal 2004 contributed 1 percentage point to the consolidated revenue growth see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 — acquisitions for additional information related to the acquisition  

gross margin 

 

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

during fiscal 2006 our consolidated gross margin percentage declined 50 basis points versus the prior year the primary factors contributing to the reduced gross margin percentage for fiscal 2006 were as follows 

 

  

 the factors driving a reduced gross margin percentage were partially offset by 

 

  

 fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

during fiscal 2005 our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 160 basis points versus the prior year the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 were as follows 

 

   

  

 selling and administrative expense 

 

  fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

in fiscal 2006 selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues by 80 basis points for the year driven by operating overhead leverage changes in currency exchange rates reduced selling and administrative expense growth by 1 percentage point 

in fiscal 2006 changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in demand creation by 1 percentage point the growth in demand creation spending in fiscal 2006 was in line with our revenue growth the yearoveryear increase in demand creation spending was primarily due to increased spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events increased spending on retail marketing programs instore marketing at our retail partners and advertising primarily around the global world cup and winter olympics campaigns and for the global air max 360 ™ footwear launch 

while consolidated revenues grew 9 in fiscal 2006 operating overhead for fiscal 2006 increased only 4 over fiscal 2005 as a result of expense management strategies to slow the growth of operating overhead spending changes in currency exchange rates reduced the rate of growth in operating overhead by 1 percentage point excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the increase in operating overhead for fiscal 2006 versus fiscal 2005 was mainly attributable to higher personnel costs both increased headcount and higher compensation to support the growth of our business including our other businesses and new nikeowned retail stores 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

in fiscal 2005 3 percentage points of the selling and administrative expense increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates the impact of a full fiscal year for converse and the formation of exeter brands group added 1 percentage point of growth 

in fiscal 2005 3 percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and 

  

events primarily in the us emea and asia pacific regions higher advertising spending primarily in the emea region and increased spending on retail marketing programs in the us emea and asia pacific regions the addition of converse and formation of exeter brands group also contributed to the demand creation increase for the year 

changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of the increase to operating overhead expense in fiscal 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency operating overhead increases for fiscal 2005 were mainly attributable to higher personnel costs both increased headcount and higher compensation investments in emerging markets such as china india and our central europe middle east and africa unit and our other businesses increased costs due to sales and leadership events and higher spending associated with new nikeowned retail stores 

other expense net 

 

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

the significant reduction in other expense net for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily driven by foreign currency hedge gains in fiscal 2006 compared to foreign currency hedge losses in the prior year partially offset by the converse arbitration charge the fiscal 2006 hedge gains primarily reflected that the euro had weakened since we entered into these hedge contracts and are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments and related information  

in fiscal 2006 these net foreign currency hedge gains were partially offset by unfavorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits most significantly in the emea region we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge gains in other expense net and the unfavorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 55 million for fiscal 2006 compared to the prior year 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

the most significant component of other expense net of 291 million for fiscal 2005 was foreign currency hedge losses the hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts in fiscal 2004 foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense net of 747 million the yearoveryear improvement in other expense net for fiscal 2005 was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal 2004 

in fiscal 2005 these net foreign currency losses in other expense net were more than offset by favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits most significantly in the emea region we estimate that the combination of net foreign currency hedge losses in other expense net and the favorable us dollar translation of foreign currency denominated profits resulted in an increase to consolidated income before income taxes of approximately 95 million for fiscal 2005 compared to the prior year 

  

income taxes 

 

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was consistent with the rate reported for fiscal 2005 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 our ceo and board of directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the american jobs creation act of 2004 the “act” to repatriate 500 million of foreign earnings in fiscal 2006 the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an 85 dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations a 500 million repatriation was made during the quarter ending may 31 2006 comprised of both foreign earnings for which us taxes has previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested accordingly the provisions made did not have a material impact on the company’s income tax expense or effective tax rate for the year 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was slightly higher than the fiscal 2004 rate primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal 2005 

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we decided to repatriate 500 million of foreign earnings during fiscal 2006 under the act as discussed above because we elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which us taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 

futures orders 

worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2006 were 50 higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2005 this futures growth rate is calculated based upon our forecasts of the actual exchange rates under which our revenues will be translated during this period which approximate current spot rates the net effect from changes in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on this reported growth versus the same period last year slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed approximately 1 percentage point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders the remaining 4 percentage points of the increase were due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel the reported futures and advance orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations and discounts can cause differences in the comparisons between futures and advance orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures and advance orders including atonce and closeout sales of nike footwear and apparel wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike bauer hockey nike golf and retail sales across all brands

the discussion following includes disclosure of pretax income for our operating segments we have reported pretax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” as discussed in note 17 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements certain corporate costs are not included in pretax income of our operating segments 

us region 

 

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

the increase in footwear revenues was due to a strong increase in unit sales accounting for 12 percentage points of the growth and an increase in the average selling price per pair accounting for 2 percentage points of the growth the strong unit increase was driven by increased consumer demand across a majority of the footwear product categories most significantly high demand for our jordan branded and sport culture products the higher average selling price per pair was primarily due to increased consumer demand for products with a suggested retail price over 100 driven by jordan branded products as well as nike branded sport performance and sport culture products 

the increase in us apparel sales for fiscal 2006 was driven by increased unit sales in nike and jordan branded apparel partially offset by sales declines in licensed apparel primarily due to the expiration of our license agreement with the nba in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 the increases in nike branded apparel were primarily due to increased sales of sport performance products 

for the us region the increase in pretax income for fiscal 2006 as compared to 2005 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage the lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower inline net pricing margins for footwear due to higher product costs primarily the result of higher oil prices and additional costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage the increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead the increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased advertising primarily due to the global campaigns discussed above the increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending for new nikeowned retail stores higher personnel costs and higher travel and meeting expenses 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

the increase in footwear revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in unit sales and a 4 percentage point increase in the average price per pair the increases in unit sales and the average price per pair were due to increased consumer demand for sport performance products especially those with a suggested retail price over 100 

  

the increase in apparel sales for fiscal 2005 was driven by volume increases in branded apparel partially offset by a decline in revenue from sales of licensed apparel the decline in revenue from licensed apparel was due to the expiration of our license agreement with the nba in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and a shift in consumer preference towards branded apparel 

for fiscal 2005 higher revenues an improved gross margin percentage and slightly lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues drove the us region pretax income increase the improved gross margin percentage was primarily the result of fewer more profitable closeout sales partially offset by increased sales discounts the result of increased sales to high volume accounts and higher costs incurred to meet strong footwear unit demand selling and administrative expenses were higher than fiscal 2004 but represented a slightly smaller percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage the increase in selling and administrative costs was due to increases in both demand creation and operating overhead the increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased retail marketing spending the increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending on personnel costs and new nikeowned retail stores and higher costs related to sales and leadership events 

emea region 

 

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

for the emea region changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 4 percentage points in fiscal 2006 excluding changes in currency exchange rates all three product business units grew excluding currency changes the increase in footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales partially offset by declines in the average selling price per pair the increased unit sales were driven by increased demand for sport culture products the declines in the average selling price per pair were due in part to changes in the mix of inline products sold towards products with a lower average selling price and higher sales incentives as a result of a difficult retail environment in western europe the increase in emea apparel revenue was driven by increased unit sales and average selling prices of nike branded apparel primarily increased unit sales of sport performance products including soccer products driven by the world cup and increased average selling prices across most apparel categories excluding changes in currency exchange rates sales increases in the emerging markets of our central europe middle east and africa unit led the revenue growth while sales increases in western and northern europe also contributed to the emea sales growth for fiscal 2006 

the increase in pretax income for the emea region for fiscal 2006 was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues more than offsetting a lower gross margin percentage and unfavorable foreign currency translation versus fiscal 2005 the lower gross margin percentage was primarily the result of lower inline net pricing margins in footwear and apparel partially offset by improved yearoveryear hedge rates the lower inline net pricing margins for footwear were due to higher product costs primarily the result of higher oil prices higher sales incentives strategies to improve consumer value and a shift in the mix of products sold towards products with lower margins the reduced inline net pricing margins for 

  

apparel were primarily due to higher product costs and higher sales incentives excluding changes in currency exchange rates selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than in fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage excluding currency changes the increase in selling and administrative costs was driven by higher demand creation expenses partially offset by slightly lower operating overhead expenses the higher demand creation expenses were primarily due to spending related to the world cup campaign and increased spending on retail marketing programs the slightly lower operating overhead expenses were due to lower spending on travel and meeting expenses lower bad debt expense and slightly lower personnel costs related to our wholesale business partially offset by increased spending to support the growth of nikeowned retail stores 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

for emea changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 7 percentage points of the reported revenue growth in fiscal 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency all three product business units grew excluding currency changes the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear apparel and equipment partially offset by declines in the average prices in each of the product business units for fiscal 2005 excluding the changes in currency exchange rates sales increases in the emerging markets in our central europe middle east and africa unit along with sales increases in the uk and italy drove the growth these increases were partially offset by lower sales in france germany and northern europe 

the increase in pretax income in the emea region in fiscal 2005 was driven by higher revenues and gross margin improvements more than offsetting increased selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues the improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved yearoveryear hedge rates partially offset by reduced inline net pricing margins due to strategies to improve consumer value and higher less profitable closeout sales the result of the liquidation of higher footwear and apparel closeout inventories the increase in selling and administrative expenses was driven by increases in both demand creation and operating overhead the increase in demand creation was primarily driven by increased advertising and higher spending on sports marketing endorsements and events the increase in operating overhead spending was driven by increased spending on personnel costs to support the growth of our wholesale business and new nikeowned retail stores and higher costs related to sales and leadership events

 fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

in the asia pacific region changes in currency exchange rates reduced revenue growth by 1 percentage point for fiscal 2006 excluding the changes in currency exchange rates revenues for each asia pacific product business unit were higher than fiscal 2005 excluding changes in currency exchange rates footwear revenues reflected increased unit sales driven by increased unit sales across most countries and categories partially offset by lower average selling prices due to strategies to improve consumer value in japan the increase in apparel revenues was driven by increases across sport performance and sport culture categories increased revenue in 

  

china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand was the primary growth driver for fiscal 2006 partially offset by lower sales in japan driven by lower average selling prices due to investments in consumer value and a challenging retail marketplace 

the increase in fiscal 2006 pretax income for the asia pacific region was driven by higher revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage the lower gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower inline net pricing margins due to higher footwear product costs primarily the result of higher oil prices strategies to improve consumer value for footwear in japan and a shift in the mix of footwear and apparel products sold in japan toward products with lower margins selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2006 were higher than fiscal 2005 but represented a lower percentage of revenues due to operating overhead leverage the increased selling and administrative expenses were due to increases in demand creation primarily driven by spending related to the world cup campaign and slightly higher operating overhead primarily due to higher personnel costs to support growth in china 

fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 

in the asia pacific region 4 percentage points of reported revenue growth for fiscal 2005 were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding changes in currency exchange rates sales in each asia pacific product business unit grew versus fiscal 2004 with the growth primarily due to unit volume average price per unit increased slightly excluding currency changes significant revenue increases in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and increases in every other country in the region except australia and new zealand were the key growth drivers for fiscal 2005 

the increase in pretax income for the asia pacific region in fiscal 2005 was driven by higher revenues partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased selling and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues the reduced gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to less profitable closeout sales and lower inline net pricing margins due to strategies to improve the consumer value in japan partially offset by better yearoveryear currency hedge rates the increase in selling and administrative expenses was due to increases in both demand creation driven by higher spending on sports marketing endorsements and events and increased spending on retail marketing programs and operating overhead driven by increased spending on personnel costs to support the growth of our business and higher costs related to sales and leadership events

fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 

revenue increases for our other businesses in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 were driven primarily by growth at cole haan converse hurley and nike golf 

pretax income from the other businesses for fiscal 2006 was consistent with fiscal 2005 and included a 519 million charge related to the unfavorable arbitration ruling involving a licensing agreement contract dispute with our converse subsidiary and a former south american licensee this charge reduced reported pretax income for the other businesses by 34 percentage points excluding the converse arbitration charge the pretax income improvement was driven by improved profitability at converse hurley and nike golf partially offset by a loss at nike bauer hockey the loss at nike bauer hockey was largely the result of costs incurred in connection with a rebranding initiative

cash provided by operations was 17 billion in fiscal 2006 compared to 16 billion in fiscal 2005 our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of 14 billion for fiscal 2006 our net investment in working capital increased 432 million as compared to an increase of 130 million in fiscal 2005 this increased investment in working capital was largely attributable to a larger increase in inventories and prepaid expenses and other current assets partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities the increase in inventories reflects higher intransit inventories due primarily to growth in reported futures and other orders and earlier product ordering compared to last year and higher inventories to support the expansion of nikeowned retail stores prepaid expenses and other current assets increased in fiscal 2006 compared to a decrease in the prior year primarily due to the timing of payments including earlier payments of income taxes in certain foreign locations the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is primarily due to the timing of payments and inventory receipts compared to the prior year 

cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2006 was 13 billion compared to 3604 million invested during fiscal 2005 the increase over the prior year was primarily due to a higher net increase in shortterm investments purchases net of maturities which increased from 353 million in fiscal 2005 to 9099 million in fiscal 2006 and increased net additions to property plant and equipment the additions to property plant and equipment primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software to support both normal business operations and our supply chain systems upgrade and continued investment in nikeowned retail stores 

in fiscal 2006 we purchased approximately 95 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 7812 million the share repurchases were part of a fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in june 2004 since the inception of this program we have repurchased 164 million shares at a total cost of 13 billion in june 2006 the board of directors approved a new fouryear 30 billion share repurchase program to commence upon completion of the 15 billion share repurchase program we expect to fund share repurchases from operating cash flow excess cash andor debt the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the programs will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2006 were 118 compared to 095 in fiscal 2005 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20 to 30 of the trailing twelvemonths’ earnings per share paid out on a quarterly basis we review our dividend policy from time to time and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 

offbalance sheet arrangements 

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and 

  

disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations 

contractual obligations 

our longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2006 are as follows 

 

   

  

  

 excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through fiscal 2008 the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may 31 2006 we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of 187 million our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate 6 million 

  

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2006 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

 

 as of may 31 2006 letters of credit of 3476 million were outstanding generally for the purchase of inventory most letters of credit expire within one year 

capital resources 

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” under which 1 billion in debt securities may be issued in may 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 500 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements and since commencement of the mediumterm note program we have issued 2400 million in mediumterm notes during fiscal 2006 there were no mediumterm notes issued under the program we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2007 depending on general corporate needs 

as of may 31 2006 we had a multiyear 750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility the maturity date is november 20 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 018 the facility fee is 007 of the total commitment 

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur and set a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2006 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was no amount outstanding at may 31 2006 or may 31 2005 we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

recently issued accounting standards 

in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” 

  

“fas 151” fas 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges the provisions of fas 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2006 we have evaluated the provisions of fas 151 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

on december 16 2004 the fasb finalized sfas no 123r “share based payment” “fas 123r” which after the sec amended the compliance dates on april 15 2005 is effective for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2006 the new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method on march 29 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 “sab 107” which provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between fas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies 

we plan to adopt the new requirements under fas 123r and sab 107 beginning in our first quarter of fiscal 2007 using the modified prospective transition method and the blackscholes fair value model as a result of the adoption of fas 123r we will recognize additional compensation expense of approximately 036 per diluted share in fiscal 2007 the amount of expense that will be recognized is largely dependent on several variables including the level of sharebased payments that will be granted during the fiscal year in addition to the assumptions used in the valuation model accordingly the actual effect per diluted share could differ from this estimate the effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options for fiscal 2006 2005 and 2004 using the blackscholes model is presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — significant accounting policies 

under certain conditions stock options granted by the company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee the fasb clarified in fas 123r that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on the applicable accelerated vesting schedule rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement the sec clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of fas 123r then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement had we been accounting for such stock options using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement we would have recognized additional stockbased compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — significant accounting policies of 001 per diluted share in fiscal 2006 and 005 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 and 2004 we usually grant the majority of stock options in a single grant in the first three months of each fiscal year as a result accelerated vesting will normally result in higher expense in the first three months and lower expense in the last nine months of each fiscal year as compared to the pro forma expense we disclosed under our current policy of expensing such options ratably over the stated vesting period 

in june 2006 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” “fin 48” fin 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 109 “accounting for income taxes” the provisions of fin 48 are effective for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2007 we are currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fin 48 

critical accounting policies 

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

  

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three fiscal quarters 

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

revenue recognition 

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 

we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger reserve might be required in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 

inventory reserves 

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our 

  

inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

property plant and equipment 

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property plant and equipment may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded as other expense net we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

in accordance with sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” “fas 142” goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in 

  

the fourth fiscal quarter or when events indicate that an impairment exists as required by fas 142 in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units our estimates may change in future periods due to among other things technological change economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and any impairment charge related to other indefinitelived intangible assets would be classified as other expense net 

intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in these cases we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value any impairment charges would be classified as other expense net 

hedge accounting for derivatives 

we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted “fas 133” have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes significantly we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

taxes 

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

  

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

other contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations however if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party and intercompany transactions 

when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months although at may 31 2006 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries we use forward contracts to hedge 

  

nonfunctional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros japanese yen korean won canadian dollars and mexican pesos 

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk “var” our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year period the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 175 million and 257 million at may 31 2006 and may 31 2005 respectively the decrease in var as of may 31 2006 occurred due to a lower notional value of outstanding foreign currency derivative instruments as of may 31 2006 compared to may 31 2005 such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 349 million and 372 million for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 respectively 

  

details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described below these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 

 

 intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties as discussed above 

  

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 

there were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2006 we did not issue any longterm fixedrate corporate bonds during fiscal 2006 or 2005 however in previous years we issued a total of 490 million in longterm fixedrate corporate bonds that mature between august 2006 and october 2015 fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 47 to 566 for each of the bonds issued we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth libor plus a spread as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 607 at may 31 2006 and 417 at may 31 2005 for 440 million of the issued bonds the associated swaps have the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt the remaining 50 million bond matures in october 2013 whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in october 2006 accordingly changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net 56 million loss at may 31 2006 and a 90 million gain at may 31 2005 the change in fair value of the 50 million interest rate swap expiring october 2006 was not material for the years ended may 31 2006 2005 and 2004 

in fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3month libor plus a spread under the interest rate swap agreement the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 08 and receives variable interest payments based on 3month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion japanese yen this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period the change in fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may 31 2006 2005 and 2004

sales and marketing 

  financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements on page 60 

  we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year historically revenues in the first and fourth fiscal quarters have slightly exceeded those in the second and third quarters however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

  because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 

united states market 

  in fiscal 2005 sales in the united states including us sales of bauer nike hockey cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley and nike golf accounted for approximately 46 percent of total revenues compared to 47 percent in fiscal 2004 and 49 percent in fiscal 2003 we sell to approximately 22000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2005 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 31 percent of nike brand sales in the united states excluding sales from nike golf and bauer nike hockey and 26 percent of total sales in the united states 

  we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal year 2005 91 percent of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding bauer nike hockey cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley and nike golf were made under the futures program compared to 90 percent in fiscal 2004 and 91 percent in fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2005 and 2004 71 percent of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley and nike golf were made under the futures program compared to 67 percent in 2004 and 2003 

3   we utilize 22 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 9 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf and outdoor activities in addition we sell nike brand products through our internet website wwwniketowncom  and we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

   nike’s domestic distribution centers for footwear are located in wilsonville oregon and memphis tennessee apparel and equipment products are shipped from our memphis tennessee tigard oregon and foothill ranch california distribution centers cole haan and bauer nike hockey products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire converse products are shipped from ontario and fontana california and hurley products are shipped from costa mesa california 

international markets 

  we sell our products to retail accounts through nikeowned retail stores and through a mix of independent distributors and licensees in over 160 countries around the world nonus sales including nonus sales of bauer nike hockey cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley and nike golf accounted for 54 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2005 compared to 53 percent in fiscal 2004 and 51 percent in fiscal 2003 we estimate that we sell to more than 37000 retail accounts outside the united states excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees we operate 21 distribution centers in europe asia australia latin america africa and canada in many countries and regions including canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 12 percent of nonus sales 

  we operate the following retail outlets outside the united states 

   international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina australia austria belgium brazil bulgaria canada chile croatia czech republic denmark finland france germany greece hong kong hungary indonesia india ireland israel italy japan korea lebanon malaysia mexico new zealand the netherlands norway people’s republic of china the philippines poland portugal russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sri lanka sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and vietnam 

significant customer 

  foot locker inc which operates a chain of retail stores specializing in athletic footwear and apparel accounted for approximately 11 percent of global net sales of nike inc during fiscal 2005 no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales during fiscal 2005 

orders 

  worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2005 were 63 billion compared to 57 billion for the same period last year based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although some orders may be cancelled reported futures orders are not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenues for this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

product research and development 

  we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that help to reduce injury aid athletic performance and maximize comfort 

  in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes and other athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

manufacturing 

  virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2005 contract suppliers in china vietnam indonesia and thailand manufactured 36 percent 26 percent 22 percent and 15 percent of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india italy mexico and south africa to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries our largest single footwear supplier accounted for approximately 7 percent of total fiscal 2005 footwear production 

  almost all of nike brand apparel production for sale to the united states market and all of our apparel production for sale to the international market was manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 38 countries most of this apparel production occurred in bangladesh china honduras india indonesia malaysia mexico pakistan sri lanka taiwan thailand turkey and vietnam our largest single apparel supplier accounted for approximately 5 percent of total fiscal 2005 apparel production 

  the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike is our sole supplier of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

  since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” and its predecessor nissho iwai american corporation a subsidiary of nissho iwai corporation a large japanese trading company have performed significant importexport financing services for us during fiscal 2005 sojitz america provided such financing services for nearly all of the nike brand products sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan excluding products produced and sold in the same country however less 

5 than 11 percent of nike brand products excluding products produced and sold in the same country were sold outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan in fiscal 2005 any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe middle east africa and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2008 

international operations and trade 

  our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could abate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

  as a result of the trade act of 2003 the united states implemented significant new federal requirements for cargo security focused on imports of containerized cargo we are a significant importer of containerized cargo accordingly we participate actively in appropriate governmental programs such as the customs trade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” to reduce risks of possible supply disruptions caused by us and international cargo security mandates and terrorism 

  all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states the european union and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below 

footwear imports into the european union 

  from 1994 through january 1 2005 the european union “eu” imposed limits or “quotas” on the import of certain types of footwear manufactured in china footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above 9 euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” was excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas did not have a material effect on our business however as part of china’s 2001 accession to the world trade organization “wto” china entered into an agreement with the eu and other wto members to abide by a special safeguard arrangement whereby quotas could be imposed on any product sourced in china including footwear if there was a surge in imports from china into another wto country and after a legal proceeding it was determined that such imports were injuring a domestic producer additionally under longstanding wto rules all wto member countries reserved the right to impose 1 safeguard measures temporary quotas if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that increased imports are injuring another wto member’s domestic industry and 2 antidumping measures if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that imports are being sold at an unfair low price in another wto member’s home market and those imports were causing or threatening to cause material injury to the domestic industry 

6   accordingly with the phaseout of the quotas at the beginning of 2005 and the expiration of a separate eu antidumping case in 2003 against footwear made in china indonesia and thailand there has been renewed pressure from some parts of the eu footwear manufacturing sector to reimpose some level of trade protection on imported footwear from china india vietnam and other exporting countries in mid2005 the european commission at the request of the european domestic footwear industry initiated investigations into leather footwear imported from china and vietnam nike and all other major athletic footwear manufacturers are currently participating actively as respondents in this investigation and are taking the position that athletic footwear i should not be within the product scope of this investigation and ii does not meet the legal requirements of injury and price in an antidumping investigation we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position of risk regarding these potential trade measures 

   under the wto the multifiber arrangement a fourdecade old agreement that allows wto countries to impose quotas on the import of textile and apparel products expired on january 1 2005 this effectively meant that absent some other form of trade restrictions see china discussion below all trade of textile and apparel products between wto members is free from quotas as of the end of the 2004 calendar year elimination of textile and apparel quotas is significant for nike and other textile and apparel companies as it provides these companies greater flexibility in their global sourcing decisions at the same time we are monitoring closely actions by textile and apparel importing countries to ensure that they do not unilaterally attempt to reimpose restrictions through some other legal mechanism such as safeguards antidumping measures or in the case of china as part of the agreement reached in china’s 2001 wto accession through the shortterm reimposition of quotas on certain categories of textile and apparel products in order to protect a domestic market from rising chinese imports 

  we are currently monitoring potential restrictions by the united states and the european union in early 2005 the eu began consultations with china over imposition of quotas however as a result of those negotiations in june of 2005 the eu and china reached an agreement which voluntarily limits the amount of apparel product china can export to the eu in particular categories until january 1 2008 nike monitored these negotiations closely adjusted its sourcing and distribution strategy and as a result the agreement has not had a material effect on our business 

  in early 2005 the united states launched provisional safeguard measures on several categories of apparel products from china in may of 2005 the us found that imports from china of certain apparel categories were causing market disruption to the us industry and the united states reimposed quota on certain apparel categories nike monitored these negotiations closely adjusted its sourcing and distribution strategy and as a result the actions have not had a material effect on our business we believe that our principal competitors face the same risks regarding these trade measures 

   we currently source a portion of our footwear and apparel products from factories in vietnam in 2001 the united states congress and the vietnamese national assembly approved a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides reciprocal nondiscriminatory normal trade relations “ntr” between the us and vietnam following that approval the us granted an annual extension of ntr to vietnam the us president must renew this grant annually with the opportunity for review by congress in june 2005 president bush renewed ntr for vietnam for an additional year and we anticipate congress will support this decision as it has done for the past four years we currently believe that absent unforeseen circumstances the president will continue his annual extensions of ntr to vietnam and that congress will support the president’s decisions the annual extensions on ntr will remain in place until vietnam enters the wto at which time the us must grant vietnam permanent ntr vietnam’s wto accession negotiations are ongoing and may conclude as early as the end of 2005 ongoing ntr trading status for vietnam will allow us to expand our production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamesesourced product to continue to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates 

competition 

  the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including reebok adidas and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

  nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

trademarks and patents 

  we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike® and swoosh design® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

  nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign patents covering components features and designs used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and have a remaining duration of from now to at least 2025 although the duration of patents varies by country we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

employees 

  we had approximately 26000 employees at may 31 2005 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees is represented by a union with the exception of bauer nike hockey inc of bauer nike hockey’s employees approximately 33 percent or approximately 157 are covered by two union collective bargaining agreements with two separate bargaining units the collective bargaining agreements expire on various dates from 2005 through 2007 there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend overview 

  nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts nikeowned retail stores independent distributors and licensees in the united states and over 160 countries worldwide our goal is to deliver value to our shareholders by building a profitable portfolio of global footwear apparel equipment and accessories brands our strategy for building this portfolio is focused in four key areas 

   by executing this strategy we aim to deliver the following longterm financial goals 

 14   in fiscal 2005 we met or surpassed these financial goals our revenues grew 12 to 137 billion net income grew 28 to 12 billion and we delivered diluted earnings per share of 448 a 28 increase versus fiscal 2004 the impact of foreign currency changes has had a favorable impact on this year’s consolidated results of operations primarily as a contributor to the growth in our gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 our consolidated gross margin percentage increased 160 basis points to 445 additionally we have improved our return on invested capital increased free cash flow from operations and continued to return cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases although in any particular quarter or fiscal year we may not meet all of the financial goals outlined above we continue to believe these are appropriate longterm goals 

results of operations 

 

 

   in fiscal 2005 consolidated revenues grew 12 versus fiscal 2004 three percentage points of this growth is attributed to changes in currency exchange rates primarily the stronger euro excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency revenue growth in our international regions contributed 4 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth as all three of our international regions posted higher revenues the us region contributed 3 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005 sales in our other businesses operating segment drove the remainder of the improvement of consolidated revenue growth for fiscal 2005 converse a component of the other businesses was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 the comparison of a full year of results in fiscal 2005 versus a partial year in fiscal 2004 contributed 1 percentage point to the consolidated revenue growth see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 — acquisitions for additional information related to the acquisition  

  during fiscal 2005 our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 160 basis points versus the prior year from 429 to 445 the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2005 were as follows 

 15  

 we have hedged the majority of product purchases for fiscal 2006 and a significant portion of those are at more favorable rates than product purchases in fiscal 2005 based on these hedge rates we expect hedge rates to have a positive impact on our gross margin percentage during fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 with the greater impact occurring during the first half of the year see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 16 — risk management and derivatives for additional information on hedges 

 

   fiscal 2005 selling and administrative expense comprised of demand creation and operating overhead grew 14 versus fiscal 2004 three percentage points of the increase for fiscal 2005 were due to changes in currency exchange rates the impact of a full fiscal year for converse and the formation of exeter brands group added one percentage point of growth 

  demand creation advertising and promotion expense grew 16 to 16007 million in fiscal 2005 three percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on sports marketing endorsement contracts and events primarily in the us emea and asia pacific regions 5 percentage points higher advertising spending primarily in the emea region 3 percentage points and incremental investment in retail marketing in the us emea and asia pacific regions 2 percentage points the addition of converse and formation of exeter brands group contributed 2 percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year 

  operating overhead for fiscal 2005 was 26210 million a 13 increase over fiscal 2004 changes in currency exchange rates contributed 3 percentage points of the increase excluding the effects of foreign currency operating overhead increases for fiscal 2005 were mainly attributable to higher personnel costs due to increased headcount higher wages and benefits and increased incentivebased compensation for employees 4 percentage points investments in emerging markets such as china india and our central europe middle east and africa unit and our other businesses 3 percentage points increased costs due to sales and leadership events 2 percentage points and investments in nikeowned retail stores 1 percentage point 

16   the most significant component of other expense net of 291 million for fiscal 2005 was foreign currency hedge losses these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments and related information the hedge losses reflect that the euro has strengthened since we entered into these hedge contracts in fiscal 2004 foreign currency hedge losses were also the most significant component of other expense net of 747 million the yearoveryear improvement in other expense net for fiscal 2005 was mainly due to lower foreign currency hedge losses and lower net losses on asset disposals compared to those recorded in fiscal 2004 

  in 2005 net foreign currency losses in other expense net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits most significantly in emea our estimate of the combined impact of lower foreign currency conversion losses and the favorable translation of foreigncurrency denominated profits is a 95 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year if current exchange rates remain constant we do not expect a significant impact on our consolidated income before income taxes related to foreign currency gains or losses and the offsetting translation for fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 

  our effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 349 which is slightly higher than the fiscal 2004 rate of 348 primarily due to decreases in tax credits partially offset by lower taxes on foreign earnings in fiscal 2005 

  during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 we decided to repatriate 500 million of foreign earnings during fiscal 2006 under the american jobs creation act the “act which was signed into law by the president on october 22 2004 the act creates a temporary incentive for us multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned outside the us by providing an 85 dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations we elected to repatriate a combination of foreign earnings for which us taxes had previously been provided and foreign earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested accordingly the provisions made did not have a material impact on our income tax expense or our effective tax rate for the year 

  worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2005 were 95 higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2004 approximately 1 point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year excluding this currency impact slightly higher average selling prices for both footwear and apparel contributed 1 point of the growth in overall futures and advance orders the remaining increase was due to volume increases for both footwear and apparel as always the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan converse exeter brands group hurley nike golf and retail sales across all brands 

   the breakdown of revenues follows 

  

   the discussion following includes disclosure of “pretax income” for our operating segments we have reported pretax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” as discussed in note 17 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements certain corporate costs are not included in pretax income of our operating segments 

  for emea changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 7 percentage points of the reported revenue growth in fiscal 2005 excluding the effects of foreign currency emea region revenues grew 5 percent as each product business unit footwear apparel and equipment experienced growth the following analysis excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased unit sales of footwear apparel and equipment partially offset by declines in the average prices in each of the business units although apparel and equipment business units experienced growth for fiscal 2005 revenues fell slightly in the fourth quarter primarily due to comparisons to very strong sales in the prior year’s fourth quarter related to the 2004 european football championships for fiscal 2005 sales increases in the emerging markets in our central europe middle east and africa unit along with sales increases in the uk and italy drove the growth these increases were partially offset by lower sales in france germany and northern europe 

18   for the emea region futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november 2005 were 7 percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal 2004 changes in currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of this growth excluding the changes in currency exchange rates the growth was driven by an increase in the region’s footwear and apparel unit orders and increases in apparel’s average price these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the region’s footwear average price per pair partially due to strategies to improve the product value 

  emea pretax income for fiscal 2005 was 9175 million up 23 versus the prior year higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase more than offsetting increased selling and administrative costs the improved gross margins which contributed 90 basis points of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage were primarily the result of improved yearoveryear hedge rates partially offset by reduced inline pricing margins and higher less profitable closeout sales 

  in the asia pacific region 4 percentage points of reported revenue growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates the following analysis excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency sales in each asia pacific product business unit grew versus fiscal 2004 with the growth primarily due to unit volume average price per unit increased slightly significant revenue increases in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and increases in every other country in the region except australia and new zealand were the key growth drivers for fiscal 2005 

  for the asia pacific region futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november 2005 were 11 percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal 2004 changes in currency exchange rates contributed 2 percentage points of this growth excluding the changes in currency exchange rates the growth was driven by an increase in the region’s footwear and apparel unit orders these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the region’s average selling price per unit for footwear and apparel 

  pretax income for the asia pacific region increased 13 versus fiscal 2004 to 3998 million higher revenues were partially offset by a lower gross margin percentage and increased selling and administrative costs the reduced gross margin percentage which had a minimal negative impact on the net overall consolidated gross margin percentage change was primarily attributable to less profitable closeout sales and reduced inline pricing margins due to strategies to improve the product value partially offset by better yearoveryear currency hedge rates 

  in the americas region 1 percentage point of the revenue growth for fiscal 2005 was due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency sales in each americas product business unit grew in fiscal 2005 the revenue growth was driven primarily by higher sales in central and south america partially offset by lower sales in canada 

  in fiscal 2005 pretax income for the americas region increased 21 from the prior year to 1176 million the increase in pretax income was attributable to higher revenues and an improved gross margin percentage partially offset by higher selling and administrative costs the improved gross margin percentage had a minimal impact on the consolidated gross margin percentage improvement 

  in the us region revenues for fiscal 2005 grew 7 versus fiscal 2004 as revenues increased in each product business unit the increase in footwear revenue was due to a 5 percentage point increase in unit sales and a 4 percentage point increase in the average price per pair the increases in unit sales and the average price per pair are due to increased consumer demand for performance products especially those with a suggested retail price over 100 

  the increase in apparel sales for fiscal 2005 was driven by volume increases in branded apparel partially offset by a decline in revenue from sales of licensed apparel the decline in revenue from licensed apparel was due to the expiration of our license agreement with the nba in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 and a shift in consumer preference towards branded apparel for the first quarter and into the second quarter of fiscal 2006 we expect revenues generated by licensed apparel to be below the prior year levels due to the expiration of the agreement with the nba 

19   for the us region futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november 2005 increased 9 percentage points versus the same period of the prior year futures orders increased due to unit growth for both footwear and apparel and higher average price per pair for footwear as discussed above these reported futures do not cover all components of our overall revenues such as us licensed apparel expected to decrease as noted above equipment closeouts atonce orders and retail sales as a result revenue growth for the us region for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 is expected to be below the reported futures growth 

  for fiscal 2005 pretax income for the us region was 11258 million a 12 increase versus fiscal 2004 higher revenues and improved gross margin percentage drove the increase more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs the improved gross margin percentage contributed 30 basis points of growth to the consolidated gross margin percentage growth and was primarily the result of fewer more profitable closeouts partially offset by increased discounts and higher product costs and air freight incurred to meet strong footwear demand 

  revenues and pretax income for our other businesses in fiscal 2005 include results from bauer nike hockey inc cole haan holdings incorporated converse inc hurley international llc nike golf and exeter brands group llc exeter brands group llc is a wholly owned subsidiary of nike inc formed in the first quarter of fiscal 2005 to develop the company’s business in retail channels serving valueconscious consumers and to operate the business obtained in the acquisition of official starter properties llc and official starter llc collectively “official starter” for fiscal 2005 the addition of converse acquired in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and the formation of exeter brands group together drove 12 percentage points of the other business revenue increase of 22 over fiscal 2004 the remainder of the increase was driven by revenue growth at cole haan nike golf and hurley 

  pretax income from the other businesses improved to 1539 million in fiscal 2005 versus income of 753 million in fiscal 2004 the yearoveryear improvement was driven by the addition of converse improved results from cole haan and bauer and the formation of the exeter brands group 

 

   in fiscal 2004 consolidated revenues grew 15 versus fiscal 2003 seven percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates primarily the stronger euro excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency revenue growth in our international regions contributed 3 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth and all three of our international regions posted higher revenues with our asia pacific region making the largest contribution converse which was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth improved sales in the us region and increases in our other businesses drove the balance of the consolidated revenue growth 

  during fiscal 2004 our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 190 basis points versus the prior year from 410 to 429 the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 were as follows 

 20  

   fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expense grew 17 versus fiscal 2003 demand creation expense grew 18 to 13779 million in fiscal 2004 seven percentage points of the increase in demand creation were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on endorsement contracts in the us primarily basketball 3 percentage point impact incremental investment in retail marketing in the us emea and asia pacific regions 3 percentage point impact and higher advertising spending in the asia pacific region 1 percentage point impact the addition of converse contributed 2 percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year 

  operating overhead for fiscal 2004 was 23241 million a 17 increase over fiscal 2003 currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of the increase the addition of converse accounted for 2 percentage points of growth other key factors driving the increase in operating overhead for the fiscal year were a increased incentivebased compensation for employees 3 percentage points and b increased costs to support the growth of our nike golf cole haan bauer nike hockey and hurley businesses 2 percentage points the remaining increase about 5 percentage points is primarily attributable to normal wage increases and some added infrastructure necessary to support global business growth including costs related to our worldwide supply chain initiative and additional factory outlet stores in the emea region 

  other expense net was 747 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 775 million in fiscal 2003 in both years the most significant component of other expense net was foreign currency hedge losses the hedge losses reflect that the euro strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts also included in other expense net for fiscal 2004 was an increase in net losses on asset disposals including a loss of 53 million on land gifted to the nike foundation in the first quarter 

  in 2004 net foreign currency losses in other expense net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits most significantly in emea our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a 157 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year 

  our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 348 which is higher than the fiscal 2003 rate of 341 as a result of a higher tax provision on foreign earnings in fiscal 2004 

  included in net income for fiscal 2003 was a 2661 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 142 this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 4 — identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 

   for emea changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 17 percentage points of the reported increase in revenues in fiscal 2004 the remaining increase over the prior year was primarily driven by nikeowned retail due to the addition of new stores in fiscal 2004 and increased footwear volume led by soccer products excluding the impact of currency exchange movements sales in each emea business unit grew versus fiscal 2003 

  emea pretax income for fiscal 2004 was 7440 million up 43 versus the prior year higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase more than offsetting incremental selling and 

21 administrative costs the improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved yearoveryear hedge rates and higher inline and closeout pricing margins 

  in the asia pacific region fiscal 2004 revenues increased 20 yearoveryear eight percentage points of growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the impact of currency exchange movements sales in each asia pacific business unit grew versus fiscal 2003 the region’s revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases with significant revenue growth in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and japan driven by strong consumer demand 

  pretax income for the asia pacific region increased to 3523 million in fiscal 2004 up 22 versus fiscal 2003 higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs the higher gross margins were primarily attributable to higher inline pricing margins and the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases partially offset by lower profitability of closeouts 

  in the americas region revenues increased 19 compared to fiscal 2003 with 8 percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the currency effects the revenue growth was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in south america and sales in each americas business unit grew versus fiscal 2003 

  in fiscal 2004 pretax income for the americas region increased 6 from the prior year to 974 million the increase in pretax income was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates slightly offset by reduced gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs gross margins fell due to lower inline pricing margins as well as weaker currency exchange rates in mexico 

  in the us region revenues for fiscal 2004 grew 3 versus fiscal 2003 as revenues increased in each business unit the increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in sport performance product and increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel primarily in the first half of fiscal 2004 

  the increase in footwear revenue was due to an increase in average wholesale selling price per pair and increased sales in nikeowned retail stores partially offset by a slight decline in wholesale unit sales the increase in average wholesale selling price per pair was partially due to a larger percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over 100 the slight decline in us footwear wholesale unit sales was largely due to changes in distribution to several retail customers for the first half of the year sales to our largest customer foot locker were lower as a result of changes to our distribution strategy implemented in fiscal 2002 and 2003 while the decline in first half sales resulted in slightly lower sales for the full year our yearoveryear sales to foot locker grew in the second half of fiscal 2004 in addition fiscal 2004 sales declined for another large customer footstar which declared bankruptcy in march 2004 the sales declines for foot locker and footstar were partially offset by increased sales to other accounts 

  for fiscal 2004 pretax income for the us region was 10073 million a 6 increase versus fiscal 2003 higher revenues and gross margins drove the increase more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs the improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher inline and closeout pricing margins and expanded retail margins 

  revenues for other businesses grew 45 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the addition of converse contributed 23 percentage points of the increase the remainder of the increase was due to revenue growth at nike golf cole haan hurley and bauer nike hockey 

  pretax income for other businesses improved to 753 million in fiscal 2004 versus income of 79 million in fiscal 2003 the addition of converse combined with improved results from nike golf and cole haan drove the yearoveryear improvement 

22 liquidity and capital resources 

   cash provided by operations was 16 billion in fiscal 2005 compared to 15 billion in fiscal 2004 our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of 12 billion in fiscal 2005 cash provided by operations was not significantly affected by the net change in working capital in fiscal 2004 a net decrease in working capital provided 1932 million in cash flow primarily due to improved cash management of our accounts receivable and timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments 

  cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2005 was 3604 million compared to 9506 million invested during fiscal 2004 the most significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2005 were net additions to property plant and equipment of 250 million and a net increase in shortterm investments purchases partially offset by the maturities the additions to property plant and equipment reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software to support both normal business operations and our supply chain systems upgrade and continued investment in nikeowned retail stores the improvement over the prior year was primarily due to lower net purchases of shortterm investments and lower costs associated with the acquisition of subsidiaries 

  in fiscal 2005 and since inception of our current share repurchase program we purchased approximately 69 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 5562 million the share repurchases were part of a fouryear 15 billion share repurchase program that was approved by the board of directors in june 2004 we expect to continue to fund this program from operating cash flow the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

  dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2005 were 095 compared to 074 in fiscal 2004 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 our current dividend policy is to provide an annual dividend equal to 20 to 30 of the trailing twelvemonths’ earnings per share paid out on a quarterly basis we review our dividend policy from time to time and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 

   our longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2005 are as follows 

  

 23  

   excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through fiscal 2006 the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may 31 2005 we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of 134 million our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate 7 million subsequent to may 31 2005 we extended this contract through fiscal 2008 with substantially the same terms as noted above however the termination fee increased to approximately 19 million upon execution of the renewed contract and our estimated monthly payments decreased to approximately 6 million 

  we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2005 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

   as of may 31 2005 letters of credit of 5550 million were outstanding primarily for the purchase of inventory all letters of credit generally expire within one year 

   in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” under which 1 billion in debt securities may be issued in may 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 500 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements during fiscal 2005 there were no mediumterm notes issued under the program in previous years 2400 million in mediumterm notes were issued under the program currently 760 million remains available to be issued under the shelf registration we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2006 depending on general corporate needs 

  as of may 31 2005 we had a multiyear 750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility the maturity date is november 20 

24 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 018 the facility fee is 007 of the total commitment 

  if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur and set a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2005 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

  liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was no amount outstanding at may 31 2005 or may 31 2004 we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

  we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

recently issued accounting standards 

  in november 2004 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 151 “inventory costs an amendment of arb no 43 chapter 4” fas 151 fas 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities excess freight and handling costs and wasted materials spoilage are required to be recognized as current period charges the provisions of sfas no 151 are effective for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2006 we are currently evaluating the provisions of fas 151 and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  on december 16 2004 the fasb finalized sfas no 123r “share based payment” fas 123r which after the securities and exchange commission sec amended the compliance dates on april 15 2005 will be effective for our fiscal year beginning june 1 2006 the new standard will require us to record compensation expense for stock options using a fair value method on march 29 2005 the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 107 sab 107 which provides the staff’s views regarding interactions between fas 123r and certain sec rules and regulations and provides interpretations of the valuation of sharebased payments for public companies 

  we are currently evaluating fas 123r and sab 107 to determine the fair value method to measure compensation expense the appropriate assumptions to include in the fair value model and the transition method to use upon adoption the impact of the adoption of fas 123r is not known at this time due to these factors as well as the unknown level of sharebased payments granted in future years the effect on our results of operations of expensing stock options using the blackscholes model is presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — significant accounting policies 

  under certain conditions stock options granted by the company are eligible for accelerated vesting upon the retirement of the employee the fasb clarified in fas 123r that the fair value of such stock options should be expensed based on an accelerated vesting schedule or immediately rather than ratably over the vesting period stated in the grant our pro forma disclosure currently reflects the expense of such options ratably over the stated vesting period expensing all unvested shares upon actual retirement the sec has recently clarified that companies should continue to follow the vesting method they have been using until adoption of fas 123r then apply the accelerated vesting schedule to all subsequent grants to those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement had we been accounting for such stock options 

25 using the accelerated vesting schedule for those employees eligible for accelerated vesting upon retirement we would have recognized additional stockbased compensation expense in our pro forma disclosure of the effect of expensing stock options presented in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 1 — significant accounting policies of 005 per diluted share in fiscal 2005 2004 and 2003 

critical accounting policies 

  our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

  we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 

  within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

   we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

  in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

  in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

  as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

   we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future 

26 changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger reserve might be required in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 

   we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

   a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

  some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

  some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

  some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

   property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

  when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property plant and equipment may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded as other expense net we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted 

27 cash flows may change in future periods due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

   we adopted fas 142 effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 in accordance with fas 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or when events indicate that an impairment exists as required by fas 142 in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units our estimates may change in future periods due to among other things technological change economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 

  as discussed further above upon adoption of fas 142 in fiscal 2003 we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2661 million this charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change subsequent to adoption any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense net 

  intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in these cases we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value any impairment charges would be classified as other expense net 

   we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative and hedging activities” as amended and interpreted fas 133 have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes significantly we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

   we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss 

28 carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 

  in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have determined to be indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

  we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings determined to be reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in a determination that accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided will be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

  on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to the yeartodate pretax income excluding significant or infrequently occurring items to determine the yeartodate tax expense the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the interim period in which they occur as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

   in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations however if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend   in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

  we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge 

29 certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party or intercompany transactions 

  when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months although at may 31 2005 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 24 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries we use forward contracts to hedge nonfunctional currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in euros japanese yen canadian dollars korean won australian dollars and mexican pesos 

  our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps 

market risk measurement 

  we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk var our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

  we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variance covariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on nonfunctional currency transactions such as anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable including those which are hedged by these instruments 

  the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

  the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 257 and 249 million at may 31 2005 and may 31 2004 respectively the increase in var as of may 31 2005 occurred due to a larger portfolio of foreign currency derivative instruments which was largely offset by the effect of lower currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2005 var computation versus the may 31 2004 var computation such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 372 million and 500 million for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 respectively 

30   details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described below these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in nonfunctional currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 

 31   intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts with third parties as discussed above 

  the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 

  there were no significant changes in debt market risks during fiscal 2005 we did not issue any longterm fixedrate corporate bonds during fiscal 2005 however during fiscal 2002 2003 and fiscal 2004 we issued a total of 490 million in longterm fixedrate corporate bonds that mature between august 2006 and october 2015 fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 47 to 566 for each of the bonds issued in fiscal 2002 2003 and fiscal 2004 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth libor plus a spread as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 417 at may 31 2005 and 24 at may 31 2004 each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond except for one swap for a 50 million bond issued in fiscal 2004 the 50 million bond issued in fiscal 2004 matures in october 2013 whereas the associated interest rate swap expires in october 2006 these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt except for the 50 million swap expiring in october 2006 which is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net 90 million gain at may 31 2005 and a 33 million gain at may 31 2004 the recorded fair value of the 50 million interest rate swap expiring october 2006 was not material for the years ended may 31 2005 and 2004 

  in fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3month libor plus a spread under the interest rate swap agreement the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 08 and receives variable interest payments based on 3month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion japanese yen this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period the recorded fair value of the swap was not material for the years ended may 31 2005 2004 and 2003

our principal business activity is the design development and worldwide marketing of high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world we sell our products to retail accounts and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and subsidiaries in over 120 countries around the world virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors virtually all footwear and apparel products are produced outside the united states while equipment products are produced both in the united states and abroad 

  

products 

  

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovative design for men women and children running basketball children’s crosstraining and women’s shoes are currently our topselling product categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future however we also market shoes designed for outdoor activities tennis golf soccer baseball football bicycling volleyball wrestling cheerleading aquatic activities hiking and other athletic and recreational uses 

  

we sell active sports apparel covering most of the above categories athletically inspired lifestyle apparel as well as athletic bags and accessory items nike apparel and accessories are designed to complement our athletic footwear products feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar design or for specific purposes we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos

sales and marketing 

  

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements on page 57 

  

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

  

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk failure to timely and adequately respond could have a material adverse affect on our sales and profitability 

  

united states market 

  

during fiscal 2004 sales in the united states including us sales of cole haan bauer nike hockey hurley nike golf and converse accounted for approximately 47 percent of total revenues compared to 49 percent in fiscal 2003 and 53 percent in fiscal 2002 we sell to approximately 28000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2004 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 26 percent of nike brand sales in the united states excluding sales from nike golf and bauer nike hockey and 23 percent of total sales in the united states 

  

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal year 2004 90 percent of our us wholesale footwear shipments excluding cole haan bauer nike hockey hurley nike golf and converse were made under the futures program compared to 91 percent in fiscal 2003 and 92 percent in fiscal 2002 in fiscal 2004 and 2003 67 percent of our us wholesale apparel shipments excluding us licensed team apparel cole haan bauer nike hockey hurley nike golf and converse were made under the futures program compared to 69 percent in 2002 

  

we utilize 21 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 10 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf cycling water sports and outdoor activities in addition we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

  

   

nike’s domestic distribution centers for footwear are located in wilsonville oregon memphis tennessee and greenland new hampshire apparel and equipment products are shipped from our memphis tennessee tigard oregon and foothill ranch california distribution centers cole haan and bauer nike hockey products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire converse products are shipped from ontario and fontana california and hurley products are shipped from costa mesa california 

  

international markets 

  

we sell our products in over 120 countries outside of the united states through retail accounts independent distributors licensees subsidiaries and branch offices nonus sales including nonus sales of cole haan bauer nike hockey hurley nike golf and converse accounted for 53 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2004 compared to 51 percent in fiscal 2003 and 47 percent in fiscal 2002 we operate 23 distribution centers in europe asia australia latin america africa and canada and also distribute through independent distributors and licensees we estimate that we sell to more than 23000 retail accounts outside the united states excluding sales by independent distributors and licensees in many countries and regions including japan canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 13 percent of nonus sales 

  

we operate the following retail outlets outside the united states 

  

   

international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina australia austria belgium brazil bulgaria canada chile croatia czech republic denmark finland france germany hong kong hungary indonesia india ireland israel italy japan korea lebanon malaysia mexico new zealand the netherlands norway peoples republic of china the philippines poland portugal russia singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sri lanka sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and vietnam 

  

orders 

  

worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2004 were 56 billion compared to 50 billion for the same period last year based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although some orders may be cancelled futures orders are not necessarily indicative of future sales trends this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan converse nike golf hurley and retail sales across all brands 

  

product research and development 

  

we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that reduce injury aid athletic performance and maximize comfort 

  

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

  

manufacturing 

  

virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2004 contract suppliers in china indonesia vietnam and thailand manufactured 36 percent 24 percent 22 percent and 16 percent of total nike brand footwear respectively we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india mexico and south africa to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries our largest single footwear supplier accounted for approximately 7 percent of total fiscal 2004 footwear production 

  

almost all of nike brand apparel production for sale to the united states market was manufactured outside of the united states by independent contract manufacturers located in 37 countries most of this apparel production occurred in bangladesh china greece honduras india indonesia malaysia mexico pakistan the philippines sri lanka taiwan thailand and turkey all of our apparel production for sale to the international market was manufactured outside the us our largest single apparel supplier accounted for approximately 5 percent of total fiscal 2004 apparel production 

  

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike is our sole supplier of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

  

since 1972 sojitz corporation of america “sojitz america” and its predecessor nissho iwai american corporation a subsidiary of nissho iwai corporation a large japanese trading company that recently merged with nichimen corporation have performed significant importexport financing services for us currently sojitz 

  

america provides such financing services with respect to at least 80 of the nike products sold outside of the united states europe and japan approximately 12 of nike products are sold outside of the united states europe and japan any failure of sojitz america to provide these services or any failure of sojitz america’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with sojitz america expire on may 31 2005 

  

international operations and trade 

  

our international operations and sources of supply are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures trade restrictions restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability and terrorism we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could abate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that much of the adverse impact on supply would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

  

as a result of the trade act of 2003 the united states has implemented significant new federal requirements for cargo security focused on imports of containerized cargo we are a significant importer of containerized cargo accordingly we participate actively in appropriate governmental programs such as the customs trade partnership against terrorism “ctpat” to reduce risks of possible supply disruptions caused by us and international cargo security mandates and terrorism 

  

all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties antidumping duties quotas safeguard measures or other trade restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future such actions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole accordingly we are actively monitoring the developments described below

in 1994 the european commission “eu” imposed quotas on certain types of footwear manufactured in china these quotas replaced national quotas that had previously been in effect in several european member states footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above 9 euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” has been excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas have not to date had a material effect on our business in addition the eu has confirmed that footwear quotas will be eliminated globally beginning january 1 2005 however as part of china’s 2001 accession to the world trade organization “wto” china entered into an agreement with the eu and other wto members to abide by a special safeguard arrangement whereby quotas could be imposed on any product sourced in china including footwear if there was a surge in imports from china into another wto country and after a legal proceeding it was determined that such imports were injuring a domestic producer additionally under longstanding wto rules all wto member countries reserve the right to impose 1 safeguard measures 

  

temporary quotas if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that increased imports are injuring another wto member’s domestic industry and 2 antidumping measures if it can be demonstrated in a legal proceeding that imports are being sold at an unfair low price in another wto member’s home market 

  

accordingly with the phaseout of the quotas at the beginning of 2005 and the expiration of a separate eu antidumping case in 2003 against footwear made in china indonesia and thailand there may be renewed pressure from some sectors within europe to reimpose some level of trade protection on imported footwear while it is unlikely that the eu will pursue any such action we will monitor the circumstances closely and if action is initiated we will work to mitigate any significant business risks we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position of risk regarding these potential trade measures 

  

on may 1 2004 ten new countries joined the eu and the eu single market an agreement was reached to increase the current eu quotas on footwear to account for the enlarged eu market nike and other manufacturers do not expect this expansion of the eu single market to present any significant challenges to the importation into the eu of sports footwear produced in china since the eu increased quotas take into account the enlarged consumer and market demand 

  

if eu trade measures become substantially more restrictive we would consider shifting to the extent possible the production of our sports footwear to other countries in order to maintain competitive pricing and access to these markets we believe that we are prepared to deal effectively with any such change of circumstances and that any adverse impact would be of a temporary nature we continue to closely monitor international restrictions and maintain our multicountry sourcing strategy and contingency plans we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks regarding these trade measures 

  

imports into the united states 

  

we currently source a portion of our footwear and apparel products from factories in vietnam in 2001 the united states congress and the vietnamese national assembly approved a comprehensive bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides reciprocal nondiscriminatory normal trade relations “ntr” between the us and vietnam following that approval the us granted an annual extension of ntr to vietnam the us president must renew this grant annually with the opportunity for review by congress in june 2004 president bush renewed ntr for vietnam for an additional year and we anticipate congress will support this decision we currently believe that absent unforeseen circumstances the president will continue his annual extensions of ntr to vietnam and that congress will support the president’s decisions the annual extensions on ntr will remain in place until vietnam enters the wto at which time the us must grant vietnam permanent ntr vietnam’s wto accession negotiations are ongoing and may conclude as early as the end of 2005 ongoing ntr trading status for vietnam will allow us to expand our production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamesesourced product to continue to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates 

  

expiration of the textile and apparel multifiber arrangement 

  

under the wto the multifiber arrangement a fourdecade old agreement that allows wto countries to impose quotas on the import of textile and apparel products will expire on january 1 2005 this effectively means that all trade of textile and apparel products between wto members will be free from quotas at the end of the 2004 calendar year elimination of textile and apparel quotas is significant for nike and other textile and apparel companies as it provides these companies greater flexibility in their global sourcing decisions at the same time we are monitoring closely actions by textile and apparel importing countries to ensure that they do not unilaterally attempt to reimpose restrictions through some other legal mechanism such as safeguards antidumping measures or in the case of china as part of the agreement reached in china’s 2001 wto accession through the shortterm reimposition of quotas on certain categories of textile and apparel products in order to 

  

protect a domestic market from surging chinese imports in the event of any significant protectionist trade actions we will evaluate alternative sourcing options and will work to mitigate any significant business risks we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks regarding these potential trade measures 

  

competition 

  

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including reebok adidas and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

  

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

  

trademarks and patents 

  

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

  

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air patents will not expire for several years we also have hundreds of us and foreign patents covering components features and designs used in various athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment these patents expire at various times and have a remaining duration of from now to at least 2024 although the duration of patents varies by country we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

  

employees 

  

we had approximately 24667 employees at may 31 2004 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union with the exception of bauer nike hockey inc of bauer nike hockey’s north american employees approximately 47 percent or approximately 232 are covered by three union collective bargaining agreements with three separate bargaining units and all of bauer nike hockey’s approximately 130 nonimmigrant employees in italy are covered by three collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreements expire on various dates from 2005 through 2007 there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

overview 

  

nike designs develops and markets high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products worldwide we are the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world and sell our products primarily through a combination of retail accounts in the united states and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and subsidiaries in over 120 countries our goal is to deliver value to five constituencies shareholders consumers business partners employees and the community we aim to deliver that value by focusing on our mission … 

  

to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world 

  

if you have a body you are an athlete 

  

and building our capabilities in four key areas 

  

   

   

   

   

we believe we can create value for our shareholders in striving for the following key longterm financial goals 

  

   

   

   

   

in fiscal 2004 we met or surpassed these goals primarily through a combination of revenue growth and gross margin improvements across our businesses management of working capital and share repurchases in addition the impact of foreign currency changes has had a significant favorable impact on this year’s financial results although in any particular quarter or even annual period we may not meet some or all of the financial goals outlined above we believe these are appropriate goals for the longer term 

  

results of operations 

  

   

fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 

  

consolidated operating results 

  

in fiscal 2004 consolidated revenues grew 15 percent versus fiscal 2003 seven percentage points of this growth can be attributed to changes in currency exchange rates primarily the stronger euro excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency revenue growth in our international regions contributed 3 percentage points to the consolidated revenue growth and all three of our international regions posted higher revenues with our asia pacific region making the largest contribution converse which was acquired at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2004 contributed 2 percentage points of consolidated revenue growth see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 15 — acquisition for additional information related to the acquisition  improved sales in the us region and increases in our other businesses drove the balance of the consolidated revenue growth 

  

during fiscal 2004 our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 190 basis points versus the prior year from 410 to 429 the primary factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

   

fiscal 2004 selling and administrative expense comprised of demand creation and operating overhead grew 17 versus fiscal 2003 demand creation advertising and promotion expense grew 18 to 13779 million in fiscal 2004 seven percentage points of the increase in demand creation was due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency rates the increase in demand creation spending for the fiscal year was attributable to higher spending on endorsement contracts in the us primarily basketball 3 percentage point impact incremental investment in retail marketing in the us emea and asia pacific regions 3 percentage point impact and higher advertising spending in the asia pacific region 1 percentage point impact the addition of converse contributed 2 percentage points of the demand creation increase for the year 

  

operating overhead for fiscal 2004 was 23241 million a 17 increase over fiscal 2003 currency exchange rates contributed 5 percentage points of the increase the addition of converse accounted for 2 percentage points of growth other key factors driving the increase in operating overhead for the fiscal year were a increased incentivebased compensation for employees 3 percentage points and b increased costs to support the growth of our nike golf cole haan bauer nike hockey and hurley businesses 2 percentage points the remaining increase about 5 percentage points is primarily attributable to normal wage increases and some added infrastructure necessary to support global business growth including costs related to our worldwide supply chain initiative and additional factory outlet stores in the emea region 

  

over the last five years as part of the ongoing initiative to upgrade our worldwide supply chain we have implemented new systems in canada the us and emea regions and are now implementing them in japan southeast asia and our hong kong apparel operations over the next few years we will work to continue to enhance the systems and related processes in these operations and complete the implementation of new systems in the remainder of our global operations this initiative is intended to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions improve margins by lowering the volume of closeout inventories and distribution costs including inbound air freight and improve cash flow by reducing inventories and accounts receivable through better visibility in the us and emea regions where the new systems have been in place for over a year we have begun to see improvements in several key performance measures including gross margins see above and cash flows see below the ultimate level of benefit to revenues margins and cash flows will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented in the remaining countries in which we operate and globally integrated in subsequent years at fiscal year end approximately 80 percent of nike’s businesses had completed implementation of the new systems during the period of implementation operating overhead expense will continue to include both the cost of implementing and operating new systems and the cost of supporting the legacy systems we anticipate completing the majority of the remaining implementations over the next two years 

  

other expense net was 747 million for fiscal 2004 compared to 775 million in fiscal 2003 beginning this fiscal year interest income and profit sharing expense previously included in other expense net are included in interest expense net and selling and administrative expense respectively the presentation of prior year amounts has been adjusted to conform to the current classification the most significant components of other expense net comprising approximately 64 percent of this year’s net expense and 79 percent of fiscal 2003’s net expense was foreign currency losses primarily hedge losses on intercompany charges to a european subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro and hedge losses from that subsidiary’s investments in us dollar denominated debt securities availableforsale these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment 

  

presentation of pretax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 17 — operating segments and related information  the hedge losses reflect that the euro has strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts also included in other expense net for fiscal 2004 was an increase in net losses on asset disposals including a loss of 53 million on land gifted to the nike foundation in the first quarter 

  

in 2004 net foreign currency losses in other expense net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits most significantly in emea our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a 157 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes compared to the prior year consistent with our existing policies in fiscal 2005 we have continued to hedge a portion of anticipated intercompany charges and investments in us dollar denominated debt securities availableforsale we expect the net impact of any hedge losses or gains and the offsetting translation impact will result in a significantly lower net benefit to fiscal 2005 than was realized in fiscal 2004 

  

our effective tax rate for fiscal 2004 was 348 which is higher than the fiscal 2003 rate of 341 as a result of a higher tax provision on foreign earnings in fiscal 2004 

  

included in net income for fiscal 2003 was a 2661 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 142 this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 4 — identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 

  

worldwide futures and advance orders for footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2004 were 113 higher than such orders reported for the comparable period of fiscal 2003 one point of this reported increase was due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year excluding this currency impact higher average selling prices for footwear across all regions contributed 3 points of the growth in overall futures and advance orders the remaining increase was due to volume increases for both apparel and footwear on our june 24 2004 press release we reported that worldwide futures and advance orders for this period were up 107 as compared to last year our futures program permits changes to orders for a short period of time following the order deadline such changes to orders most notably in the us and asia pacific regions increased the growth in worldwide futures for the june through november period by 06 percentage points to 113 as always the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenue is not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan converse nike golf hurley and retail sales across all brands 

  

operating segments 

  

the breakdown of revenues follows 

  

   

the discussion following includes disclosure of “pretax income” for our operating segments we have reported pretax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” as discussed in note 17 — operating segments and related information in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  certain corporate costs are not included in pretax income of our operating segments 

  

for emea our largest international region changes in foreign currency exchange rates accounted for 16 percentage points of the reported increase in revenues in fiscal 2004 the remaining increase over the prior year was primarily driven by nikeowned retail due to the addition of new stores in fiscal 2004 and increased footwear volume led by soccer product excluding the impact of currency exchange movements sales in each emea business unit footwear apparel equipment grew versus fiscal 2003 

  

after several years in which the region’s revenues grew substantially faster than the overall market in europe fiscal 2004 revenue growth for emea was more in line with the growth of the overall market futures orders for the region scheduled for delivery from june through november 2004 were 9 percentage points higher than such orders received for the comparable period of fiscal 2003 changes in currency exchange rates accounted for about 3 percentage points of this growth an increase in the region’s footwear average price per pair contributed to this futures order growth  

  

emea pretax income for fiscal 2004 was 7507 million up 41 versus the prior year higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs the improved gross margins were primarily the result of improved yearoveryear hedge rates and higher inline and closeout pricing margins 

  

in the asia pacific region fiscal 2004 revenues increased 20 yearoveryear eight percentage points of growth for the fiscal year were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the impact of currency exchange movements sales in each asia pacific business unit grew versus fiscal 2003 the region’s revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases with significant revenue growth in china driven by expansion of retail distribution and strong consumer demand and japan driven by strong consumer demand 

  

pretax income for the asia pacific region increased to 3549 million in fiscal 2004 up 21 versus fiscal 2003 higher revenues and gross margin improvements drove the increase more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs the higher gross margins were primarily attributable to higher inline pricing margins and the benefit of better hedge rates on product purchases partially offset by lower profitability of closeouts 

  

in the americas region revenues increased 19 compared to fiscal 2003 with 8 percentage points of the growth due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the currency effects the revenue growth was driven primarily by stronger consumer demand in south america and sales in each americas business unit grew versus fiscal 2003 

  

in fiscal 2004 pretax income for the americas region increased 6 from the prior year to 1019 million the increase in pretax income was attributable to changes in currency exchange rates slightly offset by reduced gross margins and higher selling and administrative costs gross margins fell due to lower inline pricing margins as well as weaker currency exchange rates in mexico 

  

in the us region revenues for fiscal 2004 grew 3 versus fiscal 2003 as revenues increased in each business unit the increase in apparel sales was primarily driven by growth in sport performance product and increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel primarily in the first half of fiscal 2004 

  

the increase in footwear revenue was due to an increase in average wholesale selling price per pair and increased sales in nikeowned retail stores partially offset by a slight decline in wholesale unit sales the increase in average wholesale selling price per pair was partially due to a larger percentage of sales of products with a suggested retail price over 100 the slight decline in us footwear wholesale unit sales was largely due to changes in distribution to several retail customers for the first half of the year sales to our largest customer foot locker were lower as a result of changes to our distribution strategy implemented in fiscal 2002 and 2003 while the decline in first half sales resulted in slightly lower sales for the full year our yearoveryear sales to foot locker grew in the second half of fiscal 2004 in addition fiscal 2004 sales declined for another large customer footstar which declared bankruptcy in march 2004 the sales declines for foot locker and footstar were partially offset by increased sales to other accounts 

  

for the us region futures orders scheduled for delivery from june through november 2004 increased 11 percentage points versus the prior year higher orders from foot locker were a factor in this increase during our fiscal fourth quarter foot locker acquired additional stores from footstar further as announced in november 2003 additional premium product offerings were made available to select foot locker locations beginning with the fall 2004 season growth in futures orders from foot locker as compared to the prior year’s orders from foot locker and footstar combined contributed 3 percentage points of the overall region’s futures orders growth additionally futures orders grew as a result of increases in average wholesale selling price per pair for footwear due to increased orders for products with a suggested retail price over 100 

  

for fiscal 2004 pretax income for the us region was 10151 million a 5 increase versus fiscal 2003 higher revenues and gross margins drove the increase more than offsetting higher selling and administrative costs the improved gross margins were primarily the result of higher inline and closeout pricing margins and expanded retail margins 

  

the other segment includes results from bauer nike hockey inc cole haan holdings incorporated converse inc hurley international llc and nike golf revenues for other grew 51 in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 the addition of converse contributed 24 percentage points of the increase the remainder of the increase was due to revenue growth at nike golf cole haan hurley and bauer nike hockey 

  

pretax income for other improved to 753 million in fiscal 2004 versus income of 52 million in fiscal 2003 the addition of converse combined with improved results from nike golf and cole haan drove the yearoveryear improvement 

  

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

  

consolidated operating results 

  

revenue growth in our international regions drove the 8 increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro contributed 4 percentage points of the consolidated revenue growth 

  

in fiscal 2003 our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 170 basis points as compared to fiscal 2002 from 393 to 410 significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage were as follows 

  

   

   

lower pricing of nike golf products as a result of market conditions discussed below partially offset these positive margin drivers changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as the benefit of stronger hedge rates in some currencies was offset by weaker hedge rates in other currencies 

  

selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from 287 in fiscal 2002 to 295 in fiscal 2003 both demand creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues demand creation expense grew from 10279 million in fiscal 2002 to 11668 million in fiscal 2003 higher costs incurred in the emea region drove the growth in demand creation expense reflecting 1 a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the us dollar which resulted in higher us dollar expenses for costs that are eurodenominated 2 our new endorsement agreement with the manchester united soccer team that became effective in august 2002 and 3 costs of our world cup marketing campaign incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 higher demand creation expenses were also incurred in the asia pacific and americas regions due to the world cup marketing campaign we also increased demand creation spending in the us in order to drive continued consumer demand for footwear while we realigned our distribution to retail customers 

  

operating overhead increased from 18079 million in fiscal 2002 to 19873 million in fiscal 2003 major drivers of this increase were the stronger euro exchange rate incremental costs related to our ongoing development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain primarily reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in note 17 — operating segments and related information  investments in headcount for our nike golf business the addition of hurley overhead costs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and overhead costs of additional retail stores in the emea and asia pacific regions 

  

interest expense net decreased from 340 million in fiscal 2002 to 288 million in fiscal 2003 a decline of 15 the decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels as we have used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt 

  

other expense net was 775 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 12 million in fiscal 2002 significant amounts included in other expense net were goodwill amortization fiscal 2002 only and certain foreign currency gains and losses 

  

an increase in net foreign currency losses was the largest contributor to the increase in other expense net for fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 these foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges to a european subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  note 17 — operating segments and related information  the hedge losses reflected that the euro had strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts in fiscal 2003 net foreign currency losses in other expense net were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation was a 13 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes 

  

our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was 341 relatively consistent with the fiscal 2002 effective rate of 343 

  

included in fiscal 2003 net income was a 2661 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing fas 142 this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values in addition the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a reduction to goodwill and intangible asset amortization of 131 million as compared to fiscal 2002 see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 4 — identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 

  

operating segments 

  

our largest international region emea reported 20 revenue growth in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 this growth reflected a 15 percentage point improvement due to changes in currency exchange rates growth in the emerging markets in central and eastern europe was the key driver of the balance of the increase as our distribution continued to expand in these markets and customer demand increased excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates each of our emea business units delivered revenue growth versus the prior year 

  

emea pretax income grew from 4224 million in fiscal 2002 to 5320 million in fiscal 2003 higher revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 

  

in asia pacific revenues increased 19 in fiscal 2003 five percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates sales in each asia pacific business unit grew in fiscal 2003 as did sales in almost every country of the region particularly japan and korea driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for our products following the 2002 world cup and our related marketing campaign and china driven primarily by an expansion of retail distribution of our products 

  

pretax income for the asia pacific region increased from 2162 million in fiscal 2002 to 2926 million in fiscal 2003 this increase reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more than offset higher selling and administrative costs 

  

in the americas region fiscal 2003 revenues decreased 7 compared to fiscal 2002 reflecting higher sales in local currencies that were more than offset by a 15 percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates this currency exchange impact was due to weaker currencies in the latin american markets partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar excluding the currency exchange rate impact the region 

  

experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit on a geographic basis excluding currency exchange rate impacts the region experienced sales growth in brazil argentina and mexico reflecting stronger consumer demand the sales growth in argentina reflected a rebound since fiscal 2002 when that country underwent an economic crisis 

  

pretax income for the americas region grew from 921 million in fiscal 2002 to 965 million in fiscal 2003 pretax income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage 

  

in the us region revenues were down slightly in fiscal 2003 at 46584 million versus 46696 million in fiscal 2002 us footwear revenues were down 4 more than offsetting sales growth in us apparel and equipment us apparel sales increased 953 million primarily driven by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel lower revenues in the footwear business unit were largely the result of a significant change in our us footwear distribution 

  

during fiscal 2003 we began a realignment of our us footwear distribution to address the changing retail marketplace including our largest customer’s foot locker reduction in emphasis on premium footwear in its offerings the objectives of this realignment were to improve the presentation and profitability of the nike brand in the us as a result of changes in both foot locker’s orders and our product offerings to this account our fiscal 2003 sales to foot locker in the us were significantly below the level of fiscal 2002 at the same time we expanded the premium products available to other athletic specialty and independent retailers that focus on premium footwear offerings increasing sales to these accounts significantly 

  

our unit sales of footwear in the us increased slightly as compared to fiscal 2002 however this volume increase was more than offset by a decline in the average price per pair of footwear sold the reduction in average price per pair in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 reflected a higher percentage of sales of classic footwear and kids’ models which have a lower average price than our more complex adult performance models 

  

us region pretax income increased from 9560 million in fiscal 2002 to 9632 million in fiscal 2003 pretax income improved despite lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense due to improved gross margins 

  

revenues for other grew 12 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the addition of revenues from our hurley business purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 drove the increase in other revenues 

  

pretax income for other declined from 437 million in fiscal 2002 to 52 million in fiscal 2003 reduced profitability at nike golf drove this decline reflecting significantly weaker demand in the us golf market versus fiscal 2002 and startup issues we experienced at a thirdparty distribution facility 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

fiscal 2004 cash flow activity 

  

cash provided by operations was 15 billion in fiscal 2004 compared to 9220 million in fiscal 2003 our primary source of operating cash flow was net income of 9456 million in addition to the improvement in net income the increase in cash compared to the prior year was attributable to changes in our investment in working capital primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable excluding the acquisition of converse and the effects of foreign currency which were reported separately in fiscal 2004 accounts receivable provided cash to the company due to improved account management through better utilization of supply chain systems especially in emea accounts payable provided cash to the company due to the timing of inventory receipts and vendor payments the changes in other working capital components were consistent with normal business operations 

  

cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2004 was 9465 million compared to 2156 million invested during fiscal 2003 the most significant uses of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2004 were the 

  

purchase of shortterm investments and the acquisition of converse which accounted for 4008 million and 2891 million respectively the remaining investing activities are consistent with the prior year and primarily reflect capital expenditures on computer equipment and software to support both normal business operations as well as our supply chain systems upgrade continued investment in nikeowned retail stores and construction of a storage facility in japan which was completed in fiscal 2004 

  

cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2004 was 3985 million down from 6065 million in the prior year in fiscal 2004 the principal uses of cash for financing activities were share repurchases payments of longterm debt and dividends offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and debt issuance net cash used by financing activities was higher in fiscal 2003 primarily due to increased repayments of shortterm debt in that period 

  

the share repurchases were part of a 10 billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2004 we repurchased 64 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 4143 million completing the program over the course of the fouryear program we purchased a total of 187 million shares of nike’s class b common stock in june 2004 the board of directors approved a new 15 billion share repurchase program to be completed over the next four years we expect to continue to fund the new program from operating cash flow the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

  

dividends declared per share of common stock for fiscal 2004 were 074 compared to 054 in fiscal 2003 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 we review our dividend policy from time to time and based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 

  

contractual obligations 

  

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2004 are as follows 

  

    

   

   

   

excluded from the table above is a commitment to an outsourcing contractor that provides us with information technology operations management services through 2006 the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may 31 2004 we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of 187 million our monthly payments to the contractor currently approximate 6 million 

  

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2004 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

  

   

as of may 31 2004 letters of credit of 5516 million were outstanding primarily for the purchase of inventory all letters of credit generally expire within one year 

  

capital resources 

  

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission “sec” under which 1 billion in debt securities may be issued in may 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 500 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements during fiscal 2004 we issued five notes under the mediumterm note program totaling 150 million four of those notes totaling 100 million have fixed coupon interest rates of 515 and mature on october 15 2015 the other 50 million note has a fixed coupon interest rate of 470 and matures on october 1 2013 for each of the notes we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth london inter bank offering rate “libor” plus a spread the swaps have the same notional amounts and maturity dates as the notes and are accounted for as fair value hedges under sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” fas 133 except for the swap for the 50 million note maturing october 1 2013 the swap for that note has the same notional amount and fixed coupon interest rate as the note but expires october 2 2006 accordingly the swap does not qualify for fair value hedge accounting so changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in net income each period as a component of other expense net after issuance of these notes 760 million remains available to be issued under the shelf registration we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2005 depending on general corporate needs 

  

as of may 31 2004 we had a 5year 750 million revolving credit facility in place with a group of banks and we currently have no amounts outstanding under the facility the maturity date is november 20 2008 and the facility can be extended for one additional year on the anniversary date based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings would be the prevailing libor plus 022 the facility fee is 008 of the total commitment 

  

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fee and interest rate under our committed credit facility would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fee and interest rate would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities under this committed credit facility we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur and set a minimum capitalization ratio in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under this facility failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2004 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

  

liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was no amount outstanding at may 31 2004 or may 31 2003 we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

  

we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our previous discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

  

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 

  

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

  

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

  

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

  

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

  

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 

  

we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger reserve might be required in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 

  

inventory reserves 

  

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

  

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

  

a significant portion of our demand creation expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

  

some of the contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

  

some of the contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

  

some of the contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

  

property plant and equipment 

  

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

  

when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property plant and equipment may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded as other expense net we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

we adopted fas 142 effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 in accordance with fas 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter or when events indicate that an impairment exists as required by fas 142 in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units our estimates may change in future periods due to among other things technological change economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 

  

as discussed further above upon adoption of fas 142 in fiscal 2003 we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2661 million this charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change post the first quarter of fiscal 2003 any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense net 

  

intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in these cases we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value any impairment charges would be classified as other expense net 

  

hedge accounting for derivatives 

  

we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by fas 133 have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes significantly we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other expense net during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

  

taxes 

  

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made 

  

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

  

we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of foreign earnings declared as reinvested offshore and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our approach may also result in accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

  

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

  

other contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us including related legal costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations however if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense net during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales product sourcing and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts options and crosscurrency swaps to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party or intercompany transactions 

  

when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months although at may 31 2004 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries we use forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in european currencies japanese yen canadian dollars korean won mexican pesos and australian dollars 

  

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest 

  

market risk measurement 

  

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk var our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts crosscurrency swaps interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

  

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var 

  

computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies including those which are hedged by these instruments 

  

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

  

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 249 million and 210 million at may 31 2004 and may 31 2003 respectively the increase in var as of may 31 2004 occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2004 var computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2003 var computation such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 500 million and 433 million for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 respectively 

  

details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described below these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 

  

   

   

intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties 

  

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 

  

there were no significant changes in debt or crosscurrency swap market risks during fiscal 2004 crosscurrency swaps outstanding as of may 31 2003 matured in fiscal 2004 and no new crosscurrency swaps were executed during fiscal 2004 the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was 7118 million at may 31 2003 which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination the us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at may 31 2003 was 2345 million versus a carrying value of 1901 million at that date the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar denominated debt the euro swap payable and the us dollar swap receivable as of may 31 2003 were 5822 million 1935 million and 2116 million respectively versus carrying values of 5400 million 1860 million and 2000 million respectively at that date 

  

in fiscal 2002 we issued a 250 million longterm fixedrate corporate bond which matures in august 2006 in fiscal 2003 and 2004 we issued an additional 240 million in longterm fixedrate corporate bonds which mature on various dates beginning in july 2007 through october 2015 fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 47 to 566 for each of the bonds issued in fiscal 2002 2003 and fiscal 2004 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth libor plus a spread each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond except for one swap for a 50 million bond issued in fiscal 2004 maturing in october 2013 that swap expires in october 2006 as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 24 at may 31 2004 and 25 at may 31 2003 these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt except for the 50 million swap expiring in october 2006 which is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded to net income each period the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps accounted for as fair value hedges was a net 33 million gain at may 31 2004 and a 255 million gain at may 31 2003 the fair value of the 50 million interest rate swap expiring october 2006 was a 06 million loss at may 31 2004 

  

in fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3month libor plus a spread under the interest rate swap agreement the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 08 and receives variable interest payments based on 3month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion japanese yen this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income each period the recorded fair value of the swap was a 04 million gain at may 31 2004 and a 10 million loss at may 31 2003

products 

  

nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovative design for men women and children running basketball children’s crosstraining and women’s shoes are currently our topselling product categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future however we also market shoes designed for outdoor activities tennis golf soccer baseball football bicycling volleyball wrestling cheerleading aquatic activities hiking and other athletic and recreational uses 

  

we sell active sports apparel covering most of the above categories athletically inspired lifestyle apparel as well as athletic bags and accessory items nike apparel and accessories are designed to complement our athletic footwear products feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar design or for specific purposes we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos

sales and marketing 

  

the table below shows certain information regarding nike’s united states and international nonus revenues for the three years ending may 31 2003 

  

   

financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 17 of the consolidated financial statements on page 59 

  

we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment 

  

because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends 

  

and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk failure to timely and adequately respond could have a material adverse affect on our sales and profitability 

  

united states market 

  

during fiscal 2003 sales in the united states accounted for approximately 49 percent of total revenues compared to 53 percent in fiscal 2002 and 54 percent in fiscal 2001 we sell to approximately 18000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2003 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 27 percent of nike brand sales in the united states excluding sales from nike golf and bauer nike hockey and 24 percent of total sales in the united states 

  

we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the commitment that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal year 2003 91 percent of our us footwear shipments excluding cole haan bauer hurley and nike golf were made under the futures program compared to 92 percent in fiscal 2002 and 86 percent in fiscal 2001 in fiscal 2003 67 percent of our us apparel shipments were made under the futures program compared to 69 percent in fiscal 2002 and 67 percent in 2001 

  

we utilize 19 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 11 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf cycling water sports and outdoor activities in addition we operate the following retail outlets in the united states 

  

   

nike’s domestic distribution centers for footwear are located in wilsonville oregon memphis tennessee and greenland new hampshire apparel products are shipped from our memphis distribution center cole haan and bauer nike hockey products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire and hurley products are shipped from costa mesa california 

  

international markets 

  

we currently market our products in nearly 200 countries outside of the united states through independent distributors licensees subsidiaries and branch offices nonus sales accounted for 51 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2003 compared to 47 percent in fiscal 2002 and 46 percent in fiscal 2001 we operate 24 distribution centers in europe asia australia latin america africa and canada and also distribute through independent distributors and licensees we estimate that our products are sold through more than 30000 retail accounts outside the united states in many countries and regions including japan canada asia some latin american countries and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 14 percent of nonus sales 

  

we operate 175 retail outlets outside the united states which consist of niketowns factory stores employee stores and cole haan stores 

  

international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada chile croatia czech republic denmark finland france germany hong kong hungary indonesia india ireland israel italy japan korea malaysia mexico new zealand the netherlands norway peoples republic of china the philippines poland portugal singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and vietnam 

  

orders 

  

worldwide futures for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery between june and november 2003 were 49 billion compared to 46 billion for the same period last year based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although the orders may be cancelled 

  

product research and development 

  

we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that reduce or eliminate injury aid athletic performance and maximize comfort 

  

in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process 

  

manufacturing 

  

in fiscal 2003 approximately 1 percent of total nike brand apparel production for sale to the united states market was manufactured in the united states by independent contract manufacturers most of which are located in the southern states the remainder was manufactured by independent contractors located in 35 countries most of this apparel production occurred in bangladesh bulgaria china hong kong india indonesia malaysia mexico pakistan the philippines sri lanka taiwan thailand and turkey substantially all of our apparel production for sale to the international market was manufactured outside the us our largest single apparel supplier accounted for approximately 7 percent of total fiscal 2003 apparel production 

  

virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2003 contract suppliers in the following countries manufactured the following percentages of total nike brand footwear 

  

   

we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india mexico south africa and zimbabwe to manufacture footwear for sale primarily within those countries our largest single footwear supplier accounted for approximately 7 percent of total fiscal 2003 footwear production 

  

the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning 

  

components nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike is our sole supplier of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

  

our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties quotas restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability see “trade legislation” below we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our footwear operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could eliminate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that any adverse impact would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks 

  

all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties quotas or other restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future the enactment of any such duties quotas or restrictions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole 

  

since 1972 nissho iwai american corporation “niac” a subsidiary of nissho iwai corporation a large japanese trading company has performed significant importexport financing services for us currently niac provides such financing services with respect to at least 80 of the nike products sold outside of the united states europe and japan approximately 12 of nike products are sold outside of the united states europe and japan any failure of niac to provide these services or any failure of niac’s banks could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with niac expire on may 31 2005 

  

trade legislation 

  

our nonus operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the imposition of import quotas or antidumping duties in 1994 the european union “eu” commission imposed quotas on certain types of footwear manufactured in china these quotas replaced national quotas that had previously been in effect in several member states footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above 9 euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” is excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas have not to date had a material effect on our business in addition the eu commission has announced that footwear quotas will be eliminated globally beginning january 1 2005 

  

in 1995 the eu commission at the request of european footwear manufacturers initiated two antidumping investigations within the footwear industry covering footwear imported from the people’s republic of china indonesia and thailand as a result in 1997 the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on certain textile upper footwear imported from china and indonesia in 1998 the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on certain synthetic and leather upper footwear originating in china indonesia and thailand these antidumping duties were removed in 2003 and are no longer applicable for footwear imports into the eu these measures had no impact on us 

  

the eu commission in june 2000 issued an amendment to the explanatory notes to the eu’s customs nomenclature “cn” the amendment which is not legally binding interprets some of the technical criteria for the staf exclusion and the footwear types that can be classified as for use in sporting activity the amendment restricts somewhat the scope of the staf exclusion from the quotas and also the sports footwear exclusions from the two eu antidumping measures to date the large majority of our footwear models fall within the exclusions provided for under the cn our innovative footwear designs may stretch the traditional concepts of athletic or sports footwear reflected in the technical criteria we anticipate that the majority of these new designs will fall within the exclusions nike is an active participant in discussions to revise the technical criteria to reflect technologically advanced designs 

  

on may 1 2004 10 new countries will join the eu they will also join the eu single market and discussions are presently underway to increase the current eu quota system to account for the enlarged eu market nike and other manufacturers do not expect this expansion of the eu single market to present any significant challenges to the importation into the eu of sports footwear produced in china as the eu has announced that it will increase the quotas to take account of the enlarged consumer and market demand 

  

if the eu trade measures become substantially more restrictive we would consider shifting the production of our sports footwear to other countries in order to maintain competitive pricing and access to these markets we believe that we are prepared to deal effectively with any such change of circumstances and that any adverse impact would be of a temporary nature we continue to closely monitor international restrictions and maintain our multicountry sourcing strategy and contingency plans we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position regarding these trade measures 

  

we currently source footwear and apparel products from factories in vietnam in july 2000 the united states and vietnam signed a historic comprehensive bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides reciprocal nondiscriminatory normal trade relations “ntr” between the two countries in september 2001 that agreement was approved by congress and then ratified by the vietnamese national assembly once approved the united states granted an annual extension of ntr to vietnam under current us law the president must renew this grant annually with the opportunity for review by congress in may 2003 president bush renewed ntr for vietnam for an additional year and we anticipate congress will support this decision we currently believe that absent unforeseen circumstances the president will continue his annual extensions of ntr to vietnam and that congress will support the president’s decisions ongoing ntr trading status for vietnam will allow us to expand our production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamesesourced product to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates 

  

competition 

  

the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including reebok adidas and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations 

  

nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 

  

trademarks and patents 

  

we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in 

  

distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike ® and swoosh design ® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks that we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement 

  

nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air ® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of similar technology subsequent nike air patents will not expire for several years we also have a number of patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable 

  

employees 

  

we had approximately 23300 employees at may 31 2003 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent none of our employees are represented by a union with the exception of bauer nike hockey inc of bauer nike hockey’s north american employees approximately 74 percent or approximately 550 are covered by three union collective bargaining agreements with three separate bargaining units and all of bauer nike hockey’s approximately 210 nonimmigrant employees in italy are covered by three collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreements expire on various dates from 2003 through 2005 there has never been a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

another related shareholder derivative lawsuit lendman v knight et al cv011153as was filed in the us district court for the district of oregon on july 26 2001 the federal derivative complaint is not materially different from the original complaint in the state derivative action it alleges substantially similar causes of action and seeks substantially similar remedies the federal derivative action was served on the company and the individual defendants on december 13 2001 and was also stayed pending the outcome of in re nike inc securities litigation on december 13 2001 on may 30 2003 the court entered an order of administrative dismissal dismissing the case without prejudice

nike’s class b common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange and the pacific stock exchange and trades under the symbol nke at july 25 2003 there were 19198 holders of record of our class b common stock and 23 holders of record of our class a common stock these figures do not include beneficial owners who hold shares in nominee name the class a common stock is not publicly traded but each share is convertible upon request of the holder into one share of class b common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

  

we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies 

  

require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 

  

within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 

  

revenue recognition 

  

we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 

  

in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer in these cases we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 

  

in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically 

  

as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 

  

reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 

  

we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger reserve might be required in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 

  

inventory reserves 

  

we also make ongoing estimates relating to the net realizable value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 

  

contingent payments under endorsement contracts 

  

a significant portion of our demand creation advertising and promotion expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract 

  

certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal 

  

certain contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period 

  

certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record the amount of the guaranteed payment in excess of that earned through sales of product in selling and administrative expense uniformly over the remaining guarantee period 

  

property plant and equipment 

  

property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value 

  

when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of property plant and equipment may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded as other expense we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may change in future periods due to among other things technological changes economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges in the period in which such changes in estimates are made 

  

goodwill and other intangible assets 

  

we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 142 effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2003 in accordance with fas 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but instead measured for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an impairment exists as required by fas 142 in our impairment tests for goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets we compare the estimated fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets to the carrying value if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of fair value we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over our estimate of fair value our estimates of fair value utilized 

  

in goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible asset tests may be based upon a number of factors including our assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units our estimates may change in future periods due to among other things technological change economic conditions changes to our business operations or inability to meet business plans such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 

  

as discussed further below upon adoption of fas 142 we recorded an impairment charge related to goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets of 2661 million this charge is shown on our consolidated statement of income as the cumulative effect of accounting change in future periods any goodwill impairment charges would be classified as a separate line item on our consolidated statement of income as part of income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change other indefinitelived intangible asset impairment charges would be classified as other expense 

  

intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired in these cases we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair value any impairment charges would be classified as other expense 

  

hedge accounting for derivatives 

  

we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than net income until the underlying hedged transaction affects net income in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into net income some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes significantly we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other incomeexpense during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction 

  

taxes 

  

we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the year such determination is made 

  

in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be indefinitely reinvested offshore 

  

we take a conservative approach in determining the amount of foreign earnings to declare as reinvested offshore as required by us generally accepted accounting principles the presumption is that such earnings will be repatriated in the future we carefully review all factors that drive the ultimate disposition of such foreign earnings and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this conservative approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events the possibility exists that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated for instance the actual cash needs of our us entities may exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities may be less than our current expectations this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determined that amounts were no longer indefinitely reinvested offshore conversely our conservative approach may result in accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination 

  

on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

  

other contingencies 

  

in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will materially exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations however if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 

  

results of operations 

  

fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 

  

   

   

   

   

   

revenue growth in our international regions drove the 8 increase in consolidated revenues in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 changes in currency exchange rates primarily the euro were responsible for 4 of the consolidated revenue growth 

  

our largest international region europe middle east and africa emea reported 20 revenue growth in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 this growth reflected a 15 percentage point improvement due to changes in currency exchange rates growth in the emerging markets in central and eastern europe was the key driver of the balance of the increase as our distribution continued to expand in these markets and customer demand increased excluding the effect from changes in currency exchange rates each of our emea business units footwear apparel and equipment delivered revenue growth versus the prior year 

  

emea pretax income grew from 4224 million in fiscal 2002 to 5330 million in fiscal 2003 higher revenues and improved gross margins drove the increase more than offsetting incremental selling and administrative costs 

  

in asia pacific revenues increased 19 in fiscal 2003 five percentage points of this growth were due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the benefit from changes in currency exchange rates sales in each asia pacific business unit grew in fiscal 2003 as did sales in almost every country of the region particularly japan and korea driven primarily by heightened consumer demand for our products following the 2002 world cup and our related marketing campaign and china driven primarily by an expansion of retail distribution of our products 

  

pretax income for the asia pacific region increased from 2162 million in fiscal 2002 to 2950 million in fiscal 2003 this increase reflected higher revenues and improved gross margins that more than offset higher selling and administrative costs 

  

in the americas region fiscal 2003 revenues decreased 7 compared to fiscal 2002 reflecting higher sales in local currencies that were more than offset by a 15 percentage point decline due to changes in currency exchange rates this currency exchange impact was due to weaker currencies in the latin american markets partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar excluding the currency exchange rate impact the region experienced sales growth in the footwear and equipment business units slightly offset by a small percentage decrease in the apparel business unit on a geographic basis excluding currency exchange rate impacts the region experienced sales growth in brazil argentina and mexico reflecting stronger consumer demand the sales growth in argentina reflected a rebound since fiscal 2002 when that country underwent an economic crisis 

  

pretax income for the americas region grew from 921 million in fiscal 2002 to 963 million in fiscal 2003 pretax income improved despite lower reported revenues primarily due to an improved gross margin percentage 

  

in the us region revenues were down slightly in fiscal 2003 at 46584 million versus 46696 million in fiscal 2002 us footwear revenues were down 4 more than offsetting sales growth in us apparel and equipment us apparel sales increased 953 million dollars primarily driven by increased consumer demand for team licensed apparel lower revenues in the footwear business unit were largely the result of a significant change in our us footwear distribution 

  

during fiscal 2003 we began a realignment of our us footwear distribution to address the changing retail marketplace including our largest customer’s foot locker reduction in emphasis on premium footwear in its offerings the objectives of this realignment are to improve the presentation and profitability of the nike brand in the us as a result of changes in both foot locker’s orders and our product offerings to this account our fiscal 2003 sales to foot locker in the us were significantly below the level of fiscal 2002 at the same time we expanded the premium products available to other athletic specialty and independent retailers that focus on premium footwear offerings increasing sales to these accounts significantly 

  

based upon us futures orders scheduled for delivery through december 2003 we expect that us footwear revenues will remain below prior year levels at least through the first half of fiscal 2004 in the short 

  

term we do not expect to fully offset the revenue decline from foot locker in the us and the amounts of future sales to foot locker are uncertain however we believe the nike brand continues to enjoy strong consumer demand and that we will successfully realign our distribution to fulfill consumers’ demand for our products and generate profitable revenue growth 

  

our unit sales of footwear in the us increased slightly as compared to fiscal 2002 however this volume increase was more than offset by a decline in the average price per pair of footwear sold the reduction in average price per pair in fiscal 2003 versus fiscal 2002 reflected a higher percentage of sales of classic footwear and kids’ models which have a lower average price than our more complex adult performance models based upon futures orders average price per pair ordered by customers for delivery in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was slightly below the prior year but the average price per pair increased for second quarter orders 

  

us region pretax income increased from 9560 million in fiscal 2002 to 9575 million in fiscal 2003 pretax income improved despite lower revenues and higher selling and administrative expense due to improved gross margins 

  

other revenues include revenues from bauer nike hockey inc cole haan holdings inc hurley international llc and nike golf in fiscal 2003 we began managing the nike golf operations in our largest golf markets separately from our regional businesses as a result beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 revenues and pretax income for these businesses have been excluded from the regional results and reported in the other category this nike golf information for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 has been reclassified in this form 10k to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation 

  

other revenues grew 12 in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 the addition of revenues from our hurley business purchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 drove the increase in other revenues 

  

other pretax income declined from 568 million in fiscal 2002 to 189 million in fiscal 2003 reduced profitability at nike golf drove this decline reflecting significantly weaker demand in the us golf market versus fiscal 2002 and startup issues we experienced at a thirdparty distribution facility we expect that demand in the us for golf products throughout the industry and for our business may remain weak in the near term due to the current slowdown of the us economy 

  

the breakdown of revenues follows 

  

   

this discussion includes disclosure of “pretax income” for our operating segments we have reported pretax income for each of our operating segments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 131 “disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information” as discussed in note 17 — operating segments and related information in the attached notes to consolidated financial statements  certain corporate costs are not included in pretax income of our operating segments 

  

worldwide futures and advance orders for our footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june 2003 to november 2003 were 50 higher than such orders reported in the comparable period of fiscal 2002 five points of this reported increase were due to changes in currency exchange rates versus the same period last year on our june 26 2003 press release we reported that worldwide futures and advance orders for this period were up 44 as compared to last year and that futures and advance orders in the us were down 10 as compared to last year our futures program permits changes to orders for a short period of time following the order deadline such changes to us orders most notably additional orders of footwear from foot locker increased the growth in worldwide futures for the june to november period by 06 percentage points to 50 and reduced the decrease in us orders from 10 to 9 these orders were for footwear consistent with our distribution realignment strategy discussed above the reported futures orders growth is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth during this period this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between futures orders and actual revenues moreover a significant portion of our revenues is not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment 

  

us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan nike golf hurley and retail sales across all brands 

  

in fiscal 2003 our consolidated gross margin percentage improved 17 points as compared to fiscal 2002 from 393 to 410 significant factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage were as follows 

  

   

   

lower pricing of nike golf products as a result of market conditions discussed above partially offset these positive margin drivers changes in currency exchange rates did not have a material impact on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as the benefit of stronger hedge rates in some currencies was offset by weaker hedge rates in other currencies a significant portion of product purchases for fiscal 2004 are already hedged and we expect that changes in yearoveryear hedge rates will have a net positive effect on our gross margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as the benefits of stronger euro hedge rates more than offset weaker hedge rates in other currencies 

  

selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from 285 in fiscal 2002 to 293 in fiscal 2003 both demand creation and operating overhead expense increased as a percentage of revenues demand creation expense grew from 10279 million in fiscal 2002 to 11686 million in fiscal 2003 higher costs incurred in the emea region drove the growth in demand creation expense reflecting 1 a stronger euro currency exchange rate compared to the us dollar which resulted in higher us dollar expenses for costs that are eurodenominated 2 our new endorsement agreement with the manchester united soccer team that became effective in august 2002 and 3 costs of our world cup marketing campaign incurred in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 higher demand creation expenses were also incurred in the asia pacific and americas regions due to the world cup marketing campaign we also increased demand creation spending in the us in order to drive continued consumer demand for footwear while we realign our distribution to retail customers 

  

operating overhead increased from 17925 million in fiscal 2002 to 19690 million in fiscal 2003 major drivers of this increase were the stronger euro exchange rate incremental costs related to our ongoing development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain primarily reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in note 17 — operating segments and related information  investments in headcount for our nike golf business the addition of hurley overhead costs beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and overhead costs of additional retail stores in emea and asia pacific 

  

as part of our worldwide supply chain initiative we implemented new systems in the emea region in fiscal 2003 prior to the emea region implementation we implemented new systems and processes for certain global functions and for our us and canadian businesses over the next few years we will continue to enhance and refine the systems and processes in the us emea and canada as well as implement our new supply chain platform in the remaining countries in which we operate over this time period operating overhead expense will continue to include costs of the supply chain initiative as well as costs for supporting our existing system infrastructure for those businesses where we have not yet implemented the new systems this initiative is intended to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions margins by lowering closeouts and distribution costs and cash flow by reducing inventories in the us where the new systems have been in place for over a year we have begun to see improvements in several key performance measures the ultimate level of benefit if any to revenues margins and cash flows will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented in the remaining countries in which we operate and globally integrated over the next few years 

  

interest expense decreased from 476 million in fiscal 2002 to 429 million in fiscal 2003 a decline of 10 the decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels as we have used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt 

  

other incomeexpense was net expense of 799 million compared to net expense of 30 million in fiscal 2002 significant amounts included in other incomeexpense were interest income profit sharing expense goodwill amortization fiscal 2002 only and certain foreign currency gains and losses 

  

an increase in net foreign currency losses was the largest contributor to the increase in other expense versus last year these foreign currency losses were primarily due to hedge losses on intercompany charges to a european subsidiary whose functional currency is the euro these losses are reflected in the corporate line in our segment presentation of pretax income in note 17 — operating segments and related information  the hedge losses reflected that the euro has strengthened considerably since we entered into these hedge contracts in fiscal 2003 net foreign currency losses in other incomeexpense were more than offset by favorable translation of foreign currency denominated profits our estimate of the net impact of these losses and the favorable translation is a 13 million addition to consolidated income before income taxes consistent with our existing policies we have continued to hedge anticipated intercompany charges for fiscal 2004 since the euro has continued to strengthen since these hedge contracts were executed we expect to continue to incur some hedge losses in fiscal 2004 however we expect the net impact of the hedge losses and the offsetting positive translation impact will result in a net benefit to fiscal 2004 consolidated net income versus the prior year 

  

our fiscal 2003 effective tax rate was 341 relatively consistent with the fiscal 2002 effective rate of 343 

  

included in fiscal 2003 net income was a 2661 million charge for the cumulative effect of implementing fas 142 this charge related to the impairment of goodwill and trademarks associated with bauer nike hockey and the goodwill of cole haan reflecting that the fair values we estimated for these assets were less than the carrying values in addition the adoption of this accounting standard resulted in a reduction to goodwill and intangible asset amortization of 131 million as compared to fiscal 2002 see the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 4 — identifiable intangible assets and goodwill for further information 

  

fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

as discussed above our fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 nike golf information has been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2003 presentation this presentation reflects significant nike golf operations as a separate business in the other category rather than within each of our geographical regions the following discussion of fiscal 2002 results versus fiscal 2001 by region reflects this reclassification of nike golf operations this reclassification did not result in any change to our previously reported consolidated results nor did it result in a significant change to the previously reported revenue and profitability trends in each of our regional businesses in fiscal 2002 this reclassification did result in significantly higher revenues and profits reported in the other category 

  

in the us region revenues were flat in fiscal 2002 versus fiscal 2001 reflecting increased sales of apparel and equipment offset by decreased sales of footwear the increased sales in apparel reflected higher demand for inline products particularly for nike brand and brand jordan basketball apparel more than offsetting the effect of the expiration of our apparel license agreement with the national football league in fiscal 2001 while inline sales of footwear increased in fiscal 2002 particularly in the midrange price segment closeout sales decreased significantly the reduction in closeout sales reflected both our efforts to limit the availability of closeout products in the marketplace in order to build overall profitability and relatively high levels of closeout sales in the last half of fiscal 2001 due to supply chain system disruptions as in the apparel business sales of nike brand and brand jordan basketball footwear products were the primary drivers of increased wholesale sales of inline footwear during the year 

  

despite revenues and selling and administrative expense being essentially consistent with fiscal 2001 us pretax income increased from 9050 million to 9560 million driven primarily by an improved gross margin percentage 

  

in fiscal 2002 revenues from our international regions grew 6 versus the prior year changes in currency exchange rates decreased the international region growth rate 6 percentage points and decreased our consolidated growth rate 3 percentage points fiscal 2002 reported revenues in emea increased by 6 over fiscal 2001 including a 4 percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates excluding the negative effect of currency exchange rates emea revenues grew in each of our business units footwear apparel and equipment and in almost every country in the region reflecting increasing demand for nike brand products throughout emea 

  

emea pretax income grew 16 from 3634 million to 4224 million growth in revenues and a higher gross margin percentage drove the increase in pretax income 

  

in our asia pacific region reported revenues grew 7 including a 10 percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates asia pacific revenues grew in each business unit and in almost every country in the region with the largest growth coming from japan korea and china 

  

pretax income for the asia pacific region increased from 1844 million to 2162 million the increase in revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues drove the growth in pretax income which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin percentage 

  

the americas region reported revenues grew 5 including a 7 percentage point decrease due to changes in currency exchange rates despite a dropoff in sales in argentina during the second half of fiscal 2002 as a result of the country’s economic crisis revenues in the americas region grew in each of our business units led by growth in canada mexico and brazil 

  

pretax income for the americas region increased from 816 million to 921 million the increase in revenues and lower selling and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues drove the growth in pretax income which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin percentage 

  

in fiscal 2002 other revenues including revenues from bauer nike hockey cole haan hurley and nike golf increased 20 to 8166 million driven by growth in nike golf the hurley acquisition did not have a significant impact on fiscal 2002 revenues since the acquisition did not occur until the last quarter of fiscal 2002 

  

other pretax income declined from 742 million to 568 million driven by a decline in profitability at cole haan despite slight revenue growth at cole haan during the year pretax income declined due to relatively high discounting and inventory obsolescence as a result of depressed consumer demand in the wake of the september 11 2001 terrorist attacks 

  

our gross margin percentage improved from 390 in fiscal 2001 to 393 in fiscal 2002 factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage in fiscal 2002 were as follows 

  

   

   

   

selling and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues from 283 in fiscal 2001 to 285 in fiscal 2002 operating overhead increased 6 in fiscal 2002 significant drivers of the increased operating overhead included increased investment in our supply chain initiative additional headcount to support our golf and european businesses due to business growth additional expense for compensation programs tied to our profitability and stock performance and costs for additional retail stores primarily in our emea and asia pacific regions 

  

demand creation expense was 10279 million in fiscal 2002 versus 9982 million in fiscal 2001 which was consistent between years as a percentage of revenues our fiscal 2002 demand creation expense reflected incremental spending for our world cup 2002 marketing campaign which began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 

  

interest expense decreased 19 from 587 million in fiscal 2001 to 476 million in fiscal 2002 the decrease reflected both lower interest rates and lower average debt levels as we used cash flow from operations to reduce total debt 

  

other incomeexpense was a net expense of 30 million in fiscal 2002 versus a net expense of 341 million in fiscal 2001 significant amounts included in other incomeexpense included interest income profit sharing expense goodwill amortization certain foreign currency gains and losses and asset disposal gainslosses net other expense decreased between years as the fiscal 2001 amount included charges for contractual settlements that did not recur in fiscal 2002 in addition fiscal 2002 other incomeexpense included credits related to the favorable resolution of some outstanding claims 

  

our fiscal 2002 effective tax rate was 343 as compared to 360 in fiscal 2001 as required by us generally accepted accounting principles we do not accrue a us tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 is primarily the result of a larger amount of foreign earnings permanently invested offshore in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2001 

  

recently issued accounting standards 

  

in june 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 143 “accounting for asset retirement obligations” fas 143 this statement requires that a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized at fair value in the period the obligation is incurred and the associated retirement costs be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tangible longlived asset all provisions of this statement will be effective for the company on june 1 2003 we do not expect that the adoption of fas 143 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in june 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” fas 146 this statement supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 943 “liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring” fas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred under eitf 943 a liability was recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan fas 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value the provisions of fas 146 are effective for any exit and disposal activities initiated after 

  

december 31 2002 we have not entered into any significant exit or disposal activities since the effective date of this rule as such fas 146 has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations and no significant impact is expected in the foreseeable future 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” fin 45 fin 45 requires that upon issuance of a guarantee a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee fin 45 also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued the recognition provisions of fin 45 are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements of fin 45 were effective beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2003 

  

in connection with various contracts and agreements we provide routine indemnifications relating to the enforceability of intellectual property rights coverage for legal issues that arise and other items that fall under the scope of fin 45 currently we have several such agreements in place however based on our historical experience and estimated probability of future loss we have determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material hence the adoption of fin 45 has not had an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations and no significant impact is expected in the foreseeable future 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation— transition and disclosure—an amendment of fasb statement no 123” fas 148 this statement amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stock based compensation” fas 123 to provide alternative methods of voluntarily transitioning to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation fas 148 also amends the disclosure requirements of fas 123 to require disclosure of the method used to account for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method on reported results in both annual and interim financial statements the disclosure provisions are effective for us beginning with this fiscal 2003 annual report on form 10k the annual impact of a change to the fair value model prescribed by fas 123 has been disclosed in our previous 10k filings and the applicable disclosures in this report are in note 1 and note 10 of the notes to consolidated financial statements  at this time we plan to continue to account for stockbased compensation using the intrinsic method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 25 “accounting for stock issued to employees” rather than change to the fas 123 fair value method 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities” fin 46 this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” addresses consolidation of variable interest entities fin 46 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved the provisions of fin 46 are effective immediately for those variable interest entities created after january 31 2003 the provisions are effective for the first period beginning after june 15 2003 for those variable interests held prior to february 1 2003 we do not currently have any variable interest entities as defined in fin 46 accordingly we do not expect the provisions of fin 46 to affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

fiscal 2003 cash flow activity 

  

cash provided by operations was 9174 million in fiscal 2003 compared to 10815 million in fiscal 2002 our primary source of operating cash flow was income before the cumulative effect of an accounting change of 7401 million operating cash flow decreased compared to the prior year due to increased investment in certain working capital components during fiscal 2003 including inventories while a decline in inventory levels provided a source of cash during fiscal 2002 an increase in inventory levels during fiscal 2003 resulted in a use of cash primarily due to our decision to purchase product for the us “backtoschool” selling season earlier than we did last year in order to improve the timeliness of shipments to customers 

  

cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2003 was 2156 million compared to 3028 million invested during fiscal 2002 the most significant investing activities in both periods were expenditures for 

  

computer equipment and software related to our supply chain initiative and continued investment in nikeowned retail stores spending for both of these activities declined in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 additionally fiscal 2002 spending included our acquisition of all of the assets and substantially all of the liabilities of hurley international llc an action sports and youth lifestyle brand company costs incurred for distribution center projects increased in fiscal 2003 the largest project being construction of a new storage building in japan with scheduled opening in the second half of fiscal 2004 during fiscal 2004 we will continue to make investments in systems improvements most notably the supply chain initiative retail expansion and our worldwide distribution center facilities additionally during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 we entered into an agreement to purchase converse inc discussed further below 

  

cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2003 was 6052 million up from 4782 million in the prior year this amount included uses of cash for dividends to shareholders a net reduction in debt and share repurchases these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 

  

the share repurchases were part of a 10 billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal 2001 after completion of a fouryear 10 billion program in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2003 we repurchased 40 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 1910 million to date under the current program we have purchased a total of 123 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 5857 million we expect to continue to fund the current program from operating cash flow the timing and the ultimate amount of shares purchased under the program will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

  

longterm financial obligations and other commercial commitments 

  

our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2003 and significant endorsement contracts entered into through the date of this report are as follows 

  

   

the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products actual payments under some contracts will likely be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements in future periods actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athlete performance declines in future periods 

  

in addition to the cash payments disclosed above we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers 

  

an outsourcing contractor provides us with information technology operations management services through 2006 the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may 31 2003 we would be required to provide the contractor with four months’ notice and pay a termination fee of 327 million our monthly payments to the contractor currently are approximately 6 million 

  

we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2003 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 6 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  for further description and interest rates related to the shortterm debt obligations listed below 

  

   

as of may 31 2003 letters of credit of 7044 million were outstanding primarily for the purchase of inventory all letters of credit generally expire within one year 

  

on july 9 2003 we entered into an agreement to purchase all of the equity shares of converse inc a widely recognized footwear company based in massachusetts for 305 million cash prior to closing this transaction is subject to regulatory review including us government review under the hartscottrodino premerger notification act if the acquisition is completed we do not expect it will have a significant effect on our liquidity results of operations or financial position in the short term while we do expect a positive impact on our longterm profitability from this acquisition we cannot reasonably estimate this impact at this time 

  

capital resources 

  

in october 2001 we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec under which 10 billion in debt securities may be issued in may 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 5000 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements during fiscal 2003 we issued a total of 90 million in notes under the mediumterm note program the notes have coupon rates that range from 480 to 566 the maturities range from july 9 2007 to august 7 2012 for each of the notes we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth london inter bank offering rate libor plus a spread each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as its respective note after issuance of these notes 4100 million remains available to be issued under our medium note program and another 5000 million remains available to be issued under our shelf registration statement we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2004 depending on working capital general corporate needs 

  

as of may 31 2003 we had a total of 10 billion available under two committed credit facilities in place with a group of banks and we currently have no amounts outstanding under either facility the first facility is a 5000 million 364day facility that will mature on november 14 2003 and can be extended 364 days on each maturity date the second facility is a 5000 million multiyear facility that matures on november 17 2005 and once a year it can be extended for one additional year both of these facilities have been in place since fiscal 2001 during fiscal 2003 upon renewal in november 2002 the 364day facility was reduced from 6000 million to 5000 million based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the 364day facility would be the prevailing libor plus 024 and the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the multiyear facility would be the prevailing libor plus 022 the facility fees for the 364day facility and the multiyear facility are 006 and 008 respectively of the total commitment 

  

if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fees and interest rates under our committed credit facilities would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating were to improve the facility fees and interest 

  

rates would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities however under these committed credit facilities we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur and set a minimum ratio of net worth to indebtedness in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2003 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the foreseeable future 

  

liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was no amount outstanding at may 31 2003 and 3383 million outstanding at may 31 2002 we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively 

  

we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs in the foreseeable future 

  

dividends per share of common stock for fiscal 2003 were 054 compared to 048 in fiscal 2002 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 we review our dividend policy from time to time however based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend in the foreseeable future 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes 

  

we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales production and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party or intercompany transactions 

  

when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months although at may 31 2003 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 18 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our european and japanese subsidiaries we use forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration hedged transactions are principally denominated in european currencies japanese yen canadian dollars korean won mexican pesos and australian dollars 

  

our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest 

  

market risk measurement 

  

we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk var our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts crosscurrency swaps interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 

  

we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variancecovariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the var calculation including those which are hedged by these instruments 

  

the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors 

  

the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 210 million and 137 million at may 31 2003 and may 31 2002 respectively the increase in var as of may 31 2003 occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2003 var computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2002 var computation such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 433 million and 429 million for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 respectively 

  

details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described below these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates we have excluded the crosscurrency swaps from the foreign exchange risk category because these instruments eliminate all foreign currency exposure in the cash flows of a euro denominated intercompany loan we have included these crosscurrency swaps in the interest rate risk category but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category because the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation for the crosscurrency swaps the table presents both the euro swap payable and us dollar swap receivable and the respective pay and receive interest rates all information is presented in millions of us dollars except interest rates 

  

intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties 

  

the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries 

  

there were no significant changes in debt or crosscurrency swap market risks during fiscal 2003 the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was 6494 million at may 31 2002 which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination the us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at may 31 2002 was 2074 million versus a carrying value of 1814 million at that date the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar denominated debt the euro swap payable and the us dollar swap receivable as of may 31 2002 were 5165 million 1962 million and 2679 million respectively versus carrying values of 4998 million 1888 million and 2500 million respectively at that date 

  

in fiscal 2002 we issued a 250 million longterm fixedrate corporate bond which matures in august 2006 in fiscal 2003 we issued an additional 90 million in longterm fixedrate corporate bonds which mature on various dates beginning in july 2007 through august 2012 fixed interest rates on these bonds range from 48 to 566 for each of these bonds issued in fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003 we have entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the bonds and pay variable interest payments based on the threemonth or sixmonth libor plus a spread each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as the corresponding bond as a result of the interest rate swap agreements the average effective interest rate payable on these bonds was 25 at may 31 2003 and 33 at may 31 2002 these interest rate swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges so changes in the recorded fair values of the swaps are offset by changes in the recorded fair value of the related debt the recorded fair value of the interest rate swaps was a 255 million gain at may 31 2003 and a 18 million loss at may 31 2002 

  

in fiscal 2003 we also entered into an interest rate swap agreement related to a japanese yen denominated intercompany loan with one of our japanese subsidiaries the japanese subsidiary pays variable interest on the intercompany loan based on 3month libor plus a spread under the interest rate swap agreement the subsidiary pays fixed interest payments at 08 and receives variable interest payments based on 3month libor plus a spread based on a notional amount of 8 billion japanese yen this interest rate swap is not accounted for as a hedge accordingly changes in the fair value of the swap are recorded to net income as of may 31 2003 the recorded fair value of the swap was a 10 million loss

 item 1 business tableend general   nike inc was incorporated in 1968 under the laws of the state of oregon as used in this report the terms “we” “us” “nike” and the “company” refer to nike inc and its predecessors subsidiaries and affiliates unless the context indicates otherwise   our principal business activity involves the design development and worldwide marketing of high quality footwear apparel equipment and accessory products nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world we sell our products to approximately 18000 retail accounts in the united states and through a mix of independent distributors licensees and subsidiaries in approximately 140 countries around the world virtually all of our products are manufactured by independent contractors virtually all footwear products are produced outside the united states while apparel products are produced both in the united states and abroad products   nike’s athletic footwear products are designed primarily for specific athletic use although a large percentage of the products are worn for casual or leisure purposes we place considerable emphasis on high quality construction and innovative design running basketball children’s crosstraining and women’s shoes are currently our topselling product categories and we expect them to continue to lead in product sales in the near future however we also market shoes designed for outdoor activities tennis golf soccer baseball football bicycling volleyball wrestling cheerleading aquatic activities hiking and other athletic and recreational uses   we sell active sports apparel covering most of the above categories athletically inspired lifestyle apparel as well as athletic bags and accessory items nike apparel and accessories are designed to complement our athletic footwear products feature the same trademarks and are sold through the same marketing and distribution channels we often market footwear apparel and accessories in “collections” of similar design or for specific purposes we also market apparel with licensed college and professional team and league logos   we sell a line of performance equipment under the nike brand name including sport balls timepieces eyewear skates bats gloves and other equipment designed for sports activities we also have agreements for licensees to produce and sell nike brand swimwear women’s sports bras cycling apparel children’s clothing posters school supplies timepieces and electronic media devices we also sell small amounts of various plastic products to other manufacturers through our whollyowned subsidiary nike ihm inc   we sell a line of dress and casual footwear and accessories for men women and children under the brand name cole haan® through our whollyowned subsidiary cole haan holdings inc headquartered in yarmouth maine   our whollyowned subsidiary bauer nike hockey inc headquartered in greenland new hampshire manufactures and distributes ice skates skate blades inline roller skates protective gear hockey sticks and hockey jerseys and accessories under the bauer® and nike® brand names bauer also offers a full selection of products for street roller and field hockey   in april 2002 we acquired hurley international llc headquartered in costa mesa california which designs and distributes a line of action sports apparel for surfing skateboarding and snowboarding and youth lifestyle apparel under the hurley brand name 2 sales and marketing   the table below shows certain information regarding nike’s united states and international nonus revenues for the last three fiscal years    financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note 16 of the consolidated financial statements on page 51   we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the year however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of footwear apparel and equipment   because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk failure to timely and adequately respond could have a material adverse affect on our sales and profitability 3 united states market   during fiscal 2002 sales in the united states accounted for approximately 53 percent of total revenues compared to 54 percent in fiscal 2001 and 56 percent in fiscal 2000 we sell to approximately 18000 retail accounts in the united states the nike brand domestic retail account base includes a mix of footwear stores sporting goods stores athletic specialty stores department stores skate tennis and golf shops and other retail accounts during fiscal year 2002 our three largest customers accounted for approximately 28 percent of nike brand sales in the united states and 26 percent of total sales in the united states   we make substantial use of our “futures” ordering program which allows retailers to order five to six months in advance of delivery with the guarantee that 90 percent of their orders will be delivered within a set time period at a fixed price in fiscal year 2002 92 percent of our us footwear shipments excluding cole haan bauer and hurley were made under the futures program compared to 86 percent in fiscal 2001 and 90 percent in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2002 77 percent of our us apparel shipments were made under the futures program compared to 78 percent in fiscal 2001 and 82 percent in 2000   we utilize 18 nike sales offices to solicit sales in the united states we also utilize 15 independent sales representatives to sell specialty products for golf cycling water sports and outdoor activities in addition we operate the following retail outlets in the united states    nike’s domestic distribution centers for footwear are located in beaverton oregon wilsonville oregon memphis tennessee and greenland new hampshire apparel products are shipped from our memphis distribution center cole haan footwear and bauer nike hockey products are distributed primarily from greenland new hampshire and hurley products are shipped from costa mesa california international markets   we currently market our products in approximately 140 countries outside of the united states through independent distributors licensees subsidiaries and branch offices nonus sales accounted for 47 percent of total revenues in fiscal 2002 compared to 46 percent in fiscal 2001 and 44 percent in fiscal 2000 we operate 19 distribution centers in europe asia australia latin america and canada and also distribute through independent distributors and licensees we estimate that our products are sold through more than 30000 retail accounts outside the united states in many countries and regions including japan canada asia latin america and europe we have a futures ordering program for retailers similar to the united states futures program described above nike’s three largest customers outside of the us accounted for approximately 9 percent of nonus sales   we operate 162 retail outlets outside the united states which are comprised of niketowns factory stores employee stores and cole haan stores   international branch offices and subsidiaries of nike are located in argentina australia austria belgium brazil canada chile croatia czech republic denmark finland france germany hong kong hungary indonesia india ireland israel italy japan korea malaysia mexico new zealand the netherlands norway peoples republic of china the philippines poland portugal singapore slovakia slovenia south africa spain sweden switzerland taiwan thailand turkey the united kingdom and vietnam 4 significant customers   foot locker inc which operates a chain of retail stores specializing in athletic footwear and apparel accounted for approximately 11 percent of global net sales of nike brand products during fiscal 2002 no other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our net sales during fiscal 2002 orders   as of may 31 2002 our worldwide futures orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel totaled 46 billion compared to 44 billion as of may 31 2001 these orders are scheduled for delivery from june through november of 2002 based upon historical data we expect that approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period although the orders may be cancelable product research and development   we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to produce products that reduce or eliminate injury aid athletic performance and maximize comfort   in addition to nike’s own staff of specialists in the areas of biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for product improvement employee athletes weartest and evaluate products during the design and development process manufacturing   in fiscal 2002 approximately 5 percent of total nike brand apparel production for sale to the united states market was manufactured in the united states by independent contract manufacturers most of which are located in the southern states the remainder was manufactured by independent contractors located in 28 countries most of this apparel production occurred in bangladesh bulgaria china hong kong india indonesia malaysia mexico pakistan the philippines sri lanka taiwan thailand and turkey substantially all of our apparel production for sale to the international market was manufactured outside the us our largest single apparel supplier accounted for approximately 8 percent of total fiscal 2002 apparel production   virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in fiscal 2002 contract suppliers in the following countries manufactured the following percentages of total nike brand footwear  we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina brazil india mexico south africa and zimbabwe to manufacture footwear for sale within those countries our largest single footwear supplier accounted for approximately 6 percent of total fiscal 2002 footwear production   the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike is our sole supplier of the airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in our 5 apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements 

  our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties quotas restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the world political instability see “trade legislation” below we have not to date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for the products obtained from our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our footwear operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse financial impact however we believe that we could eliminate any such disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that any adverse impact would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our principal competitors are subject to similar risks   all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states and other countries are subject to customs duties collected by customs authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs duties quotas or other restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our products in the future the enactment of any such duties quotas or restrictions could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole   since 1972 nissho iwai american corporation “niac” a subsidiary of nissho iwai corporation a large japanese trading company has performed significant importexport financing services for us currently niac provides such financing services with respect to at least 80 percent of the nike products sold outside of the united states europe and japan any failure of niac to provide these services could disrupt our ability to acquire products from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the united states europe and japan such a disruption could result in cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability however we believe that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our current agreements with niac expire on may 31 2003 trade legislation   our nonus operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business abroad such as the imposition of import quotas or antidumping duties in 1994 the european union “eu” commission imposed quotas on certain types of footwear manufactured in china these quotas replaced national quotas that had previously been in effect in several member states footwear designed for use in sporting activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance and freight price above 9 euros “special technology athletic footwear” or “staf” is excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the amount of quota made available to us the quotas have not to date had a material effect on our business   in 1995 the eu commission at the request of european footwear manufacturers initiated two antidumping investigations covering footwear imported from the people’s republic of china indonesia and thailand as a result in 1997 the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on certain textile upper footwear imported from china and indonesia in 1998 the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on certain synthetic and leather upper footwear originating in china indonesia and thailand in the case of textile upper footwear the antidumping duties do not cover sports footwear in the case of synthetic and leather upper footwear the antidumping duties do not cover footwear meeting the staf technical criteria nor footwear with a cif price above 57 euros as the antidumping duties for synthetic and leather uppers only affect some low cost footwear these measures have no impact for us while the exclusions are subject to some interpretation by customs authorities we believe that most of our footwear sourced in the target countries for sale in the eu fits within the exclusions we have also shifted the production of these types 6 of footwear to other countries accordingly the antidumping duties have not had a material effect on our business the eu commission has announced the impending expiration of these antidumping cases subject to possible review requests by the european footwear manufacturers such reviews may result in the renewal of the antidumping regulations 

  the eu commission in june 2000 issued an amendment to the explanatory notes to the eu’s customs nomenclature “cn” the amendment which is not legally binding interprets some of the technical criteria for the staf exclusion and the footwear types that can be classified as for use in sporting activity the amendment restricts somewhat the scope of the staf exclusion from the quotas and also the sports footwear exclusions from the two eu antidumping measures to date the large majority of our footwear models fall within the exclusions provided for under the cn our innovative footwear designs may stretch the traditional concepts of athletic or sports footwear reflected in the technical criteria we anticipate that the majority of these new designs will fall within the exclusions nike is an active participant in discussions to revise the technical criteria to reflect technologically advanced designs   if the eu trade measures become substantially more restrictive we would consider shifting the production of such footwear to other countries in order to maintain competitive pricing we believe that we are prepared to deal effectively with any such change of circumstances and that any adverse impact would be of a temporary nature we continue to closely monitor international restrictions and maintain our multicountry sourcing strategy and contingency plans we believe that our major competitors stand in much the same position regarding these trade measures   we currently source footwear and apparel products from factories in vietnam in july 2000 the united states and vietnam signed an historic comprehensive bilateral trade agreement which among other things provides reciprocal nondiscriminatory normal trade relations “ntr” between the two countries in september 2001 that agreement was approved by congress and then ratified by the vietnamese national assembly once approved the united states granted an annual extension of ntr to vietnam under current us law the president must renew this grant annually with the opportunity for review by the congress in june 2002 president bush renewed ntr for vietnam for an additional year and in july 2002 the congress supported the president’s decision we currently believe that absent unforeseen circumstances the president will continue his annual extensions of ntr to vietnam and that congress will support the president’s decisions ongoing ntr trading status for vietnam will allow us to expand our production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamesesourced product to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates competition   the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment including reebok adidas and others the intense competition and the rapid changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant risk factors in our operations   nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product development price product identity through marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that we are competitive in all of these areas 7 trademarks and patents   we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our nike® and swoosh design® trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many other trademarks which we utilize in marketing our products we continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement   nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using patented “air” technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in polyurethane some of the early nike air® patents have expired which may enable competitors to use certain types of like technology subsequent nike air patents will not expire for several years we also have a number of patents covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes we believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable employees   we had approximately 22700 employees at may 31 2002 management considers its relationship with employees to be excellent with the exception of bauer nike hockey inc our employees are not represented by a union of bauer nike hockey’s north american employees approximately 65 percent or fewer than 450 are covered by three union collective bargaining agreements with three separate bargaining units and all of bauer nike hockey’s approximately 150 nonimmigrant employees in italy are covered by three collective bargaining agreements the collective bargaining agreements expire on various dates from 2002 through 2003 there has never been a material interruption of operations due to

  another related shareholder derivative lawsuit lendman v knight et al cv011153as was filed in the us district court for the district of oregon on july 26 2001 the federal derivative suit is not materially different from the state derivative action it alleges substantially similar causes of action and seeks substantially similar remedies the federal derivative action was served on the company and the individual defendants on december 13 2001 and was also stayed pending the outcome of in re nike inc securities litigation on december 13 2001   in accordance with the company’s articles of incorporation and bylaws and in accordance with indemnity agreements between the company and the directors and officers named in the above legal actions the company has agreed to indemnify these individuals and assume their defense in the actions   the company and certain of its officers were named as defendants in an lawsuit kasky v nike inc et al no 994446 filed in 1998 in san francisco county superior court plaintiff brought the action under the california business and professions code alleging that statements made by the company in response to criticism about labor practices in factories making its products were false or misleading plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and restitution of profits earned from the alleged violations of the california code the claims were dismissed by the superior court with the court concluding that the alleged statements if made were protected speech as part of a public debate under the first amendment to the united states constitution plaintiff appealed the superior court ruling to the california court of appeals which court affirmed the ruling of the lower court plaintiff sought review in the california supreme court which on may 2 2002 overturned the lower court rulings by a four to three vote the california supreme court made no ruling on the merits of plaintiff’s contention that the company had made false or misleading statements but concluded that the alleged statements were commercial speech and not entitled to the full protection of the first amendment of the united states constitution the company filed a petition for rehearing before the california supreme court which was denied on july 31 2002 the case has been remanded to the lower california state courts for further proceedings we have announced our intention to seek review by the united states supreme court and have engaged additional counsel for that specific purpose since the litigation is in a preliminary stage we do not currently anticipate that the action will have a material financial impact we believe that the claims are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend against them

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies   our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 13 generally accepted in the united states the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

  we believe that the estimates assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances including the policies for revenue recognition the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable inventory reserves and contingent payments under endorsement contracts these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date however since our business cycle is relatively short actual results related to these estimates are generally known within the sixmonth period following the financial statement date thus these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters   within the context of these critical accounting policies we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in materially different amounts being reported revenue recognition   we record wholesale revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer based on the terms of sale title passes generally upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale   in some instances we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer in these cases we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks   in certain countries outside of the us precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available in these cases we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based upon historical delivery times by geographic location on the basis of our tests of actual transactions we have no indication that these estimates have been materially inaccurate historically   as part of our revenue recognition policy we record estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues at the time revenues are recorded we base our estimates on historical rates of product returns and claims and specific identification of outstanding claims and outstanding returns not yet received from customers in the past actual returns and claims have not exceeded our reserves however actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates if actual or expected future returns and claims were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable   we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments in determining the amount of the reserve we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations historically losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our reserves since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments a larger reserve might be required in the event we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate we would record a credit or a charge to selling and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 14 inventory reserves   we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales contingent payments under endorsement contracts   a significant portion of our demand creation advertising and promotion expense relates to payments under endorsement contracts in general endorsement payments are expensed uniformly over the term of the contract however certain contract elements may be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circumstances of each individual contract   certain contracts provide for contingent payments to endorsers based upon specific achievements in their sports eg winning a championship we record selling and administrative expense for these amounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal   certain contracts provide for payments based upon endorsers maintaining a level of performance in their sport over an extended period of time eg maintaining a top ranking in a sport for a year these amounts are reported in selling and administrative expense when we determine that it is probable that the specified level of performance will be maintained throughout the period in these instances to the extent that actual payments to the endorser differ from our estimate due to changes in the endorser’s athletic performance increased or decreased selling and administrative expense may be reported in a future period   certain contracts provide for royalty payments to endorsers based upon a predetermined percentage of sales of particular products we expense these payments in cost of sales as the related sales are made in certain contracts we offer minimum guaranteed royalty payments for contractual obligations for which we estimate that we will not meet the minimum guaranteed amount of royalty fees through sales of product we record in selling and administrative expense the minimum guaranteed payment amount uniformly over the remaining royalty term property plant and equipment and other longlived assets   property plant and equipment including buildings equipment and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including in some cases the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over its estimated useful life changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a longlived asset should be shortened we increase depreciation expense over the remaining useful life to depreciate the asset’s net book value to its salvage value   under current accounting standards when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a longlived asset may be impaired we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists if the carrying value exceeds our estimate of future undiscounted cash flows we then calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over our estimate of its fair market value any impairment charges are recorded as other expense we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things technological changes economic conditions or changes to our business operations for fiscal 2002 no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our longlived assets including property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets has been recorded under current accounting standards however as of june 1 2002 we will adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” we expect to record an impairment charge related to the goodwill 15 and other intangible assets of our subsidiaries bauer nike hockey inc and colehaan holdings inc in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 see “recently issued accounting standards” below 

hedge accounting for derivatives   we use forward exchange contracts and option contracts to hedge certain anticipated foreign currency exchange transactions as well as any resulting receivable or payable balance when specific criteria required by sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” have been met changes in fair values of hedge contracts relating to anticipated transactions are recorded in other comprehensive income rather than current earnings until the underlying hedged transaction affects current earnings in most cases this results in gains and losses on hedge derivatives being released from other comprehensive income into current earnings some time after the maturity of the derivative one of the criteria for this accounting treatment is that the forward exchange contract amount should not be in excess of specifically identified anticipated transactions by their very nature our estimates of anticipated transactions may fluctuate over time and may ultimately vary from actual transactions when anticipated transaction estimates or actual transaction amounts decrease below hedged levels or when the timing of transactions changes significantly we are required to reclassify at least a portion of the cumulative changes in fair values of the related hedge contracts from other comprehensive income to other income expense during the quarter in which such changes occur once an anticipated transaction estimate or actual transaction amount decreases below hedged levels we make adjustments to the related hedge contract in order to reduce the amount of the hedge contract to that of the revised anticipated transaction taxes   we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when necessary in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain at least quarterly we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made   in addition we have not recorded us income tax expense for foreign earnings that we have declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore thus reducing our overall income tax expense the amount of earnings designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore is based upon the actual deployment of such earnings in our offshore assets and our expectations of the future cash needs of our us and foreign entities income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of foreign earnings to be repatriated   in the event actual cash needs of our us entities exceed our current expectations or the actual cash needs of our foreign entities are less than expected we may need to repatriate foreign earnings which have been designated as indefinitely reinvested offshore this would result in additional income tax expense being recorded   we take a conservative approach in determining the amount of foreign earnings to declare as reinvested offshore as required by us generally accepted accounting principles the presumption is that such earnings will be repatriated in the future in order to overcome this presumption we carefully review all factors which drive the ultimate disposition of such foreign earnings and apply stringent standards to overcoming the presumption of repatriation despite this conservative approach because the determination involves our future plans and expectations of future events there is a possibility that amounts declared as indefinitely reinvested offshore may ultimately be repatriated conversely this conservative approach may result in accumulated foreign earnings for which us income taxes have been provided being determined in the future to be indefinitely reinvested offshore in this latter case our income tax expense would be reduced in the year of such determination   on an interim basis we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year this 16 continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year when this occurs we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate provision equals the expected annual rate 

other contingencies   in the ordinary course of business we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships product liability claims trademark rights and a variety of other matters we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts therefore actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain currently we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations however if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred results of operations 

 

  

 

   net income increased 133 over fiscal 2001 from 5897 million to 6683 million excluding an aftertax loss of 50 million related to the cumulative effect of the adoption of sfas no 133 “accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities” diluted earnings per share before the effect of the accounting change improved 139 from 216 to 246 these increases reflected a 104 increase in income before income taxes and a 17 point decrease in our effective income tax rate the increase in income before income taxes was due to increased revenues improved gross margins and lower interest and other expenses partially offset by a slight increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues   fiscal 2002 revenues were the highest in our history reflecting increased nike brand sales in all of our geographic regions in the us nike brand revenues increased 20 for the fiscal year driven by increased sales of apparel and equipment the increased sales in apparel reflected higher demand for inline products particularly for nike brand and brand jordan basketball apparel more than offsetting the effect of the expiration of our apparel license agreement with the national football league last year in equipment our rapidly growing golf business drove a 217 increase for the year   us footwear revenues declined 07 versus fiscal 2001 while inline sales of footwear increased compared to last year particularly in the midrange price segment closeout sales decreased significantly the reduction in closeout sales reflected both our efforts to limit the availability of closeout products in the marketplace in order to build overall profitability and relatively high levels of closeout sales in the last half of fiscal 2001 due to supply chain system disruptions discussed further below in the fiscal 2001 compared to 17 fiscal 2000 section as in the apparel business sales of nike brand and brand jordan basketball footwear products were the primary drivers of increased wholesale sales of inline footwear during the year 

  in fiscal 2002 nike brand revenues from our international regions continued to grow versus the prior year both as a percentage of total company revenues and in total dollars these revenues represented 456 of total company revenues as compared to 446 in fiscal 2001 revenues from our international regions were 45 billion as compared to 42 billion in fiscal 2001 a 66 increase had the us dollar remained constant with the prior year these international revenues would have increased 124 and consolidated revenues would have increased 69 compared to 43 growth as reported   increased revenues in each of our international regions resulted from higher demand for products in all nike brand businesses footwear apparel and equipment revenues in our europe middle east and africa emea region increased for the eighth consecutive year fiscal 2002 reported revenues in emea increased by 57 over fiscal 2001 a 96 increase in constant dollars in our asia pacific region reported revenues grew 92 a 193 increase in constant dollars the americas region grew reported revenues 54 an 119 increase in constant dollars despite a dropoff in sales in argentina during the second half of the year due to that country’s economic crisis   in fiscal 2002 other revenue which primarily includes revenues from bauer nike hockey cole haan and hurley increased 68 to 4657 million   foot locker inc is our largest single customer and represented 109 of our worldwide revenues in fiscal 2002 foot locker has expressed its intention to reduce the emphasis of its us business on higherpriced premium footwear and place more focus on moderatelypriced offerings due to this change in strategy foot locker’s futures orders in the us for the holiday season scheduled for delivery from september through november 2002 decreased significantly versus the same period in the previous year in spite of the reduction in orders from foot locker total us futures orders for the september to november period are down only 23 versus the prior year and worldwide futures orders for the same period increased 30 versus fiscal 2002   the impact of lower orders from foot locker for the september to november period was largely included in the june to november futures orders reported in our june 27 2002 press release however additional changes in november orders from foot locker reduced the overall growth of worldwide futures for the sixmonth period by approximately 30 basis points to 63   although we expect foot locker to continue to be an important retail partner for nike second half us footwear orders from this customer will likely be significantly below the prior year we are aggressively pursuing incremental sales across our business as we work to offset these declines and achieve our worldwide revenue growth goals for the year we believe there continues to be strong consumer demand for highend performance footwear this segment has always been central to the success of the nike brand therefore we will continue to work aggressively with those retailers who are focused on serving this market while the success of these efforts over the next few quarters is uncertain we remain confident in the longterm strength of our brand and our business   worldwide futures advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2002 were 63 higher than such orders booked in the comparable period of fiscal 2002 the percentage growth in futures orders is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of revenue growth in subsequent periods this is because the mix of orders can shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause differences in the comparisons between future orders and actual revenues finally a significant portion of our revenues are not derived from futures orders including wholesale sales of equipment us licensed team apparel bauer nike hockey cole haan hurley and retail sales across all brands in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 we expect that revenue growth will lag futures order growth reflecting lower closeout sales versus the first quarter of fiscal 2002 and lower retail sales versus the same period last year as us retail sales have remained at relatively low levels since the terrorist attacks of september 11 2001 18   the breakdown of revenues follows    our gross margin percentage improved 30 basis points from 390 in fiscal 2001 to 393 in fiscal 2002 factors contributing to the improved gross margin percentage versus the prior year were as follows    selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenues from 283 in fiscal 2001 to 285 in fiscal 2002 operating overhead increased 60 during fiscal 2002 largely as a result of our continued investment in initiatives intended to generate future revenues and profits significant drivers of the increased operating overhead included increased investment in our supply chain initiative additional headcount to support our growing golf and european businesses additional expense for compensation programs tied to our 19 profitability and stock performance and costs for additional retail stores primarily in our emea and asia pacific regions 

  the supply chain initiative refers to our ongoing development of systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain this initiative is intended to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions margins by lowering closeouts and distribution costs and cash flow by reducing inventories the ultimate level of benefit to revenues margins and cash flows if any will not be known until the new systems and processes have been implemented worldwide over the next few years during fiscal 2002 we implemented new systems and processes for certain global functions and for our us business and we plan on implementing new systems and processes in emea during fiscal 2003 in fiscal 2003 we will continue to invest in the implementation of the new systems worldwide and support our existing system infrastructure for those businesses where we have not yet implemented the new systems   demand creation expense was 10279 million in fiscal 2002 versus 9982 million in fiscal 2001 which was consistent between years as a percentage of revenues our fiscal 2002 demand creation expense reflected incremental spending for our world cup 2002 marketing campaign which occurred primarily in our international regions in fiscal 2003 we expect demand creation expense to grow slightly faster than revenues reflecting the continuation of the world cup 2002 campaign into the first quarter of fiscal 2003 in addition we have entered into a longterm license and endorsement agreement with manchester united one of the premier soccer clubs in the world which begins in august 2002 payments under this contract will result in additional demand creation expense   interest expense decreased 189 from 587 million to 476 million in fiscal 2002 due to lower interest rates in the current year and lower average debt levels as we used operating free cash flow to reduce debt   other income expense was a net expense of 30 million versus a net expense of 341 million in fiscal 2001 consistent with previous years other incomeexpense included interest income profit sharing expense goodwill amortization certain foreign currency conversion gains and losses and asset disposal gains losses net other expense decreased between years as the fiscal 2001 amount included charges for contractual settlements that did not recur in fiscal 2002 in addition fiscal 2002 other income expense included credits related to the favorable resolution of some outstanding claims   our fiscal 2002 effective tax rate was 343 as compared to 360 in fiscal 2001 as required by us generally accepted accounting principles we do not accrue for us tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2002 is primarily the result of a larger amount of foreign earnings permanently invested offshore in fiscal 2002 than in fiscal 2001 

 

   net income increased 18 over fiscal 2000 from 5791 million to 5897 million although consolidated revenues increased 55 over fiscal 2000 income before income taxes was essentially flat as pretax profit margins decreased due to a lower gross margin percentage higher interest expense and increased other expenses partially offset by lower selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues despite flat income before income taxes net income increased due to a lower effective tax rate diluted earnings per share increased 43 from 207 to 216 the percentage increase in earnings per share was higher than that of net income primarily due to share repurchases in fiscal years 2000 and 2001   nike brand revenues in the us region increased 18 as compared to fiscal 2000 while nike brand revenues in our international regions increased 98 had the us dollar remained constant with the prior year these international revenues would have increased 186 and consolidated revenues would have advanced 93 in the us region our largest market segment the 18 increase in revenues reflected a 92 increase in apparel sales and a 544 increase in equipment sales offset by a 42 decrease in footwear sales the increases in apparel and equipment reflected stronger demand for inline products the increase in the equipment product line reflected increases in a variety of sports equipment categories including golf football and baseball products as well as socks bags and eyewear the decrease in footwear reflected lower demand particularly in the midrange price segment and supply chain disruptions resulting from the implementation of 20 a new global demand and supply planning system the supply chain disruptions resulted in product excesses as well as product shortages and late deliveries in the second half of the fiscal 2001 

  revenues from our international regions were 42 billion as compared to 39 billion in fiscal 2000 fiscal 2001 revenues in emea increased over fiscal 2000 by 74 to 25848 million a 193 increase in constant dollars in our asia pacific region revenues grew 162 a 208 increase in constant dollars the americas region grew revenues 91 an 114 increase in constant dollars   in fiscal 2001 other revenue increased 72 to 4359 million   our gross margin percentage declined 90 basis points from 399 in fiscal 2000 to 390 in fiscal 2001 factors contributing to the lower gross margin percentage were as follows    selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues from 290 to 283 demand creation expense decreased as a percentage of revenues from 108 to 105 fiscal 2001 demand creation expense was 9982 million versus 9741 million in fiscal 2000 the overall decrease in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues reflected cost containment measures both in marketing and operational areas while implementing these measures to control selling and administrative expense growth we also continued to invest in operational initiatives designed to create future revenues and profits these initiatives included the expansion of nikeowned retail outlets the development of ecommerce applications and systems and processes supporting our worldwide supply chain our level of investment in these areas in fiscal 2001 was comparable to our level of investment in fiscal 2000   interest expense increased 304 from 450 million to 587 million due to higher average debt levels in fiscal 2001 versus fiscal 2000 during fiscal 2000 we increased debt to fund capital expenditures and higher working capital requirements and to repurchase common stock although our debt balance decreased during fiscal 2001 the average debt balance for fiscal 2001 remained above the prior year   other income expense was a net expense of 341 million versus a net expense of 207 million in fiscal 2000 significant amounts included in other income expense were interest income profit sharing expense goodwill amortization certain foreign currency conversion gains and losses asset disposal gains and losses and charges for contractual settlements   our fiscal 2001 effective tax rate was 360 as compared to 370 in fiscal 2000 as discussed above we do not accrue for us tax liability on foreign earnings permanently invested offshore the lower effective tax rate in fiscal 2001 was primarily the result of lower taxes on a larger amount of foreign earnings that were permanently invested offshore in fiscal 2001 than in fiscal 2000 as well as additional research tax credits recently issued accounting standards   in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 141 “business combinations” fas 141 and sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” fas 142 fas 141 requires the purchase method of accounting to be used for all business combinations initiated after june 30 2001 fas 141 also requires a more rigorous identification of intangible assets which must be 21 recognized and reported separately from goodwill the adoption of fas 141 will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 

  fas 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized but instead be measured for impairment at least annually or when events indicate that an impairment exists our adoption date is june 1 2002 as of that date amortization of outstanding goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets will cease as a result of the elimination of this amortization other expense will decrease by approximately 13 million annually beginning in fiscal 2003   as required by fas 142 we will perform impairment tests on goodwill and other indefinitelived intangible assets as of the adoption date thereafter we will perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other indefinitelived intangible assets might be impaired in connection with the fas 142 indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test we will utilize the required onestep method to determine whether an impairment exists as of the adoption date the test will consist of a comparison of the estimated fair values of indefinitelived assets with the carrying amounts if the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds our estimate of its fair value we will recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess   in connection with the fas 142 transitional goodwill impairment test we will utilize the required twostep method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption date to accomplish this we will identify our reporting units and determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning our assets and liabilities including the existing goodwill and intangible assets to those reporting units as of the adoption date we will then estimate the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit to the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit we then will perform the second step of the transitional impairment test   where necessary in the second step we will compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill both of which will be measured as of the adoption date the implied fair value of goodwill will be determined by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with fas 141 the residual fair value after this allocation will be the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill we will record a transitional impairment loss for any excess of the carrying value of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit over the implied fair value   we have estimated that we will likely incur a transitional impairment loss of approximately 270 million related to our bauer nike hockey and cole haan subsidiaries reflecting that the fair values we have estimated for these subsidiaries are less than the carrying values including goodwill this expected transitional impairment loss will be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of income during the first quarter of fiscal 2003   in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” fas 144 this statement supersedes sfas no 121 “accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be disposed of” fas 121 and amends accounting principles board statement no 30 “reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions” apb 30 fas 144 requires that longlived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less costs to sell fas 144 retains the fundamental provisions of fas 121 for a recognition and measurement of the impairment of longlived assets to be held and used and b measurement of longlived assets to be disposed of by sale this statement also retains apb 30’s requirement that companies report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations all provisions of this statement will be effective for us on june 1 2003 we do not expect that the adoption of fas 144 will have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 22 liquidity and capital resources 

 

   cash provided by operations was 10815 million in fiscal 2002 compared to 6565 million in fiscal 2001 our primary source of operating cash flow was net income earned during the year of 6633 million operating cash flow increased significantly over the prior year due to reduced investment in certain working capital components during fiscal 2002 which generated positive operating cash flow   cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2002 was 3028 million compared to 3423 million invested during fiscal 2001 the total for fiscal 2002 related primarily to capital expenditures for computer equipment and software driven by our supply chain initiative and investments in new retail outlets in addition we acquired all of the assets and substantially all of the liabilities of hurley international llc a teen lifestyle brand company during fiscal 2003 we will continue to incur expenditures related to systems improvements most notably the supply chain initiative retail expansion and investments in our worldwide warehouse facilities   cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2002 was 4782 million up from 3499 million in the prior year this amount included uses of cash for dividends to shareholders a net reduction in debt and share repurchases these uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options   the share repurchases were part of a 10 billion share repurchase program that began in fiscal 2001 after completion of a fouryear 10 billion program in fiscal 2000 in fiscal 2002 we repurchased 43 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 2377 million to date under the current program we have purchased a total of 83 million shares of nike’s class b common stock for 3947 million we expect to fund the current program from operating cash flow the timing and the amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions 

 

   our significant longterm contractual obligations as of may 31 2002 are as follows    the amounts listed for endorsement contracts represent approximate amounts of base compensation and minimum guaranteed royalty fees we are obligated to pay athlete and sport team endorsers of our products actual payments under some contracts are likely be higher than the amounts listed as these contracts provide for bonuses to be paid to the endorsers based upon athletic achievements in future periods actual payments under some contracts may also be lower as a limited number of contracts include provisions for reduced payments if athlete performance declines in future periods   in addition to the cash payments disclosed above we are obligated to furnish the endorsers with nike products for their use it is not possible to determine how much we will spend on this product on an annual basis as the contracts do not stipulate a specific amount of cash to be spent on the product the amount of product provided to the endorsers will depend on many factors including general playing conditions the number of sporting events in which they participate and our own decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives in addition the costs to design develop source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers   an outsourcing contractor provides us with information technology operations management services through 2006 the amount of the payments in future years depends on our level of monthly use of the different elements of the contractor’s services if we were to terminate the entire contract as of may 31 2002 we would 23 be required to provide the contractor with four months notice and pay a termination liability of 226 million our monthly payments to the contractor currently are approximately 6 million 

  we also have the following outstanding shortterm debt obligations as of may 31 2002 please refer to the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements note 4 — shortterm borrowings and credit lines  for further description and interest rates related to the below shortterm debt obligations    as of may 31 2002 letters of credit of 8084 million were outstanding for the purchase of inventories all letters of credit generally expire within one year 

 

   we have an effective shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission sec under which 10 billion in debt securities are available to be issued on may 29 2002 we commenced a mediumterm note program under the shelf registration that allows us to issue up to 5000 million in mediumterm notes as our capital needs dictate we entered into this program to provide additional liquidity to meet our working capital and general corporate cash requirements as of may 31 2002 we had not issued any debt securities under the shelf registration   subsequent to may 31 2002 we issued a total of 90 million in notes under the mediumterm note program the notes have coupon rates that range from 480 to 566 the maturities range from july 9 2007 to august 7 2012 for 75 million of the notes we simultaneously entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive fixed interest payments at the same rate as the notes and pay variable interest payments based on the sixmonth london inter bank offering rate libor plus a spread each swap has the same notional amount and maturity date as its respective note after issuance of these notes 9100 million remains available to be issued under our shelf registration we may issue additional notes under the shelf registration in fiscal 2003 depending on working capital and general corporate needs   as of may 31 2001 we had a 7500 million 364day committed credit facility and a 5000 million multiyear committed credit facility in place with a group of banks in november 2001 we renewed the 364day facility in the amount of 6000 million thus our current total availability under these two bank facilities is 11 billion we currently have no amounts outstanding under these facilities the 6000 million facility matures on november 15 2002 and can be extended 364 days on each maturity date the 5000 million facility matures on november 17 2005 and once a year it can be extended for one additional year based on our current longterm senior unsecured debt ratings of a and a2 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the 6000 million facility would be the prevailing libor plus 024 and the interest rate charged on any outstanding borrowings on the 5000 million facility would be the prevailing libor plus 022 the facility fees for the 6000 million and the 5000 million facilities are 006 and 008 respectively of the total commitment   if our longterm debt rating were to decline the facility fees and interest rates under our committed credit facilities would increase conversely if our longterm debt rating improves the facility fees and interest rates would decrease changes in our longterm debt rating would not trigger acceleration of maturity of any then outstanding borrowings or any future borrowings under the committed credit facilities however under 24 these committed credit facilities we have agreed to various covenants these covenants include limits on our disposal of fixed assets and the amount of debt secured by liens we may incur and set a minimum ratio of net worth to indebtedness in the event we were to have any borrowings outstanding under these facilities failed to meet any covenant and were unable to obtain a waiver from a majority of the banks any borrowings would become immediately due and payable as of may 31 2002 we were in full compliance with each of these covenants and believe it is unlikely we will fail to meet any of these covenants in the future 

  liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which there was 3383 million and 7100 million outstanding at may 31 2002 and may 31 2001 respectively we currently have shortterm debt ratings of a1 and p1 from standard and poor’s corporation and moody’s investor services respectively   we currently believe that cash generated by operations together with access to external sources of funds as described above will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital needs   dividends per share of common stock for fiscal 2002 were 048 the same as in fiscal 2001 we have paid a dividend every quarter since february 1984 we review our dividend policy from time to time however based upon current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing to pay a quarterly dividend 


 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes   we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our international sales production and funding activities our foreign currency risk management objective is to reduce the variability of local entity cash flows as a result of exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed transactions as well as certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables including third party or intercompany transactions   when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the exposure and market conditions generally all anticipated and firmly committed transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months although at may 31 2002 we had forward contracts hedging anticipated transactions that will be recognized in as many as 24 months the majority of the contracts expiring in more than twelve months relate to the anticipated purchase of inventory by our japanese subsidiary we use forward contracts and crosscurrency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments under intercompany loan agreements when intercompany loans are hedged it is typically for their expected duration which in some circumstances may be in excess of five years hedged transactions are principally denominated in european currencies japanese yen canadian dollars korean won mexican pesos australian dollars and new taiwan dollars   our earnings are also exposed to movements in short and longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper and bank loans and have entered into interest rate swaps under which we receive fixed interest and pay variable interest market risk measurement   we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk var our marketsensitive derivative and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency forward contracts foreign currency option contracts crosscurrency swaps interest rate swaps intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt 25   we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a “variance covariance” technique these interrelationships are a function of foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes over the preceding one year the value of foreign currency options does not change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the “delta” and “gamma” to changes in the underlying currency rate this calculation reflects the impact of foreign currency rate fluctuations on the derivative instruments only and hence does not include the impact of such rate fluctuations on the underlying based transactions that are anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts and loans receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the var calculation including those which are hedged by these instruments   the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and hedge percentages timing and other factors   the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on our foreign currency sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 137 million and 189 million at may 31 2002 and may 31 2001 respectively the reduction in var as of may 31 2002 occurred due to the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2002 var computation versus the effect of currency volatility on existing trades on the may 31 2001 var computation such a hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged the average monthly change in the fair values of foreign currency forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments was 429 million and 224 million for fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2001 respectively   details of other marketsensitive financial instruments and derivative financial instruments not included in the var calculation above are provided in the table below except the interest rate swaps which are described in the last paragraph of this section these instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar denominated debt crosscurrency swaps and interest rate swaps for debt obligations the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates we have excluded the crosscurrency swaps from the foreign exchange risk category because these instruments eliminate all foreign currency exposure in the cash flows of a euro denominated intercompany loan we have included these crosscurrency swaps in the interest rate risk category but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category because the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation for the crosscurrency swaps the table presents both the euro swap payable and us dollar swap receivable and the respective pay and receive interest rates all information is presented in us dollar equivalents in millions except interest rates   intercompany loans and related interest amounts eliminate in consolidation intercompany loans are generally hedged against foreign exchange risk through the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties   the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and are accounted for by two of our japanese subsidiaries accordingly the monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss upon the consolidation of these subsidiaries   there was not a significant change in debt or crosscurrency swap market risks during fiscal 2002 the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies was 6472 million at may 31 2001 which is the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination the us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was outstanding at may 31 2001 was 1811 million 26 versus a carrying value of 1910 million at that date the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar denominated debt the euro swap payable and the us dollar swap receivable as of may 31 2001 were 2562 million 1794 million and 2664 million respectively versus carrying values of 2496 million 1726 million and 2500 million respectively at that date 

  in august 2001 we issued a 250 million corporate bond maturing in august 2006 with a fixed interest rate of 55 in november 2001 we entered into receivefixed payvariable interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure related to this bond the interest rate swaps have an aggregate notional amount of 250 million maturing in august 2006 the receivefixed rates on the swaps match the fixed rate on the bond and the payvariable rates are based on the threemonth libor rates plus a spread as a result of the interest rate swap agreements our effective interest rate on the 250 million corporate bond was 33 as of may 31 2002 the difference between the carrying amounts and fair value of the corporate bond and related interest rate swaps was 18 million at may 31 2002  27  special note regarding forwardlooking statements and analyst reports   certain written and oral statements other than purely historical information including estimates projections statements relating to nike’s business plans objectives and expected operating results and the assumptions upon which those statements are based made or incorporated by reference from time to time by nike or its representatives in this report other reports filings with the securities and exchange commission press releases conferences or otherwise are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 forwardlooking statements include without limitation any statement that may predict forecast indicate or imply future results performance or achievements and may contain the words “believe” “anticipate” “expect” “estimate” “project” “will be” “will continue” “will likely result” or words or phrases of similar meaning forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forwardlooking statements the risks and uncertainties are detailed from time to time in reports filed by nike with the sec including forms 8k 10q and 10k and include among others the following international national and local general economic and market conditions the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear apparel and equipment markets intense competition among designers marketers distributors and sellers of athletic footwear apparel and equipment for consumers and endorsers demographic changes changes in consumer preferences popularity of particular designs categories of products and sports seasonal and geographic demand for nike products difficulties in anticipating or forecasting changes in consumer preferences consumer demand for nike products and the various market factors described above difficulties in implementing operating and maintaining nike’s increasingly complex information systems and controls including without limitation the systems related to demand and supply planning and inventory control interruptions in data and communications systems fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results including without limitation the fact that advance “futures” orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and atonce orders the ability of nike to sustain manage or forecast its growth and inventories the size timing and mix of purchases of nike’s products new product development and introduction the ability to secure and protect trademarks patents and other intellectual property performance and reliability of products customer service adverse publicity the loss of significant customers or suppliers dependence on distributors business disruptions increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines increases in borrowing costs due to any decline in our debt ratings changes in business strategy or development plans general risks associated with doing business outside the united states including without limitation import duties tariffs quotas and political and economic instability changes in government regulations liability and other claims asserted against nike the ability to 28 attract and retain qualified personnel and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports

     financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in
note 16 of the consolidated financial statements on page 41

     we experience moderate fluctuations in aggregate sales volume during the
year however the mix of product sales may vary considerably from time to time
as a result of changes in seasonal and geographic demand for particular types of
footwear apparel and equipment

     because nike is a consumer products company the relative popularity of
various sports and fitness activities and changing design trends affect the
demand for our products we must therefore respond to trends and shifts in
consumer preferences by adjusting the mix of existing product offerings
developing new products styles and categories and influencing sports and
fitness preferences through aggressive marketing this is a continuing risk
failure to timely and adequately respond could have a material adverse affect on
our sales and profitability

through november of 2001 based upon historical data we expect that
approximately 95 percent of these orders will be filled in that time period
although the orders may be cancelable

product research and development

     we believe that our research and development efforts are a key factor in
our past and future success technical innovation in the design of footwear
apparel and athletic equipment receive continued emphasis as nike strives to
produce products that reduce or eliminate injury aid athletic performance and
maximize comfort

     in addition to nikes own staff of specialists in the areas of
biomechanics exercise physiology engineering industrial design and related
fields we also utilize research committees and advisory boards made up of
athletes coaches trainers equipment managers orthopedists podiatrists and
other experts who consult with us and review designs materials and concepts for
product improvement employee athletes weartest and evaluate products during
the design and development process

manufacturing

     in fiscal 2001 approximately five percent of total nike brand apparel
production for sale to the united states market was manufactured in the united
states by independent contract manufacturers most of which are located in the
southern states the remainder was manufactured by independent contractors
located in 28 countries most of this apparel production occurred in bangladesh
china hong kong india indonesia malaysia mexico pakistan the philippines
sri lanka taiwan and thailand substantially all of our apparel production for
sale to the international market was manufactured outside the us our largest
single apparel supplier accounted for approximately eight percent of total
fiscal 2001 apparel production

     virtually all of our footwear is produced outside of the united states in
fiscal 2001 contract suppliers in the following countries manufactured the
following percentages of total nike brand footwear

we also have manufacturing agreements with independent factories in argentina
brazil mexico south africa and zimbabwe to manufacture footwear for sale
within those countries our largest single footwear supplier accounted for
approximately 6 percent of total fiscal 2001 footwear production

     the principal materials used in our footwear products are natural and
synthetic rubber plastic compounds foam cushioning materials nylon leather
canvas and polyurethane films used to make airsole cushioning components nike
ihm inc a whollyowned subsidiary of nike is our sole supplier of the
airsole cushioning components used in footwear the principal materials used in
our apparel products are natural and synthetic fabrics and threads plastic and
metal hardware and specialized performance fabrics designed to repel rain
retain heat or efficiently transport body moisture nike and its contractors
and suppliers buy raw materials in bulk most raw materials are available in the
countries where manufacturing takes place we have thus far experienced little
difficulty in satisfying our raw material requirements

     our international operations are subject to the usual risks of doing
business abroad such as possible revaluation of currencies export duties
quotas restrictions on the transfer of funds and in certain parts of the
world political instability see trade legislation below we have not to
date been materially affected by any such risk but cannot predict the
likelihood of such developments occurring we believe that we have the ability
to develop over a period of time adequate alternative sources of supply for
the products obtained from

                                        4
page   7

our present suppliers outside of the united states if events prevented us from
acquiring products from our suppliers in a particular country our footwear
operations could be temporarily disrupted and we could experience an adverse
financial impact however we believe that we could eliminate any such
disruption within a period of no more than 12 months and that any adverse
impact would therefore be of a shortterm nature we believe that our
principal competitors are subject to similar risks

     all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united
states and other countries are subject to duties collected by customs
authorities customs information submitted by us is routinely subject to review
by customs authorities we are unable to predict whether additional customs
duties quotas or other restrictions may be imposed on the importation of our
products in the future the enactment of any such duties quotas or restrictions
could result in increases in the cost of our products generally and might
adversely affect the sales or profitability of nike and the imported footwear
and apparel industry as a whole

     since 1972 nissho iwai american corporation niac a subsidiary of
nissho iwai corporation a large japanese trading company has performed
significant importexport financing services for us currently niac provides
such financing services with respect to more than 80 percent of the nike
products sold outside of the united states europe and japan any failure of
niac to provide these services could disrupt our ability to acquire products
from our suppliers and to deliver products to our customers outside of the
united states europe and japan if prolonged such a disruption could result in
cancelled orders that would adversely affect sales and profitability we believe
that any such disruption would be short term in duration due to the ready
availability of alternative sources of financing at competitive rates our
current agreements with niac expire on may 31 2003

trade legislation

     our nonus operations are subject to the usual risks of doing business
abroad such as the imposition of import quotas or antidumping duties in 1994
the european union eu commission imposed quotas on certain types of footwear
manufactured in china these quotas replaced national quotas that had previously
been in effect in several member states footwear designed for use in sporting
activities meeting certain technical criteria and having a cif cost insurance
and freight price above 9 euros special technology athletic footwear or
staf is excluded from the quotas as a result of the staf exclusion and the
amount of quota made available to us the quotas have not to date had a
material effect on our business

     in 1995 the eu commission at the request of european footwear
manufacturers initiated two antidumping investigations covering footwear
imported from the peoples republic of china indonesia and thailand as a
result in october 1997 the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on
certain textile upper footwear imported from china and indonesia in february
1998 the commission imposed definitive antidumping duties on certain synthetic
and leather upper footwear originating in china indonesia and thailand in the
case of textile upper footwear the antidumping duties do not cover sports
footwear in the case of synthetic and leather upper footwear the antidumping
duties do not cover footwear meeting the staf technical criteria and with a cif
price above 57 euros as a result the antidumping duties for synthetic and
leather upper footwear apply only to low cost footwear in our case these
duties primarily affect childrens shoes and low cost sandals while the
exclusions are subject to some interpretation by customs authorities we believe
that most of our footwear sourced in the target countries for sale in the eu
fits within the exclusions we have also shifted the production of these types
of footwear to other countries accordingly the antidumping duties have not
had a material effect on our business

     while we have no reason to believe that the sports footwear exclusions from
the quotas which will remain in place through 2004 and antidumping duties
will be eliminated the eu commission in june 2000 issued an amendment to the
explanatory notes to the eus customs nomenclature cn the amendment which
is not legally binding interprets some of the technical criteria for the staf
exclusion and the footwear types that can be classified as for use in sporting
activity the amendment could restrict the scope of the staf exclusion from the
quotas and also the sports footwear exclusions from the two eu antidumping
measures in addition the commission has altered its administration of the
quota system in a manner that

                                        5
page   8

would preclude national customs authorities from opting to grant the exclusion
to certain other footwear types notably sandals

     we cannot assess the full impact of the amendment to the cn explanatory
notes until the national customs administrations clarify their national
application of its nonbinding provisions in the meantime we are assessing the
legal issues relating to both the commissions action in issuing the amendment
and its related administrative action concerning other footwear originating in
china we will closely monitor further developments and will seek by individual
action and through relevant trade associations to prevent interpretations and
administrative measures that would subject a greater portion of our products to
the quotas and antidumping duties

     if the eu trade measures become substantially more restrictive as a result
of the recent commission measures we would recommend that our european
subsidiaries consider in addition to possible legal remedies shifting the
production of such footwear to other countries in order to maintain competitive
pricing we believe that we are prepared to deal effectively with any such
change of circumstances and that any adverse impact would be of a temporary
nature we continue to closely monitor international restrictions and maintain
our multicountry sourcing strategy and contingency plans we believe that our
major competitors stand in much the same position regarding these trade
measures

     the peoples republic of china china is a material source of footwear
production for nike as part of chinas bid to join the world trade organization
wto and after the united states and china reached a comprehensive trade
agreement former president clinton submitted legislation to congress which
would grant permanent nondiscriminatory normal trade relations ntr
formerly most favored nation trading status to china in 2000 congress
approved the legislation but because china had not finished its accession
negotiations with the wto in june 2001 president bush extended ntr to china on
an annual basis that decision was recently supported by congress once china
completes the terms of accession to the wto congress has provided the president
with the authority to grant china permanent ntr bringing china into the wto and
providing permanent ntr to china will eventually reduce barriers to producing
products in exporting products from and marketing and selling products within
china

     we are also currently sourcing footwear and apparel products from factories
in vietnam from 1995 to 1998 former president clinton took several steps to
normalize economic and diplomatic relations between the united states and
vietnam the presidents actions were steps toward restoration of full trade
relations which includes the united states granting nondiscriminatory ntr
trading status to vietnam which would result in lower tariffs between the two
countries in july 2000 the united states and vietnam signed a comprehensive
bilateral trade agreement which would among other things provide reciprocal
ntr between the two countries in june 2001 that agreement was submitted to
congress for consideration if approved by the us congress and the vietnamese
national assembly the united states will grant an annual extension of ntr to
vietnam this grant must be renewed annually by the president and reviewed by
the congress we currently believe that congress will consider the trade
agreement by the end of this calendar year if congress approves the trade
agreement the grant of ntr trading status for vietnam could expand our
production and marketing opportunities in vietnam and allow for vietnamese
sourced product to enter the united states at ntr tariff rates

competition

     the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry is keenly competitive
in the united states and on a worldwide basis we compete internationally with
an increasing number of athletic and leisure shoe companies athletic and
leisure apparel companies sports equipment companies and large companies
having diversified lines of athletic and leisure shoes apparel and equipment
including reebok adidas and others the intense competition and the rapid
changes in technology and consumer preferences in the markets for athletic and
leisure footwear and apparel and athletic equipment constitute significant
risk factors in our operations

     nike is the largest seller of athletic footwear and athletic apparel in the
world performance and reliability of shoes apparel and equipment new product
development price product identity through

                                        6

marketing and promotion and customer support and service are important aspects
of competition in the athletic footwear apparel and equipment industry to help
market our products we contract with prominent and influential athletes
coaches teams colleges and sports leagues to endorse our brands and use our
products and we actively sponsor sporting events and clinics we believe that
we are competitive in all of these areas

trademarks and patents

     we utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe that having
distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in
creating a market for our goods in identifying the company and in
distinguishing our goods from the goods of others we consider our niker and
swoosh designr trademarks to be among our most valuable assets and we have
registered these trademarks in over 100 countries in addition we own many
other trademarks which we utilize in marketing our products we continue to
vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement

     nike has an exclusive worldwide license to make and sell footwear using
patented air technology the process utilizes pressurized gas encapsulated in
polyurethane some of the early nike airr patents have expired which may
enable competitors to use certain types of like technology subsequent nike air
patents will not expire for several years we also have a number of patents
covering components and features used in various athletic and leisure shoes we
believe that our success depends primarily upon skills in design research and
development production and marketing rather than upon our patent position
however we have followed a policy of filing applications for united states and
foreign patents on inventions designs and improvements that we deem valuable

employees

     we had approximately 22700 employees at may 31 2001 management considers
its relationship with employees to be excellent with the exception of bauer
nike hockey inc our employees are not represented by a union of bauer nike
hockeys north american employees approximately 65 percent or fewer than 450
are covered by three union collective bargaining agreements with three separate
bargaining units and of bauer nike hockeys approximately 170 employees in

interruption of operations due to labor disagreements

item 3 legal proceedings

     except as described below there are no material pending legal proceedings
other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business to which we
are a party or of which any of our property is the subject

     the company and certain of its officers and directors were named as
defendants in four substantially identical securities class actions filed in the
us district court for the district of oregon on march 9 14 20 and april 4
2001 on july 23 2001 the cases were consolidated as in re nike inc
securities litigation cv01332k the consolidated amended complaint seeks
unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class consisting of purchasers of
the companys stock during the period december 20 2000 through february 26
2001 plaintiffs allege that the defendants made false and misleading statements
about the companys actual and expected business and financial performance in
violation of federal securities laws plaintiffs further allege that certain
individual defendants sold company stock while in possession of material
nonpublic information while the litigation is in a very preliminary stage
based on the available information we do not currently anticipate that the
action will have a material financial impact we believe the claims are without
merit and we intend to vigorously defend them

010404339 was filed in the multnomah county circuit court of the state of
oregon on april 26 2001 the derivative suit was brought by certain company
shareholders allegedly on behalf of the company against certain directors and
officers of the company the derivative plaintiffs allege that these officers
and directors breached their fiduciary duties to the company by making or
causing to be made alleged misstatements about the companys actual and expected
financial performance while certain officers and directors sold company stock
and by allowing the company to be sued in the shareholder class action the
derivative plaintiffs seek compensatory and other

results of operations

fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000

     net income increased 18 over fiscal 2000 from 5791 million to 5897
million although consolidated revenues increased 55 over fiscal 2000 income
before income taxes was essentially flat as pretax profit margins decreased due
to a lower gross margin percentage higher interest expense and increased other
operating expenses partially offset by lower selling and administrative
expenses as a percent of revenue despite flat income before income taxes net
income increased due to a lower effective tax rate diluted earnings per share
increased 43 from 207 to 216 the percentage increase in earnings per
share was higher than that of net income primarily due to share repurchases in
fiscal years 2000 and 2001

     nike brand revenues in the united states region increased 18 as compared
to fiscal 2000 while nike brand revenues in our international regions increased
98 had the us dollar remained constant with the prior year these
international revenues would have increased 186 and consolidated revenues
would have advanced 93 in the united states region our largest market
segment the 18 increase in revenues reflected a 92 increase in apparel
sales and a 544 increase in equipment sales offset by a 42 decrease in
footwear sales the increases in apparel and equipment reflected stronger demand
for inline products the increase in the equipment product line reflected
increases in a variety of sports equipment categories including golf football
and baseball products as well as socks bags and eyewear the decrease in
footwear reflected lower demand particularly in the midrange price segment
and supply chain disruptions resulting from the implementation of a new global
demand and supply planning system the supply chain disruptions resulted in
product excesses as well as product shortages and late deliveries in the second
half of the fiscal year

     in fiscal 2001 nike brand revenues from our international regions
continued to grow both as a percentage of total company revenues and in total
dollars as compared to fiscal 2000 these revenues represented 446 of total
company revenues as compared to 429 in fiscal 2000 revenues from our
international regions were 42 billion as compared to 39 billion in fiscal
2000 revenues in our europe middle east and africa emea region increased
for the seventh consecutive year fiscal 2001 revenues in emea increased over
fiscal 2000 by 74 to 25848 million a 193 increase in constant dollars
in our asia pacific region revenues grew 162 a 208 increase in constant
dollars the americas region grew revenues 91 an 114 increase in constant
dollars

     in fiscal 2001 revenue from other brands increased 72 to 4359 million

     worldwide futures and advance orders for nike brand athletic footwear and
apparel scheduled for delivery from june through november 2001 were 3 higher
than such orders booked in the comparable period of fiscal 2000 the percentage
growth in these orders is not necessarily indicative of our expectation of
revenue growth in subsequent periods this is because the mix of orders can
shift between advancefutures and atonce orders in addition exchange rate
fluctuations as well as differing levels of order cancellations can cause
differences in the comparisons between future orders and actual revenues
finally a significant portion of our revenues are not derived from futures
orders including those from our equipment product line us licensed team
apparel product line retail operations and other brands including bauer nike
hockey and cole haan

     our gross margin percentage declined 90 basis points from 399 in fiscal
2000 to 390 in fiscal 2001 factors contributing to the lower gross margin
percentage were as follows

          1 the effect of the change in foreign exchange rates most notably
     the weakening of the euro against the us dollar relative to fiscal 2000

          2 a higher mix of closeout sales as well as lower margins achieved
     on closeouts primarily in footwear and licensed team apparel in the
     united states in footwear the higher mix of closeouts and lower
     closeout margins were due in part to the supply chain disruptions
     discussed above higher closeouts and lower margins in us licensed team
     apparel resulted primarily from the liquidation of national football league
     nfl team apparel due to the termination of our nfl license agreement
     this year

          3 product recalls of certain footwear models in the united states
     which resulted in product returns and writeoffs

     we expect the weakness of the euro to place additional negative pressure on
our gross margins throughout fiscal 2002 in addition we will continue to
liquidate excess inventories caused by the supply chain problems affecting
gross margins through the first half of fiscal 2002

     selling and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues
from 290 to 283 this decrease reflected cost containment measures both in
marketing and operational areas while implementing these measures to control
selling and administrative expense growth we also continued to invest in
operational initiatives designed to create future revenues and profits these
initiatives included the expansion of nikeowned retail outlets the development
of ecommerce applications and systems and processes supporting our worldwide
supply chain our level of investment in these areas was comparable to our level
of investment in fiscal 2000 the worldwide supply chain initiative is intended
to improve revenue by increasing our ability to respond to market conditions
margins by lowering closeouts and distribution costs and cash flow by

                                        14
page   17

reducing inventories the ultimate level of benefit to revenues margins and
cash flows if any will not be known until the new systems and processes have
been implemented worldwide over the next few years

     interest expense increased 304 from 450 million to 587 million due
to higher average debt levels in fiscal 2001 versus fiscal 2000 during fiscal
2000 we increased debt to fund capital expenditures and higher working capital
requirements and to repurchase common stock although our debt balance decreased
during fiscal 2001 the average debt balance for fiscal 2001 remained above the
prior year

     other incomeexpense was a net expense of 342 million versus a net
expense of 232 million in fiscal 2000 significant amounts included in other
incomeexpense were interest income profit sharing expense goodwill
amortization certain foreign currency conversion gains and losses and asset
disposal gains and losses

     our fiscal 2001 effective tax rate was 360 as compared to 370 in fiscal
2000 factors contributing to this decrease included lower taxes on a portion of
foreign earnings that have been permanently invested outside of the us and
additional research tax credits

fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999

     net income increased 283 in fiscal 2000 over fiscal 1999 from 4514
million to 5791 million excluding the impact of restructuring charge activity
in fiscal 1999 net income advanced 1004 million or 210 income before
income taxes increased due to increased revenues and an improved gross margin
partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses the increased
selling and administrative expenses in large part reflected significant
investments in new supply chain systems ecommerce initiatives and new retail
stores discussed further below the increase in net income primarily reflected
the improved income before income taxes but also reflected a lower effective
tax rate diluted earnings per share increased 318 more rapidly than net
income as a result of share repurchases during fiscal 2000 excluding the
impact of restructuring charges diluted earnings per share increased 247

     total nike revenues increased by 25 in fiscal 2000 nike brand revenues
in the united states region were flat as compared to fiscal 1999 while nike
brand revenues in our international regions increased 69 had the us dollar
remained constant with the prior year these international revenues would have
increased 119 and consolidated revenues would have advanced 45 revenue
growth in the united states was slowed by a contraction of athletic sportswear
retail space

     in fiscal 2000 nike brand revenues from our international regions
represented 429 of total company revenues and grew significantly during the
year fiscal 2000 revenues in emea increased over fiscal 1999 by 49 to
24070 million 155 in constant dollars in our asia pacific region
revenues grew 131 a 47 increase in constant dollars the americas region
grew revenues 53 72 in constant dollars

     in fiscal 2000 our gross margin percentage improved 250 basis points from
374 to 399 the key factors in the improvement of margins were as follows

          1 increased margins on inline products particularly in apparel and
     equipment

          2 reduced levels of lower margin closeout sales reflecting lower
     inventories of closeout outofseason product

          3 higher margins on closeout sales driven by the expansion of our
     network of outlet stores

     selling and administrative expenses increased 74 in fiscal 2000 to
26064 million much of the increase was driven by investments designed to
create future revenues and profits including opening new nikeowned retail
outlets development of ecommerce capability initiatives to streamline our
supply chain and the conversion of certain international markets from
independent distributorships to direct nike ownership higher bad debt expense
due to the bankruptcy filing of one of our us customers also increased
selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2000 versus fiscal 1999

     interest expense increased by 20 during fiscal 2000 to 450 million
this increase reflected incremental interest costs due to significantly higher
average debt balances than in fiscal 1999 much of this increase was offset by
the effect of lower interest rates outside of the us and the effect of our
restructured operating agreement with niac which reduced the interest rate on
product purchases financed by niac

                                        15
page   18

     other incomeexpense was a net expense of 232 million in fiscal 2000 as
compared to a net expense of 215 million in fiscal 1999 significant amounts
included in other incomeexpense were interest income profit sharing expense
goodwill amortization certain foreign exchange conversion gains and losses and
asset disposal gains and losses in fiscal 1999 other incomeexpense also
included a 150 million credit related to the change in accounting for
substantially all inventories in the us from the lastin firstout lifo
method to the firstin firstout fifo method the change was not sufficiently
material to require presentation of the cumulative effect or to restate
comparable income statements as dictated by accounting principles board opinion
no 20

     our effective tax rate was 370 in fiscal 2000 significantly lower than
the prior year rate of 395 in fiscal 1999 this decrease was primarily due to
reduced state taxes and the utilization of tax loss carryforwards in certain
recently profitable foreign operations where our effective rate is lower than
in the us

fiscal 1999 restructuring charge

     during fiscal 1999 the company incurred a 601 million restructuring
charge as a result of certain actions taken to better align our cost structure
with expected revenue growth rates as a result of the restructuring actions we
were able to remove approximately 36 million from our cost structure

     the charge shown below in tabular format was primarily for costs of
severing employees including severance packages lease abandonments and the
write down of assets no longer in use two major areas that were affected by the
reduction in force include our information technology functions primarily in
the us as we shifted to an outsource agreement for certain areas of our
operations and european customer service and accounting where we have been
consolidating functions from individual countries to our european headquarters
outside of these two areas employees were terminated from various other areas
around the company including our asia pacific region the original number of
employees to be terminated was 1291 as of may 31 2001 71 employees have
found positions elsewhere in the company and 1200 have left the company
leaving 20 still to be terminated

     the second major component of the 1999 charge was a writeoff of certain
equipment hardware and software development costs at one of our us
distribution centers due to a change in strategy around how we flow product for
a specific type of business

     due to the change in the number of employees that will be terminated 01
million and 14 million of the reserve was reversed during fiscal 2001 and
fiscal 2000 respectively the remaining accrual balance as of may 31 2001 of
15 million will be relieved as leases expire and severance payments are
completed

     detail of the restructuring charge is as follows

euro conversion

     on january 1 1999 eleven of the fifteen member countries of the european
union established permanent fixed conversion rates between their existing
currencies and the european unions new common currency the euro in january
2001 an additional country greece also established a fixed conversion rate to
the euro during the transition period ending december 31 2001 public and
private parties may pay for goods and services using either the euro or the
participating countrys legacy currency beginning january 1 2002 euro
denominated bills and coins will be issued and the legacy currencies will be
completely withdrawn from circulation on june 30 2002

     we have had a dedicated project team working on the euro transition
strategy since january 1998 we have made modifications to information
technology systems supporting marketing order management purchasing
invoicing payroll and cash management functions in order to make them euro
compliant all major systems have been converted and are euro compliant well
ahead of the end of the transitional period

     we believe the introduction of the euro may create a move towards a greater
level of wholesale price harmonization although differing country costs and
value added tax rates will continue to result in price differences at the retail
level over the past three years we have been actively working to assess and
where necessary adjust pricing practices to operate effectively in this new
environment

     the costs of adapting our systems and practices to the implementation of
the euro were generally related to the modification of existing systems and
totaled approximately 8 million these costs were expensed as incurred
primarily in fiscal 2000 we believe that the conversion to the euro will not
have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

recently issued accounting standards

     effective june 1 2001 we will adopt statement of financial accounting
standards sfas no 133 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities as amended by sfas no 138 accounting for certain derivative
instruments and certain hedging activities fas 133

     as required upon adoption of fas 133 a onetime transition adjustment will
be recorded as of june 1 2001 on both our consolidated statement of income and
consolidated balance sheet we estimate that the transition adjustment on the
consolidated statement of income to be a charge of approximately 51 million
net of tax effect this amount relates to an investment that will be adjusted to
fair value in accordance with fas 133 the transition adjustment on the
consolidated balance sheet represents the initial recognition of the fair values
of hedge derivatives outstanding on the adoption date and realized gains and
losses on effective hedges for which the underlying exposure has not yet
affected earnings the transition adjustment on the consolidated balance sheet
is estimated to be an increase in current assets of 1185 million an increase
in noncurrent assets of 870 million an increase in current liabilities of
1516 million and an increase in other comprehensive income of approximately
590 million net of tax effects

     in july 2001 the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 142
fas 142 goodwill and other intangible assets our adoption date is expected
to be june 1 2002 as required by fas 142 we will perform an impairment test
on goodwill and other intangible assets as of the adoption date thereafter we
will perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances
occur indicating that goodwill or other intangible assets might be impaired
amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets including those
recorded in past business combinations will cease we have not yet determined
what the impact of fas 142 will be on our results of operations and financial
position

liquidity and capital resources

     cash provided by operations was 6565 million in fiscal 2001 compared to
6996 million in fiscal 2000 our primary source of operating cash flow was net
income earned during the year of 5897 million the company also generated cash
flow by utilizing tax loss carryforwards which resulted in a decrease in
deferred income tax assets during the year and from income tax benefits from
stock option exercises these cash

                                        17
page   20

inflows were partially offset by a slight increase in operating working capital
which reflected a higher level of operating activity in the current fiscal year

     cash used by investing activities during fiscal 2001 was 3423 million
compared to 4400 million invested during fiscal 2000 the total for fiscal
2001 related primarily to capital expenditures for computer equipment and
software driven by our supply chain initiative investments in new retail
outlets the expansion of our world headquarters and the development of new
distribution facilities in japan during fiscal 2002 we will continue to incur
expenditures related to the supply chain initiative and retail expansion
although we currently expect total capital expenditures to be less than the
total for fiscal 2001

     cash used by financing activities in fiscal year 2001 was 3499 million
up from 2521 million in the prior year this amount included uses of cash for
dividends to shareholders a net reduction of shortterm debt payment of a
maturing note payable and share repurchases these uses of cash were partially
offset by proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options

     the share repurchases were part of a 10 billion share repurchase program
that began in fiscal 2001 after completion of a fouryear 10 billion program
in fiscal 2000 to date under the new program we have purchased a total of 40
million shares of nikes class b common stock for 1570 million we expect to
fund the current program largely from operating cash flow the timing and the
amount of shares purchased will be dictated by our capital needs and stock
market conditions

     we have filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange
commission sec under which 5000 million in debt securities are available to
be issued our longterm debt rating is a2 and a by moodys investor service and
standard and poors corporation respectively

     liquidity is also provided by our commercial paper program under which
there was 7100 million and 6919 million outstanding at may 31 2001 and may
31 2000 respectively our issuances of commercial paper are required to be
supported by committed lines of credit andor cash during fiscal 2001 we
entered into a new 125 billion committed credit facility with a group of
banks 750 million has a maturity of 364 days from the facility date and 500
million has a maturity of five years from the facility date to date we have
not borrowed under this facility each year the 750 million 364 day facility
can be extended 364 days and the 500 million five year facility can be
extended one year our ratings for the issuance of commercial paper are p1 and
a1 by moodys investor service and standard and poors corporation
respectively we also maintain significant uncommitted short and longterm lines
of credit with banks at may 31 2001 and 2000 we had letters of credit
outstanding totaling 8518 million and 6782 million respectively these
letters of credit were issued for the purchase of inventory

     management currently believes that cash generated by operations together
with access to external sources of funds will be sufficient to meet our
operating and capital needs

     dividends per share of common stock for fiscal 2001 were 048 the same as
in fiscal 2000 we have paid a dividend for every quarter since february 1984
consistent with our practice in prior years we will review our dividend policy
at the meeting of our board of directors in november however based upon
current projected earnings and cash flow requirements we anticipate continuing
to pay a quarterly dividend



item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk

     in the normal course of business and consistent with established policies
and procedures we employ a variety of financial instruments to manage exposure
to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates it is our
policy to utilize these financial instruments only where necessary to finance
our business and manage such exposures we do not enter into these transactions
for speculative purposes

     we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation as a result of our
international sales production and funding activities our foreign currency
risk management objective is to protect cash flows from the adverse impact of
exchange rate movements we use forward exchange contracts and purchased options
to hedge certain firm commitments and the related receivables and payables
including third party or intercompany transactions and use purchased currency
options to hedge certain anticipated but not yet firmly committed

                                        18
page   21

transactions when we begin hedging exposures depends on the nature of the
exposure and market conditions generally all firmly committed and anticipated
transactions that are hedged are to be recognized within twelve months in
addition we use crosscurrency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated
payments under intercompany loan agreements hedged transactions are principally
denominated in european currencies japanese yen australian dollars canadian
dollars and korean won

     our financial performance is also exposed to movements in short and
longterm market interest rates our objective in managing this interest rate
exposure is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flows and to reduce overall borrowing costs to achieve these objectives we
maintain a mix of medium and longterm fixed rate debt commercial paper bank
loans and trade financing from niac

market risk measurement

     we monitor foreign exchange risk interest rate risk and related
derivatives using a variety of techniques including a review of market value
sensitivity analysis and valueatrisk var our marketsensitive derivative
and other financial instruments as defined by the sec are foreign currency
forward contracts foreign currency option contracts crosscurrency swaps
intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed interest rate us
dollar denominated debt and fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debt

     we use var to monitor the foreign exchange risk of our foreign currency
forward and foreign currency option derivative instruments only the var
determines the maximum potential oneday loss in the fair value of these foreign
exchange ratesensitive financial instruments the var model estimates assume
normal market conditions and a 95 confidence level there are various modeling
techniques that can be used in the var computation our computations are based
on interrelationships between currencies and interest rates a
variancecovariance technique we determined these interrelationships by
observing foreign exchange currency market changes and interest rate changes
over the preceding one year the value of foreign currency options does not
change on a onetoone basis with changes in the underlying currency rate we
adjusted the potential loss in option value for the estimated sensitivity the
delta and gamma to changes in the underlying currency rate we have
excluded anticipated transactions firm commitments cash balances and accounts
receivable and payable denominated in foreign currencies from the var
calculation which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge

     the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent
actual losses in fair value that we will incur nor does it consider the
potential effect of favorable changes in market rates it also does not
represent the full extent of the possible loss that may occur actual future
gains and losses will differ from those estimated because of changes or
differences in market rates and interrelationships hedging instruments and
hedge percentages timing and other factors

     the estimated maximum oneday loss in fair value on nikes foreign currency
sensitive financial instruments derived using the var model was 189 million
and 95 million at may 31 2001 and may 31 2000 respectively such a
hypothetical loss in fair value of our derivatives would be offset by increases
in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged

     details of all other marketsensitive derivative and other financial
instruments including their fair values are included in the table below these
instruments include intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies fixed
interest rate japanese yen denominated debt fixed interest rate us dollar
denominated debt and crosscurrency swaps for debt obligations the table
presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by
expected maturity dates we have excluded the crosscurrency swaps from the
foreign exchange risk category because these instruments eliminate all foreign
currency exposure in the cash flows of a dutch guilder denominated intercompany
loan we have included these crosscurrency swaps in the interest rate risk
category but excluded the related intercompany loan from this category because
the intercompany interest eliminates in consolidation for the crosscurrency
swaps the table presents both the dutch guilder swap payable and us dollar
swap receivable and the respective pay and receive interest rates all
information is presented in us dollar equivalents in millions except
interest rates

the use of forward contracts and swaps with third parties

     the fixed interest rate japanese yen denominated debts were issued by and
are accounted for by two of nikes japanese subsidiaries accordingly the
monthly remeasurement of these instruments due to changes in foreign exchange
rates is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income upon the
consolidation of these subsidiaries

     there was not a significant change in debt or crosscurrency swap market
risks during fiscal 2001 the us dollar fair values of intercompany loans
denominated in foreign currencies was 6928 million at may 31 2000 which is
the same as the carrying values of the loans prior to their elimination the
us dollar fair value of the fixed rate japanese yen denominated debt that was
outstanding at may 31 2000 was 2204 million versus a carrying value of 2198
million at that date the us dollar fair values of the fixed rate us dollar
denominated debt the dutch guilder swap payable and the us dollar swap
receivable as of may 31 2000 were 2884 million 2266 million and 2888
