 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america canada south africa the philippines and effective january 4 2022 tanzania our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 974 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2021 in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2021 we owned 34177 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers in addition on january 4 2022 we closed on 1445 towers under our previously announced deal in tanzania our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business through organic growth and expansion of our tower portfolio to create shareholder value we believe that the longterm and repetitive nature of our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending which arises in our site development business key elements of our strategy include 

organic growth 

 maximizing our tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers’ structural capacity can generate additional lease revenue and be achieved at a low incremental cost we measure the available capacity of our existing sites to support additional tenants by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2021 we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure 

 capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries we believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will permit us to continue to organically grow our site leasing and site development services 

 systematic tower portfolio growth  we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our domestic and international tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures we believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity including cash from operating activities and borrowings is to acquire andor build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

 disciplined tower acquisitions in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers from third parties that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of several different investment return metrics review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

 international tower growth the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our tower growth in these markets is primarily driven by 1 wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks 2 increased consumer mobile data traffic such as media streaming mobile apps and games web browsing and email and 3 incremental spectrum auctions as well as incremental voice and data network deployments   

 international market expansion we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 

o country analysis – we consider the country’s economic and political stability and whether the country’s general business legal and regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business 

o market potential – we analyze the expected demand for wireless services and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur 

o risk adjusted return criteria – we consider whether buying or building towers in a country and providing our management and leasing services will meet our return criteria as part of this analysis we consider the risk of entering into an international market for example the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation real estate permitting and taxation risks and how our expansion meets our longterm strategic and financial objectives for the region and our business generally 

new build program we build new towers domestically and internationally in our new build program we construct tower structures 1 under buildtosuit arrangements or 2 in locations that are strategically chosen by us under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we seek to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to organically grow our site leasing business and to capture new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

controlling our underlying land positions  we believe that a primary component of a strong site leasing business is the ability to control the underlying land positions consequently we have acquired perpetual easements longterm leases or other property interests for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these perpetual easements longterm leases and other property interests will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in rents for property interests in the future as of december 31 2021 approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control was 37 years as of december 31 2021 approximately 107 of our tower structures had ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years 

exploring opportunities in evolving technologies and ancillary services in addition to our traditional towerrelated services we are currently exploring ancillary services and evolving technologies that we believe will allow us to create additional value by leveraging our current assets capabilities and relationships with wireless service providers and others by expanding sba’s business within the growing communications ecosystem this includes supporting efforts for edge data centers and private networks utilizing citizens broadband radio service “cbrs” technology for example we are exploring ways to participate in edge computing infrastructure to support existing and future customers’ increasing need to deploy computing capabilities to locations closer to their end users such as regional data centers and smaller local data centers located at the base of our towers sba owns two regional data centers and multiple towerbased data centers in support of this initiative with regard to private networks sba has partnered with different school districts in developing pilots to help close the digital divide through the deployment of private cbrs networks these network deployments are designed to leverage schoolowned assets and sba tower assets to extend the network to the students in their homes we are also exploring opportunities to leverage tower assets and infrastructure to provide energy as a service including through the deployment of onsite battery backup systems powered by solar energy 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless data traffic will require wireless service providers to continue to increase the capacity of their networks and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 

 consumers are increasing their demand for wireless connectivity due to the adoption of bandwidthintensive wireless data applications such as video gaming social networking and enhanced web browsing and the growth in machinetomachine applications according to a report published by ericsson in november 2021 global total mobile data traffic was estimated to reach around 65 exabytes per month by the end of 2021 and is projected to grow by a factor of around 44 to reach 288 exabytes per month in 2027 

 the velocity of spectrum development is expected to remain dynamic as carriers continue to deploy new bands and optimize bands that are currently in service both of which activities we expect will require carriers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites for example recent and future spectrum auctions such as the cband auction and auction 110 in the us are expected to contribute to growth in the upcoming years in addition the continued deployment of 5g wireless technologies is expected to increase equipment installation at existing sites 

 consumers list network quality as a key contributor when terminating or changing service to remain competitive and to decrease subscriber churn rates wireless carriers have made substantial capital investments into their wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage we expect wireless carriers to continue to expend capital to differentiate their product offerings 

we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us 

our businesses 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states south america central america canada south africa the philippines and effective january 4 2022 tanzania we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 974 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2021 we owned 17356 sites in the united states and its territories for the year ended december 31 2021 we generated 799 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites we derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from tmobile att and verizon wireless in the united states our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including renewal option periods our ground leases and other property interests in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually as of december 31 2021 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 

international site leasing 

we currently own and operate towers in 15 international markets throughout south america central america canada south africa the philippines and effective january 4 2022 tanzania our largest international market is brazil as of december 31 2021 we owned 16821 sites in our international markets of which approximately 30 of our total towers are located in brazil and no other international markets each country is considered a market represented more than 4 of our total towers in addition on january 4 2022 we closed on 1445 towers under our previously announced deal in tanzania our operations in our international 

markets are primarily in the site leasing business and we continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers and organic growth 

we derive international site leasing revenues from all the major carriers in each of the 15 countries in which we operate in our international markets our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant in canada and in our central american markets tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods in our south american markets south africa and the philippines tenant leases typically escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index in tanzania tenant leases typically escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators site leases in our south american markets typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying rent related to ground leases and other property interests in south africa our site leases contain pass through charges related to utilities and in tanzania our site leases include components related to utilities and fuel the utility and fuel portion of our tanzanian site leases adjust periodically in accordance with changes in diesel fuel and electricity prices in certain markets such as brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site 

in our international markets ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods which are at our option in our central american markets canada and the philippines ground leases and other property interests provide for fixed rent escalators which typically average 23 annually and in our south american markets and south africa ground leases adjust in accordance with an inflationary index 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases and other property interests tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in brazil canada chile south africa and the philippines significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina peru and tanzania our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices these market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

customers 

we lease tower space to and perform site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators internationally we lease tower space to all the major service providers in south america central america canada south africa the philippines and effective january 4 2022 tanzania 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 



1 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and sprint on april 1 2020 

in addition to the big 3 wireless carriers tmobile att and verizon wireless we have also provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned towers or managed properties enabling us to grow our site leasing business and 

 successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins andor provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business 

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents directors and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customer relationships our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 large independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 owners and operators of alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers 

international site leasing – internationally our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks large multinational national and regional independent tower companies and alternative facilities such as rooftop outdoor and indoor das networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the domestic and international site leasing business 

site development – the site development business is competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local region and market areas while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development companies zoning consultants real estate firms wireless construction companies tower owners telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

human capital 

our corporate offices are located in boca raton florida we also have employees located in our international regional and local offices we consider our employee relations to be good as of december 31 2021 we had 1596 employees of which 464 were based outside of the us and its territories 

diversity equity and inclusion we recognize and appreciate the impact that our employees have on the success of our company our customers and the communities we serve we pride ourselves in promoting an inclusive environment that celebrates and encourages all forms of diversity as of december 31 2021 women represented 42 of our global workforce and 40 of our us employees identified as a racial or ethnic minority 

we value all those who serve our country and are proud to support military veterans and their families as they transition out of the military sba has earned the distinction of being a military friendly employer and a veteran employer 

talent management we see diversity of thought and experience as critical factors to the longterm success of sba as such we are committed to building a pipeline of future business leaders through the strategic identification of diverse candidates to join our organization we invest in our employees’ professional growth and development by providing resources and opportunities to develop their skills and expand their expertise 

the wellbeing of our employees is a critical element of our culture employee engagement and productivity we offer a competitive total rewards package which includes marketbased pay performancebased annual incentive awards healthcare and retirement benefits holiday and paid time off and tuition assistance 

health and safety  at sba providing a safe and healthy work environment for the protection of our employees is paramount the safety of our tower climbers has been a key focus of the company since it started in 1989 in 2013 we opened our internal facility tower u which provides a rigorous multiday safety certification program that is required for all our employed tower climbers we are proud of the fact that our average lostday incident rate in the us days away from work due to workplace incidents for 2021 was below the 2020 bureau of labor benchmark our tower u safety professionals offer tower rescue training to first responders because we recognize that the safety of these first responders is paramount to the communities in which we operate 

we temporarily transitioned to telecommuting in early 2020 and put in place various programs and safety protocols to support our team members and their families as they navigated the covid19 pandemic in partnership with a local leading hospital in south florida we held regular informational sessions during which our global team members could ask questions to management and health professionals we also proudly supported our local communities’ covid19 response and relief efforts in preparation for a safe return to work we invested in upgrades to our offices to improve air quality and allow for greater social distancing 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 799 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations antennas operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and 

location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered with the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and fcc spectrum licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with legal requirements applicable to tower owners or operators relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 and the fcc’s rules implementing that act require the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites on federal property for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years 

environmental regulation as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies our screening for environmental impacts includes evaluation of those of our tower site locations 1 that might be located in a wilderness area or a wildlife preserve 2 that might affect threatened and endangered species or their habitat esa 3 that might affect properties included in or eligible for inclusion in the national register of historic places nrhp or indian religious and cultural sites 4 that might affect world heritage areas and iucn category iiv protected areas 5 that will be located in a floodplain and where facility equipment will not be placed at least one foot above the base flood elevation of the floodplain 6 whose construction will involve significant changes in surface features eg in wetlands water diversions considerable ground disturbance deforestation 7 that might affect migratory birds if the towers are over 450 feet 8 that involve highintensity lighting in a residential area or would cause rf radiation over fccestablished limits and 9 that would involve similar considerations under the laws or best practices of our international markets when a tower site is impacted by any of the listed categories we promptly complete an environmental assessment and obtain approval from the appropriate regulatory agency which may include steps to mitigate the impact of construction or operation of the site our regional site managers typically inspect our tower sites annually and report on the presence of new bird nests this ensures we minimize our impact and remain environmentally compliant during the operational life of our assets 

we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real 

estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers fcc rules establish presumptively reasonable time periods for state and local authorities to act on applications to collocate a facility or deploy a facility such as a tower in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria however in august 2018 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling stating that express and de facto moratoria on deployment of telecommunications facilities violate the communications act this fcc ruling has been affirmed by a federal appellate court 

international regulations  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results ability to service our indebtedness and stock price could be adversely affected 

our wireless service providers have and may continue to be subject to consolidation pressures significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers has resulted and is expected to continue to result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space as a result of overlapping coverage or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar historically tmobile att and verizon have grown through acquisitions of other wireless service providers as a result the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks or networks have been discontinued during 2020 the consolidation of tmobile and sprint was completed and we began to experience nonrenewal “churn” of certain leases as a result of this merger we currently expect that this churn will represent an aggregate of between 1400 million and 1900 million of cash site leasing revenue over the next six years the aggregate churn estimate includes both overlapping and adjacent sprint leases we do not expect the annual churn to be uniform over this period as the timing of the churn will depend on termination rights as well as the needs of the carrier 

consolidation of wireless service providers has also occurred in some of our international markets and could continue to occur for example in january 2019 claro acquired telefonica’s assets in guatemala in july 2020 liberty latin america acquired telefonica’s assets in costa rica and in september 2021 cable  wireless announced its plan to acquire claro’s assets in panama three markets in which we own and operate towers furthermore telefonica has announced it may reduce its operations in its latin american markets other than brazil in brazil as a result of oi sa’s “oi” recent restructuring the court has approved the sale of all of oi’s wireless tower assets to the three other telecommunications providers in brazil telefonica claro and tim the sale received regulatory and antitrust authorizations and we have received a preliminary listing of which assets will be assigned to each 

carrier approximately 1568 of our 7525 tower leases that we had with oi as of december 31 2021 overlap with leases from the other three telecommunications providers and therefore may be subject to nonrenewal upon expiration of the leases as of december 31 2021 our leases with oi have an average remaining current term of approximately 124 years 

if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum these consolidations could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness these risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

we derive revenue through numerous site leasing and site development contracts in the united states and our international markets each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five years to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant however if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected in addition many of our tenants in our international markets are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities which may impact their creditworthiness 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

while the us wireless service provider market has recently reduced to three nationwide wireless service providers att tmobile and verizon we and most of the industry anticipate that the number of nationwide wireless service providers will increase to four again once dish successfully builds out its nationwide network if dish is unable to successfully buildout its wireless network or is unable to successfully compete for customers once its network is built out then our dependence on the three us wireless service providers for our financial and operational growth will be exacerbated 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 



1 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and sprint on april 1 2020 

we also have customer concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 





1 amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and sprint on april 1 2020 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2021 and 2020 



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future which may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including share repurchases tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures or to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement the interest rate that we pay on indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility and the term loans varies based on a fixed margin over either a base rate or a eurodollar rate which references the libor rate as of december 31 2021 this indebtedness represented approximately 27 billion or 215 of our total indebtedness as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk interest rates including libor fluctuate periodically and as such may increase in future periods if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease due to inflationary pressures on the us economy it appears likely that interest rates will increase during 2022 and may continue to increase which may decrease our net income in addition the increasing interest rates may result in higher interest expense on our current fixed rate indebtedness upon a refinancing 

although we have used interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate risk from time to time we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk furthermore the increase in our use of derivative instruments increases our exposure to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty to the instrument fails to meet or perform the terms of the instrument as of december 31 2021 we had interest rate swaps on a portion of our 2018 term loan that fixed 195 billion in notional value for approximately 425 years receiving interest at onemonth libor plus 175 basis points and paying a fixed rate of 1874 

the discontinuation of libor could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

libor has been the subject of recent proposals for reform the iba ceased the publication of usd libor for the 1 week and 2 month tenors on december 31 2021 and intends to cease all other tenors on june 30 2023 these reforms will cause the establishment of an alternative reference rates the us federal reserve of new york’s arrc working group is proposing to replace us dollar libor with secured overnight financing rate sofr which is calculated based on repurchase agreements with the federal reserve which are fully secured by us treasury securities this alternative rate if adopted would be used to calculate our interest rates andor payments on our variable rate indebtedness under our credit agreement which matures beyond 2021 any new interest rate may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form as such the potential effect of any such event is uncertain but were it to occur our cost of capital financial results cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected at the current time it is uncertain which of the various alternative reference rates will attain industrywide market acceptance as a replacement for libor 

our interest rate expense may materially increase as a result of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate while we have amended our revolving credit facility to provide mechanics relating to a transition away from libor as a benchmark interest rate and the replacement of libor by an alternative benchmark rate it is unclear the extent to which the alternative benchmark rates will be as predictable as libor or if such rates will be more expensive or more volatile than libor unfortunately there are various sofr rates and none have gained widespread industry acceptance consequently post termination of libor our variable rate indebtedness may be at interest rates that are higher than the interest rates that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form 

furthermore as a result of the termination of libor the interest rate on our interest rate swaps may not exactly conform to whatever new fallback interest rate is utilized under our credit agreement moreover if an entirely different interest rate is utilized for our credit agreement than the fallback rate on the interest rate swap we may need to unwind our swap agreement and enter into a new swap agreement which would result in us incurring breakage costs on our existing swap agreement which we would need to pay to the swap agreement provider and those costs may be significant if the fallback libor rate under our interest rate swaps differs from the fallback libor rate under our credit agreement but we keep our swap agreement outstanding our interest rate swaps would be at least partially ineffective as a hedge and could require us to marktomarket the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap through our income statement although fasb has stated that it is expected to grant temporary relief at the outset of the termination of libor from markingtomarket the ineffective portion of swap agreements should a portion of the swap agreement become ineffective due to the fallback to a rate that is different than the libor fallback rate under the swap agreements however if this temporary relief should end while our swap agreement and credit agreement were still outstanding it may have an adverse impact on our income statement 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures or result in nonrenewals that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our wireless service provider customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates or lead to nonrenewals of existing leases furthermore pricing pressures could lead to more prevalent network sharing both domestically and internationally which could reduce the demand for our tower space or lead to nonrenewals of existing leases in addition the increasing number of towers 1 may provide customers the ability to relocate their antennas to other towers if they determine that a more suitable efficient or economical location exists which could lead to nonrenewal of existing leases or 2 may adversely impact our ability to enter into new customer leases this impact may be exacerbated if competitors construct towers near our existing towers any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our growth rate and our future operations 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies who may be substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do 

• international tower companies who have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

the site development segment of our industry is also competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios some of our competitors and financial sponsors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do finally laws regulating competition domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm through acquisitions 

our ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated domestically and internationally and the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as planned in 2022 if we are not able to increase our new build tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in developing markets and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the site 

leasing revenues generated by our international operations were approximately 201 during the year ended december 31 2021 and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation 

• laws affecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws new or significantly increased municipal fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively and could materially affect the profitability of our operations 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture 

• governmental regulations and restrictions impacting tower licenses spectrum licenses and concessions including additional restrictions on the use or revocation of such licenses concessions or spectrum and additional conditions to receive or maintain such licenses 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters and employee compensation and benefits matters 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• challenges arising from lessdeveloped infrastructure in certain markets 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel and 

• our ability to provide power to our sites in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites 

we are also exposed to risks operating in countries with high levels of inflation including the risk that inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators and the risk that adverse economic conditions may discourage growth in consumer demand and consequently reduce our customers’ demand for our site leasing services as of december 31 2021 approximately 20 of our tenant leases in our international markets include fixed escalators 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in us dollars in brazil canada chile south africa and the philippines significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina peru and tanzania our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2021 approximately 201 of our total site leasing revenue was generated by our international operations of which 151 was generated in nonus dollar currencies including 114 which was denominated in brazilian reais the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility and weakened 53 when comparing the average rate for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 this trend has affected and may in the future continue to affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

furthermore we have intercompany loan agreements with our foreign subsidiaries to borrow in us dollars as of december 31 2021 and 2020 the aggregate amount outstanding under the intercompany loan agreements subject to remeasurement with our foreign subsidiaries was 8729 million and 9098 million respectively in accordance with asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future consequently if the us dollar strengthens against the brazilian real or the south african rand our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we recorded a 443 million loss and a 1456 million loss net of taxes respectively on 

the remeasurement of intercompany loans due to changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2021 we repaid 1499 million under our intercompany loan with our brazilian subsidiary 

a slowdown in demand for wireless services could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

we expect a significant portion of our future revenue growth will result from investments in the deployment of new or fallow spectrum by our wireless service provider customers including the buildout by dish of a fourth nationwide network in the us wireless service providers typically invest in their networks in response to consumer demand for additional or higher quality service if consumers significantly reduce their use of wireless services or fail to widely adopt and use new wireless technologies and their products and applications our wireless service provider customers could experience a reduction in the rate of growth of or a decrease in demand for their services and therefore reduce the amount they invest in their network 

delays in the rollout of new spectrum or deployment of new technologies could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

our ability to grow is dependent on the ability and willingness of our wireless service provider customers to invest in the rollout of new spectrum or new technologies much of the future capital investment by domestic wireless service providers is expected to result from the rollout of 5g however the rollout of prior spectrum including 3g and 4g was often delayed and the rollout of this spectrum may encounter similar interruptions for example in january 2022 several major us wireless carriers had to temporarily delay deployment of new wireless facilities that were meant to facilitate the evolution of their wireless networks to 5g technology in response to concerns of the aviation industry that those 5g facilities could interfere with equipment used for aviation and could impede aviation safety although the fcc faa the wireless telecommunications industry and the aviation industry are working on solutions to alleviate those concerns the timing for resolution is unclear and such uncertainty could further impact the amount of and timing for network investment by our customers 

the fcc continues to auction new bands of spectrum including cband and auction 110 our customers have been and are expected to be the primary winners of these auctions and subsequently deploy this spectrum on our portfolio which would provide us with a revenue growth opportunity any delays or failure of these auctions could negatively impact future demand for our towers similarly any delays in the clearing or availability of this spectrum subsequent to these auctions could delay the related demand for our towers 

if our wireless service provider customers are unable to access sufficient capital to invest in their infrastructure or spectrum it could reduce our ability to meet our growth expectations 

each wireless service provider must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to deploy new spectrum in their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum for example dish wireless has stated that it expects capital expenditures for its 5g network deployment to total approximately 100 billion if some or all of our wireless service provider customers are unable to access sufficient capital or unwilling based on the economic cost of such capital to invest in the expansion of their networks it could adversely affect our revenue growth 

new technologies or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks or changes in a wireless service provider customers business model may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure also as customers deploy increased capital to develop and implement new technologies they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our wireless service provider customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain sites because portions of the customers networks may become redundant in addition other technologies and architectures such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site communications architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business the majority of our tower portfolio comprises traditional macro sites and therefore is not as diversified into nonmacro sites and other technologies and architectures as some of our competitors in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure for example our wireless service provider customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements resulting in reduced capital spending or a decision to sell or not renew their spectrum licenses or concessions any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures or changes in a customers business model may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a 

material adverse effect any such event may have a disproportionate impact on our business compared to our competitors whose portfolios may be more technologically and architecturally diversified than ours  in addition while we are exploring and investing in ancillary services and emerging technologies including our mobile edge computing initiative and private networks those investments may not prove to be profitable 

these factors could also have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to the land under our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their property interests to third parties including property interest aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all we currently have 35year nonterminable leases with oi one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers with respect to 2113 towers that we acquired in 2013 the land underneath these towers is currently subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government will have the right to 1 renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or 2 terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land at the time we acquired the towers we also entered into a right of first refusal to purchase such land to the extent that the brazilian regulations permit those assets to be sold brazil has recently adopted a new telecommunications law that is expected to provide oi andor the brazilian government rights to sell the land underlying these assets however as the regulations implementing this new law have not yet been promulgated the amount if at all that we would be required to pay to purchase such interests is undetermined if the concession is not renewed and we are unable to purchase the land then our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease in 2048 for the year ended december 31 2021 we generated 63 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers 

as of december 31 2021 the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control was approximately 37 years and approximately 107 of our tower structures have ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as a result of those acquisition activities these activities may fail to achieve the benefits we expected from the acquisition or the acquired assets may not meet our internal guidelines for current and future returns particularly if we are required to place greater reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers in individually material acquisitions the impact of these risks is further enhanced in acquisitions of towers in international markets where it may be more challenging to analyze and verify all relevant information with respect to the assets being acquired these risks could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as 1 an adverse financial impact if the acquired towers do not achieve the projected financial results 2 the impact of unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions on our results of operations 3 increased demands on our cash resources that may impact our ability to explore other opportunities 4 undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover 5 an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships 6 additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks and 7 diversion of managerial attention 

as part of new acquisitions of tower assets in natural disasterprone areas we may assess asset exposure to physical risks and inspect assets for signs of climaterelated damage to help us understand the degree of exposure to tornadoes fires hurricanes floods and earthquakes the site may face over the longer term however our environmental due diligence may not uncover all natural disasterrelated risks to tower assets that we acquire and our mitigation measures may not be successful which could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have an adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations is also subject to a number of risks and financial impacts including unforeseen operating difficulties large expenditures diversion of management attention the loss of key customers andor 

personnel our inability to retain or timely find suitable replacements for key employees and management needed to operate the acquired business and exposure to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in acquisitions of a material number of towers there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating domestic and international acquisitions into our existing business 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 2020 senior notes and the 2021 senior notes the senior credit agreement and the agreement for the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each instrument limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

additionally the agreement governing the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter and 2 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases and dividend payments we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel although we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer these agreements do not ensure that those members will continue with us in their current capacity for any particular period of time we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if any of our key personnel were to leave or retire we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses or otherwise regulates wireless communications equipment wireless radio stations and radio and television broadcast stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify or add new equipment to existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation further as a result of our recent acquisition of a building containing a data center we also acquired a limited number of residential apartment units and became subject to additional federal state and local laws and regulations such as building zoning landlordtenant health and safety and accessibility governing residential housing 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television broadcast stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us in our international operations the impact of these zoning permitting and related regulations and restrictive covenants on our new builds colocations and operations could be exacerbated as some of these markets may lack established permitting processes for towers have inconsistencies between national and local regulations and have other barriers to timely construction and permitting of towers as a result tower construction in some of our international markets may be delayed or halted or our acquired towers may not perform as anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

as part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack data theft and exploiting potentially vulnerable services such as virtual private networks and collaboration platforms as a result of increased remote working caused by covid19 errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our or our vendors’ computer systems and backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results in addition security incidents that impact our customers and other business partners could adversely affect our business and operating results furthermore our investments in ancillary services and emerging technologies including data centers and our mobile edge computing initiative may leave us more vulnerable to 

security incidents create new exposure for us to different types of security incidents or exacerbate the impact of such incidents on our business and operating results 

data privacy and protection laws are evolving globally and present risks related to our handling of sensitive data that could result in regulatory penalties or litigation 

a portion of the activities that support our business involve collection storage and transfer of sensitive data of our employees tenants ground lessors and other third parties including residential tenants as a result of our recent data center acquisition that included a limited number of residential apartment units in recent years there has been increased public attention regarding the protection of personal data and security of data transfers accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection and information security the evolving nature of privacy laws in the us and the other countries where we have operations could impact our compliance costs in handling such data many data privacy regulations also grant private rights of action including brazils general data protection law and certain state laws such as californias consumer privacy act as interpretation and enforcement of these and other future data privacy regulations and industry standards evolve we may incur costs related to litigation or regulatory penalties if we are alleged to be noncompliant 

damage from natural disasters and other unforeseen events could adversely affect us 

our towers are subject to physical climaterelated risks associated with natural disasters including as a result of any potential effects of climate change such as tornadoes fires hurricanes floods and earthquakes or may collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies in addition we have energy sources on some of our tower sites and any unforeseen incident may cause damage to surrounding property we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers and damage to surrounding property but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits deductibles and retentions we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits deductibles and retentions to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower an incident involving our towers or tower sites for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers or surrounding property could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and may harm our reputation 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we may be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including expenses for ground leases and other property interests if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including climaterelated including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines penalties or taxes if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols generated prior to the 2018 tax year can be carried forward and used for up to 20 years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire nols generated starting in the 2018 tax year can be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to the 80 utilization limitation we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations if our tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax 

attributes are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties or make additional distributions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 “code” we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us and other foreign governments impose requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications technologies such as 5g could slow the growth of wireless companies and deployment of new technologies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the ongoing covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

despite recent progress in the administration of vaccines the continued covid19 pandemic and recent variants including delta and omicron and the related responsive containment and mitigation measures that have been put in place across the world such as the imposition of travel restrictions quarantines adoption of remote working and impact on business and government services could adversely impact our business and operations and those of our customers in addition the pandemic continues to significantly impact worldwide economic conditions including negatively impacting economic growth and creating disruption and volatility in the global financial and capital markets among other things the pandemic and the responsive measures that have been adopted may adversely affect 

 the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us 

 demand for our wireless infrastructure including as a result of decreases in consumer spending 

 our ability to build new towers or the ability of our customers to install new antennas on an existing tower including as a result of delays or suspensions in the issuance of permits or other authorizations needed to increase the number of our tenants or amend our tenant leases 

 the availability and cost of skilled employees and contractors 

 the ability of our customers to procure telecommunications equipment through their supply chains 

 interest rates and the overall availability and cost of capital which could affect our ability to continue to grow our asset portfolio or pursue new business initiatives 

 the financial condition of wireless service providers including their ability to maintain liquidity 

 the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures 

 the ability of our tenants to make lease payments on a timely basis and 

 the willingness of our tenants to renew their existing leases for additional terms 

inflationary pressures whether caused by the covid19 pandemic or otherwise may further exacerbate these risks in addition our results of operations may be negatively affected by foreign currency adjustments resulting from the covid19 pandemic including the recent strengthening of the us dollar against the currencies in certain international markets in which we operate the extent of the impact of covid19 on our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments such as the duration of the pandemic new information on the severity of covid19 or its variants and methods taken to contain or treat the outbreak of covid19 including the vaccine distribution program all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted additionally if the covid19 pandemic results in a global recession the negative impacts of the pandemic on our operating results may worsen or be prolonged 

risks related to our status as a reit 

complying with the reit requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders for example to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate assets 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify and be subject to tax as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing nols to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code these distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities furthermore our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements these actions could have the effect of reducing our income amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced 

we may be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 

sales or offerings to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage decrease our adjusted funds from operations or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases 

thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore compliance with the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required reit distributions 

the senior credit agreement the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders under the senior credit agreement our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our reit distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100 of our reit taxable income so long as sba senior finance ii’s ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda does not exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter in addition under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions a failure to comply with the debt service coverage ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us finally while the indentures governing the 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a reit or to avoid entity level taxation this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2020 senior notes or 2021 senior notes as applicable have not otherwise been accelerated 

if these limitations prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limitations do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax and potentially the nondeductible 4 excise tax on the retained amounts 

our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

reits are required to distribute annually at least 90 of their reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain as of december 31 2021 6547 million of our federal nols are attributes of the reit we may use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized which may adversely affect the market value of our class a common stock the code places limitations upon the future availability of nols based upon changes in our equity if these occur our ability to offset future income with existing nols may be limited 

the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by our board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by our board of directors and will depend on among other factors our nols our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds consequently our future distribution levels may fluctuate 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which would reduce our cash flows and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a trs if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our trs assets and operations also will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located if we continue our international expansion we may have additional trs assets and operations subject to such taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to represent more than 20 25 for taxable years beginning prior to december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit if we continue our international expansion we may have increased net income from trss which may cause us to rise above these thresholds 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification 

our board’s ability to revoke our reit qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our shareholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders if any in computing our taxable income and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 and may not be able to continue to operate successfully as a reit in addition we are required to maintain substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a reit we have also incurred additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to operating as a reit and our management and other personnel have devoted additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the code these factors may adversely affect our performance as a reit if our performance is adversely affected it could affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock reit ordinary income distributions are generally eligible for a 20 deduction to the extent distributed out of the reit’s taxable income 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent our shareholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 

in order for us to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification no more than 50 in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by 5 or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax as a reit has been made in addition our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made our articles of incorporation contain reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our 

outstanding shares of class a common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits these ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests

 item 2 properties 

we own our headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently have approximately 160000 square feet of office space we also own or have entered into longterm leases for international and regional locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities and in certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of december 31 2021 approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control is 37 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods for a total of 30 years or more 

most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas we measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located as of december 31 2021 we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america canada south africa the philippines and effective january 4 2022 tanzania our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 974 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2021 in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2021 we owned 34177 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers in addition on january 4 2022 we closed on 1445 towers under our previously announced deal in tanzania our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states south america central america canada south africa the philippines and effective january 4 2022 tanzania as of december 31 2021 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 in addition as of december 31 2021 approximately 30 of our total towers are located in brazil and no other international markets each country is considered a market represented more than 4 of our total towers we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants including tmobile att verizon wireless oi sa telefonica claro tigo tim and dish wireless wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site 

in the united states and our international markets our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant in canada and in our central american markets tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods in our south american markets south africa and the philippines tenant leases typically escalate annually in accordance with an inflationary index in tanzania tenant leases typically escalate using a combination of fixed and inflation adjusted escalators site leases in our south american markets typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying rent related to ground leases and other property interests in south africa our site leases contain pass through charges related to utilities and in tanzania our site leases include components related to utilities and fuel the utility and fuel portion of our tanzanian site leases adjust periodically in accordance with changes in diesel fuel and electricity prices in certain markets such as brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• cash and noncash rental expense on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance 

• fuel in those international markets that do not have an available electric grid at our tower sites and 

• lease initial direct cost amortization 

in the united states and our international markets ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods which are at our option in our central american markets canada and the philippines ground leases and other property interests provide for fixed rent escalators which typically average 23 annually and in our south american markets and south africa ground leases adjust in accordance with an inflationary index as of december 31 2021 approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases and other property interests tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in brazil canada chile south africa and the 

philippines significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina peru and tanzania our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 



we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements 

during 2022 we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2021 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology 

during 2020 the consolidation of tmobile and sprint was completed and we began to experience nonrenewal of certain leases as a result of this merger we currently expect that this churn will represent an aggregate of between 1400 million and 1900 million of cash site leasing revenue over the next six years the aggregate churn estimate includes both overlapping and adjacent sprint leases 

site development 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

capital allocation strategy 

our capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends while the addition of a cash dividend to our capital allocation strategy in 2019 has provided us with a new tool to return value to our shareholders we will also continue to make investments focused on increasing adjusted 

funds from operations per share to achieve this we expect to continue to deploy capital to portfolio growth and stock repurchases subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements available funds and market conditions while maintaining our target leverage levels key elements of our capital allocation strategy include 

portfolio growth we intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio domestically and internationally primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria 

stock repurchase program we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value we believe that share repurchases when purchased at the right price will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share 

dividend cash dividends are an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders we do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and believe that due to our low dividend payout ratio we can continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock while the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our board of directors we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future 

covid19 update 

we have experienced minimal impact to our business or results of operations from the coronavirus covid19 pandemic the extent to which covid19 could adversely affect our future business operations will depend on future developments such as the duration of the outbreak new information on the severity of covid19 or its variants and methods taken to contain or treat the outbreak of covid19 including a vaccine distribution program while the full impact of covid19 is not yet known we will continue to monitor these developments and the potential effects on our business 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2021 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant

site leasing revenues 

revenue from site leasing is recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five years to 10 years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets revenue from site leasing represents 91 of our total revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 

site development revenues 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved which are determined based on costs incurred amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized over time determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best 

available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion refer to note 5 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

the site development segment represents approximately 9 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 we account for site development revenue in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements furthermore these contracts do not typically include variable consideration therefore the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract 

accounts receivable 

the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was 1020 million and 741 million respectively of which 246 and 143 million related to the site development segment respectively we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers in addition we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable refer to note 15 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment 

lease accounting 

we adopted asu no 201602 leases “topic 842” using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date of january 1 2019 this standard requires all lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments the adoption of the new lease standard had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets but did not have a significant impact on our lease classification or a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and liquidity additionally the adoption of topic 842 did not have a material impact on our debt covenant compliance under our current agreements we have elected to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component for all underlying classes of assets 

in order to calculate our lease liability we make certain assumptions related to lease term and discount rate in making the determination of the period for which we are reasonably certain to remain on the site we will assume optional renewals are reasonably certain of being exercised for the greater of 1 a period sufficient to cover all tenants under their current committed term where we have provided rights to the tower not to exceed the contractual ground lease terms including renewals and 2 a period sufficient to recover the investment of significant leasehold improvements located on the site for the discount rate we use the rate implicit in the lease when available to discount lease payments to present value however our ground leases and other property interests generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate therefore we estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on the lease term and lease currency we use publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates refer to note 2 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion on lease accounting 

reference rate reform 

asu 202004 and asu 202101 reference rate reform provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met the amendments apply only to contracts hedging relationships and other transactions that reference libor or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform the expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments do not apply to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after december 31 2022 except for hedging relationships existing as of december 31 2022 that an entity has elected certain optional expedients for and that are retained through the end of the hedging relationship an entity may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through december 31 2022 the ice benchmark administration limited “iba” ceased the publication of usd libor for the 1 week and 2 month tenors on december 31 2021 and will cease all other tenors on june 30 2023 on july 7 2021 we amended our credit facility to provide mechanics relating to a transition away from libor as a benchmark interest rate and the replacement of libor by an alternative benchmark rate refer to “debt instruments and debt service requirements” below for further discussion of the credit facility as of december 31 2021 we have not modified any other contracts as a result of reference rate reform and are evaluating the impact this standard may have on our consolidated financial statements 

results of operations 

this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans

asset impairment and decommission costs 



asset impairment and decommission costs decreased 71 million on an actual and constant currency basis for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year these changes were primarily as a result of a decrease in impairment charges resulting from our regular analysis of whether the future cash flows from certain towers are adequate to recover the carrying 

value of the investment in those towers as well as a decrease in costs related to sites decommissioned in the year ended december 31 2021 compared to the prior year period 

depreciation accretion and amortization expenses 



depreciation accretion and amortization expense decreased 218 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis depreciation accretion and amortization expense decreased 174 million these changes were primarily due to the impact of assets that became fully depreciated since the prior year period partially offset by an increase in the number of towers we acquired and built since january 1 2020

other income expense 



interest expense decreased 150 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year this change was primarily due to a lower weighted average interest rate due in part to the interest rate swap entered into during third quarter of 2020 partially offset by a higher average principal amount of cash interest bearing debt outstanding

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses asset impairment and decommission costs interest income interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization and income taxes 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits in addition adjusted ebitda is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 



1 total interest expense includes interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees 

2 provision benefit for taxes includes 907 and 901 of franchise taxes for the year ended 2021 and 2020 respectively reflected in selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 

adjusted ebitda increased 1137 million for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda increased 1187 million these changes were primarily due to an increase in segment operating profit partially offset by an increase in cash selling general and administrative expenses

inflation 

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in south america south africa the philippines and tanzania which have inflationary index based rent escalators

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america canada and south africa our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 984 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2020 in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2020 we owned 32923 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business through organic growth and expansion of our tower portfolio to create shareholder value we believe that the longterm and repetitive nature of our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending which arises in our site development business key elements of our strategy include 

organic growth 

 maximizing our tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers’ structural capacity can generate additional lease revenue and be achieved at a low incremental cost we measure the available capacity of our existing sites to support additional tenants by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2020 we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure 

 capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries we believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will permit us to continue to organically grow our site leasing and site development services 

 systematic tower portfolio growth  we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our domestic and international tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures we believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity including cash from operating activities and borrowings is to acquire andor build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

 disciplined tower acquisitions – in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers from third parties that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of several different investment return metrics review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

 international tower growth – the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our tower growth in these markets is primarily driven by 1 wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks 2 increased consumer mobile data traffic such as media streaming mobile apps and games web browsing and email and 3 incremental spectrum auctions as well as incremental voice and data network deployments

 international market expansion – we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 

o country analysis – we consider the country’s economic and political stability and whether the country’s general business legal and regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business 

o market potential – we analyze the expected demand for wireless services and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur 

o risk adjusted return criteria – we consider whether buying or building towers in a country and providing our management and leasing services will meet our return criteria as part of this analysis we consider the risk of entering into an international market for example the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation real estate permitting and taxation risks and how our expansion meets our longterm strategic objectives for the region and our business generally 

new build program – we build new towers domestically and internationally in our new build program we construct tower structures 1 under buildtosuit arrangements or 2 in locations that are strategically chosen by us under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we seek to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to organically grow our site leasing business and to capture new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

controlling our underlying land positions  we believe that a primary component of a strong site leasing business is the ability to control the underlying land positions consequently we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements longterm leases or other property interests for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in rents for property interests in the future as of december 31 2020 approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control was 35 years as of december 31 2020 approximately 106 of our tower structures had ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years 

exploring opportunities in evolving technologies and ancillary services in addition to our traditional towerrelated services we are currently exploring ancillary services and evolving technologies that we believe will allow us to create additional value by leveraging our current assets and relationships with wireless service providers and expand sbas business within the growing communications ecosystem this includes supporting efforts for edge computing and private networks utilizing citizens broadband radio service “cbrs” technology for example we are exploring ways to participate in mobile edge computing infrastructure to support existing and future customers’ increasing need to spread computing capabilities to more locations such as regional data centers and smaller local data centers at our towers sba has invested in two regional data centers and one towerbased data center in support of this initiative with regard to private networks sba has recently partnered with the city of indianapolis to launch an elearning network pilot for marion county schools to help close the digital divide through the deployment of a private cbrs network the network deployment is designed to leverage marion country school assets and sba tower assets to extend the network to the students in their homes 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless data traffic will require wireless service providers to continue to increase the capacity of their networks and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to install equipment at new sites and 

add new equipment at existing sites we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 

 consumers are increasing their demand for wireless connectivity due to the adoption of bandwidthintensive wireless data applications such as video social networking and enhanced web browsing and the growth in machinetomachine applications such as connected cars according to a report published by ericsson in november 2020 global total mobile data traffic is estimated to reach around 51 exabytes per month by the end of 2020 and is projected to grow by a factor of around 45 to reach 226eb per month in 2026 

 the velocity of spectrum development is expected to remain dynamic as carriers continue to deploy new bands and optimize bands that are currently in service both of which activities we expect will require carriers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites for example recent and future spectrum auctions such as the cbrs and cband auctions and a new network for first responders that was developed by att for the first responder network authority an independent authority within the us department of commerce are expected to contribute to growth in the upcoming years in addition the continued deployment of 5g wireless technologies is expected to increase equipment installation at existing sites 

 consumers list network quality as a key contributor when terminating or changing service to remain competitive and to decrease subscriber churn rates wireless carriers have made substantial capital investments into their wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage we expect wireless carriers to continue to expend capital to differentiate their product offerings 

we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us 

our businesses 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states south america central america canada and south africa we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 977 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2020 we owned 16546 sites in the united states and its territories for the year ended december 31 2020 we generated 797 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites we derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from tmobile att and verizon wireless in the united states our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including renewal option periods our ground leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually as of december 31 2020 no us state or territory had more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count or more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 

international site leasing 

we currently own and operate towers in 13 international markets throughout south america central america canada and south africa our largest international market is brazil as of december 31 2020 we owned 16377 sites in our international markets of which 30 of our global sites are located in brazil and less than 4 of our global sites are located in each of our other international markets each country is considered a market our operations in our international markets are solely in the site leasing business and we continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers and organic growth 

we derive international site leasing revenues primarily from oi sa telefonica claro and tim in canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant 

leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in south africa and our central and south american markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with multiple renewal periods in central america we have similar fixed rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america and south africa escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying rent related to ground leases and other property interests in certain international markets such as brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site 

in our international markets ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple renewal periods which are at our option in central america and canada ground leases and other property interests provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in south american and south african markets adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases and other property interests tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are primarily limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in brazil canada chile and south africa significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices these market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

customers 

we lease tower space to and perform site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators internationally we lease tower space to all the major service providers in south america central america canada and south africa 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 



1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and sprint on april 1 2020 

in addition to the big 3 wireless carriers tmobile att and verizon wireless we have also provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned towers or managed properties enabling us to grow our site leasing business and 

 successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins andor provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business 

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents directors and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customer relationships our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 large independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 owners and operators of alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers 

international site leasing – internationally our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks large multinational national and regional independent tower companies and alternative facilities such as rooftop outdoor and indoor das networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the domestic and international site leasing business 

site development – the site development business is competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local region and market areas while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development companies zoning consultants real estate firms wireless construction companies tower owners telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

human capital 

our corporate offices are located in boca raton florida we also have employees located in our international regional and local offices we consider our employee relations to be good as of december 31 2020 we had 1483 employees of which 421 were based outside of the us and its territories of this total our employees work in the following departments 364 in site leasing operations 387 in site development 652 in corporate support 57 in sales and marketing and 23 in safety 

we seek to foster an inclusive work environment and we respect the diversity our employees bring to the organization through their unique ideas opinions and contributions we believe it is essential to recognize and value these differences which is one 

of the many reasons sba holds quarterly town hall meetings and other informal meetings with executives elicits employee feedback and conducts annual performance evaluations in line with our commitment to diversity 231 of our us new hires in 2020 were women and 344 were ethnic minorities 

the wellbeing of our employees is a crucial element of our culture employee engagement and productivity we offer a competitive total rewards package which includes marketbased pay performancebased annual incentive awards healthcare and retirement benefits family leave holiday and paid time off and tuition assistance we also invest in our employees’ professional growth and development by providing resources and opportunities to develop their skills and expand their expertise 

we value all those who serve our country and are proud to support military veterans and their families as they transition out of the military sba has earned the distinction of being a military friendly employer and a veteran employer we are proud to have veterans on our team  their integrity work ethic ability to adapt and strong teamwork skills blend well with the sba core values in 2020 over 7 of our employees were veterans and we have collaborated with hiring our heroes directemployers and recruitmilitary to actively hire veterans 

at sba providing a safe and healthy work environment for the protection of our employees is paramount the safety of our tower climbers has been a key focus of the company since it started in 1989 in 2013 we opened our internal facility tower u which provides a rigorous multiday safety certification program that is required for all our employed tower climbers we are proud of the fact that our average lostday incident rate in the us days away from work due to workplace incidents for 2020 was below the 2019 bureau of labor benchmark our tower u safety professionals offer tower rescue training to first responders because we recognize that the safety of these first responders is paramount to the communities in which we operate 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 797 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an 

environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers fcc rules establish presumptively reasonable time periods for state and local authorities to act on applications to collocate a facility or deploy a facility such as a tower in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria however in august 2018 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling stating that express and de facto moratoria on deployment of telecommunications facilities violate the communications act this fcc ruling has been affirmed by a federal appellate court 

international regulations  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results ability to service our indebtedness and stock price could be adversely affected 

our wireless service providers have and may continue to be subject to consolidation pressures significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers have resulted and are expected to continue to result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space as a result of overlapping coverage or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar tmobile sprint att and verizon have grown through acquisitions of other wireless service providers as a result the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks and in the case of sprint the nextel iden network was discontinued during 2020 the consolidation of tmobile and sprint was completed reducing the number of national wireless service providers in the us to three during the second half of 2020 we began to experience nonrenewal of certain leases as a result of the tmobilesprint merger and we expect to continue to experience churn arising from this merger in the upcoming years for the year ended december 31 2020 leases with tmobile and sprint as they existed prior to the merger represented approximately 176 and 147 of our total site leasing revenue respectively the revenue generated from legacy sprint leases where both legacy tmobile and legacy sprint overlap on sites where both companies leased space represented 59 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2020 excluding and incremental to the impact from previously disclosed expected consolidation churn from tmobile’s metropcs and sprint’s clearwire networks in addition these overlapping sites have an average remaining current term of approximately 37 years and 50 years with sprint and tmobile respectively as they existed premerger 

consolidation of wireless service providers has also occurred in some of our international markets and could continue to occur for example in january 2019 claro acquired telefonica’s assets in guatemala and in july 2020 liberty latin american acquired telefonica’s assets in costa rica three markets in which we own and operate towers furthermore telefonica has announced its intent to sell its operations in its other latin american markets other than brazil in brazil as a result of oi sa’s recent restructuring the court has approved the sale of all of oi’s wireless tower assets to the three other telecommunications providers in brazil telefonica claro and tim the sale is subject to regulatory and antitrust authorizations and the designation of which assets will be assigned to which carrier has not yet been publicized however we expect that a portion of our 7492 tower leases that we had with oi as of december 31 2020 will be subject to overlap and may be subject to nonrenewal upon expiration of the leases as of december 31 2020 our leases with oi have an average remaining current term of approximately 134 years 

if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum these consolidations could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness these risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

we derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts in the united states and canada each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant tenant leases in south africa and our central and south american markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with multiple renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected for example in january 2018 oi sa “oi” our largest customer in brazil emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan and is expected to resolve all of its prepetition obligations by 2022 during 2020 as part of its recent restructuring the court has approved the sale of all of oi’s wireless tower assets to the three other telecommunications providers in brazil telefonica claro and tim the 

sale is subject to regulatory and antitrust authorizations and the designation of which assets will be assigned to which carrier has not yet been publicized  in addition many of our tenants in our international markets are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities which may impact their creditworthiness 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 



1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and sprint 

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 





1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and sprint 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2020 and 2019 



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future which may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including share repurchases tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures or to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates or changes in central bank monetary policy may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur pursuant to our revolving credit facility and term loan and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense arising on our existing and future floating rate indebtedness or upon refinancing of our fixed rate debt pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement the interest rate that we pay on indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility or term loans varies based on a fixed margin over either a base rate or a eurodollar rate which references the libor rate as of december 31 2020 this indebtedness represented approximately 27 billion or 243 of our total indebtedness as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk interest rates including libor fluctuate periodically and as such may increase in future periods if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease in addition libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform and the uk financial conduct authority announced its desire to phase out the use of libor by june of 2023 this may cause libor to disappear entirely or perform differently than in the past if libor ceases to exist the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates andor payments on our variable rate indebtedness under our credit agreement which matures beyond 2021 in the future may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form as such the potential effect of any such event is uncertain but were it to occur our cost of capital financial results cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected it is unknown whether any alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements of libor 

although we have used interest rate swaps to mitigate this risk from time to time we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk furthermore the increase in our use of derivative instruments increases our exposure to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty to the instrument fails to meet or perform the terms of the instrument as of december 31 2020 we had interest rate swaps on a portion of our 2018 term loan that fixed 195 billion in notional value for approximately 425 years receiving interest at onemonth libor plus 175 basis points and paying a fixed rate of 1874 

the discontinuation of libor could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

libor has been the subject of recent proposals for reform and in july 2017 the uk financial conduct authority announced its desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 these reforms may cause libor to perform differently than it has in the past and libor may ultimately cease to exist after june 2023 these reforms will cause libor to cease to exist and will cause the establishment of an alternative reference rates the us federal reserve in conjunction with the alternative reference rates committee is proposing to replace us dollar libor with a newly created index which is calculated based on repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities these alternative rates if adopted would be used to calculate our interest rates andor 

payments on our variable rate indebtedness under our credit agreement which matures beyond 2021 any new reference rate may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form as such the potential effect of any such event is uncertain but were it to occur our cost of capital financial results cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected it is unknown whether any alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements of libor 

i f libor ceases to exist after 2021 the interest rate on our interest rate swaps may not exactly conform to the new interest rate under our credit agreement if the fallback libor rate to our interest rate swaps differs from the fallback libor rate under our credit agreement our interest rate swaps could be at least partially ineffective as a hedge and could require us to marktomarket the ineffective portion of the interest rate swap through our income statement 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures or result in nonrenewals that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our wireless service provider customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates or lead to nonrenewals of existing leases furthermore pricing pressures could lead to more prevalent network sharing both domestically and internationally which could reduce the demand for our tower space or lead to nonrenewals of existing leases in addition the increasing number of towers 1 may provide customers the ability to relocate their antennas to other towers if they determine that a more suitable efficient or economical location exists which could lead to nonrenewal of existing leases or 2 may adversely impact our ability to enter into new customer leases this impact may be exacerbated if competitors construct towers near our existing towers any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our growth rate and our future operations 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies who may be substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do 

• international tower companies who have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

the site development segment of our industry is also competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available in the us and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers for example in 2020 we passed on more us acquisitions than we did in 2019 due to asset quality price or lease terms furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do finally laws regulating competition domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm through acquisitions 

our ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed 

by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated domestically and internationally and the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as planned in 2021 if we are not able to increase our new build tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in developing markets and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were approximately 190 during the year ended december 31 2020 and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation 

• laws affecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws new or significantly increased municipal fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively and could materially affect the profitability of our operations 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture 

• governmental regulations and restrictions impacting tower licenses spectrum licenses and concessions including additional restrictions on the use or revocation of such licenses concessions or spectrum and additional conditions to receive or maintain such licenses 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters and employee compensation and benefits matters 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• challenges arising from lessdeveloped infrastructure in certain markets and 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel 

we are also exposed to risks operating in countries with high levels of inflation including the risk that inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators and the risk that adverse economic conditions may discourage growth in consumer demand and consequently reduce our customers’ demand for our site leasing services for example we have a subsidiary in argentina through which we operate our site leasing business the argentinean economy was deemed to be “highly inflationary” from a us gaap perspective as of the second quarter of 2018 and remains highly inflationary as of december 31 2020 as a result we remeasured the financial statements for those operations to the us dollar as of july 1 2018 although this change did not have a material impact on our financial statements as our assets in and revenue from argentina were each less than 1 of consolidated assets and revenue respectively as of december 31 2020 going forward fluctuations in the argentinean peso to us dollar exchange rate could negatively impact our financial results 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in us dollars in brazil canada chile and south africa significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 204 of our total cash site leasing revenue was generated by our international operations of which 145 was generated in nonus dollar currencies including 114 which was denominated in brazilian reais the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility and weakened 228 when comparing the average rate for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 this trend has affected and may in the future continue to affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

furthermore we have intercompany loan agreements with our foreign subsidiaries to borrow in us dollars as of december 31 2020 and 2019 the aggregate amount outstanding under the intercompany loan agreements subject to remeasurement with our foreign subsidiaries was 9098 million and 8997 million respectively in accordance with asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future consequently if the us dollar strengthens against the brazilian real or the south african rand our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 we recorded a 1456 million loss and a 90 million gain net of taxes respectively on the remeasurement of intercompany loans due to changes in foreign exchange rates for the year ended december 31 2020 we repaid 258 million under our intercompany loan with our brazilian subsidiary 

delays in the rollout of new spectrum due to a slowdown in demand for wireless services the inability or unwillingness of wireless service providers to invest in their infrastructure or delays in the availability of new spectrum could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

we expect a significant portion of our future revenue growth will result from investments in the deployment of new or fallow spectrum by our wireless service provider customers wireless service providers typically invest in their networks in response to consumer demand for additional or higher quality service if consumers significantly reduce their use of wireless services or fail to widely adopt and use new wireless technologies and their products and applications our wireless service provider customers could experience a reduction in the rate of growth of or a decrease in demand for their services and therefore reduce the amount they invest in their network 

regardless of consumer demand each wireless service provider must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to deploy new spectrum in their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum if some or all of our wireless service providers are unwilling or unable to significantly invest in their networks it could adversely affect our revenue growth however if any of these wireless service provider customers or other wireless service providers are unable to access sufficient capital to develop their spectrum then overall demand for our towers and services could be adversely affected 

the fcc continues to auction new bands of spectrum including cbrs and cband our customers have been and are expected to be the primary winners of these auctions and subsequently deploy this spectrum on our portfolio which would provide us with a revenue growth opportunity any delays or failure of these auctions could negatively impact future demand for our towers similarly any delays in the clearing or availability of this spectrum subsequent to these auctions could delay the related demand for our towers 

new technologies or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks or changes in a wireless service provider customers business model may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure also as customers deploy increased capital to develop and implement new technologies they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our wireless service provider customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain sites because portions of the customers networks may become redundant in addition other technologies and architectures such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site communications architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business the majority of our tower portfolio comprises traditional macro sites and therefore is not as diversified into nonmacro sites and other technologies and architectures as some of our competitors in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless 

equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure for example our wireless service provider customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements resulting in reduced capital spending or a decision to sell or not renew their spectrum licenses or concessions any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures or changes in a customers business model may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect any such event may have a disproportionate impact on our business compared to our competitors whose portfolios may be more technologically and architecturally diversified than ours in addition while we are exploring and investing in ancillary services and emerging technologies including our mobile edge computing initiative and private networks those investments may not prove to be profitable which could divert managements attention from other valueenhancing opportunities 

these factors could also have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to the land under our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their property interests to third parties including property interest aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all we currently have 35year nonterminable leases with oi one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers with respect to 2113 towers that we acquired in 2013 the land underneath these towers is currently subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government will have the right to 1 renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or 2 terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land at the time we acquired the towers we also entered into a right of first refusal to purchase such land to the extent that the brazilian regulations permit those assets to be sold brazil has recently adopted a new telecommunications law that is expected to provide oi andor the brazilian government rights to sell the land underlying these assets however as the regulations implementing this new law have not yet been promulgated the amount if at all that we would be required to pay to purchase such interests is undetermined if the concession is not renewed and we are unable to purchase the land then our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease for the year ended december 31 2020 we generated 69 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers 

as of december 31 2020 the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control was approximately 35 years and approximately 106 of our tower structures have ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as a result of those acquisition activities these activities may fail to achieve the benefits we expected from the acquisition or the acquired assets may not meet our internal guidelines for current and future returns particularly if we are required to place greater reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers in individually material acquisitions the impact of these risks is further enhanced in acquisitions of towers in international markets where it may be more challenging to analyze and verify all relevant information with respect to the assets being acquired these risks could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as 1 an adverse financial impact if the acquired towers do not achieve the projected financial results 2 the impact of unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions on our results of operations 3 increased demands on our cash resources that may impact our ability to explore other opportunities 4 undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover 5 an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships 6 additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks and 7 diversion of managerial attention 

the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations is also subject to a number of risks and financial impacts including unforeseen operating difficulties large expenditures diversion of management attention the loss of key customers andor personnel our inability to retain or timely find suitable replacements for key employees and management needed to operate the acquired business and exposure to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in acquisitions of a material number of 

towers there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating domestic and international acquisitions into our existing business 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 2016 senior notes the 2020 senior notes the 2021 senior notes the senior credit agreement and the agreement for the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each instrument limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter and 2 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 2016 senior notes 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases and dividend payments we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel although we have employment agreements with 

jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer these agreements do not ensure that those members will continue with us in their current capacity for any particular period of time we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if any of our key personnel were to leave or retire we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment wireless radio stations and radio and television broadcast stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation further as a result of our recent acquisition of a building containing a data center we also acquired a limited number of residential apartment units and became subject to additional federal state and local laws and regulations such as building zoning landlordtenant health and safety and accessibility governing residential housing 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television broadcast stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us in our international operations the impact of these zoning permitting and related regulations and restrictive covenants on our new builds colocations and operations could be exacerbated as some of these markets may lack established permitting processes for towers have inconsistencies between national and local regulations and have other barriers to timely construction and permitting of towers as a result tower construction in some of our international markets may be delayed or halted or our acquired towers may not perform as anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

as part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our or our vendors’ computer systems and backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results in addition security incidents that impact our customers and other business partners could adversely affect our business and operating results furthermore our investments in ancillary services and emerging technologies including data centers and our mobile edge computing initiative may leave us more vulnerable to security incidents create new exposure for us to different types of security incidents or exacerbate the impact of such incidents on our business and operating results 

data privacy and protection laws are evolving globally and present risks related to our handling of sensitive data that could result in regulatory penalties or litigation 

a portion of the activities that support our business involve collection storage and transfer of sensitive data of our employees tenants ground lessors and other third parties including residential tenants as a result of our recent data center acquisition that included a limited number of residential apartment units in recent years there has been increased public attention regarding the protection of personal data and security of data transfers accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection and information security the evolving nature of privacy laws in the us brazil and other countries where we have operations could impact our compliance costs in handling such data many data privacy regulations also grant private rights of action including brazils new general data protection law and certain state laws such as californias consumer privacy act as interpretation and enforcement of these and other future data privacy regulations and industry standards evolve we may incur costs related to litigation or regulatory penalties if we are noncompliant 

damage from natural disasters and other unforeseen events could adversely affect us 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes fires hurricanes and earthquakes or may collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies in addition we have energy sources on some of our tower sites and any unforeseen incident may cause damage to surrounding property we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers and damage to surrounding property but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower an incident involving our towers or tower sites for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers or surrounding property could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and may harm our reputation 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we may be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including expenses for ground leases and other property interests if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols generated prior to the 2018 tax year can be carried forward and used for up to 20 years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire nols generated starting in the 2018 tax year can be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to the 80 utilization limitation we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations if our tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties or make additional distributions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 “code” we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us and other foreign governments impose requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the recent covid19 pandemic has significantly impacted worldwide economic conditions and could have a material adverse effect on our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial condition 

in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus covid19 was identified in china this virus continues to spread globally and in march 2020 the world health organization declared covid19 a pandemic in december 2020 the first covid19 vaccine was released to the us public for distribution public and private sector responsive measures such as the imposition of travel restrictions quarantines adoption of remote working and suspension of nonessential business and government services could impact our operations in addition covid19 continues to significantly impact worldwide economic conditions including negatively impacting economic growth and creating disruption and volatility in the global financial and capital markets among other things covid19 and the responsive measures that have been adopted may adversely affect 

 the ability of our suppliers and vendors to provide products and services to us 

 demand for our wireless infrastructure 

 our ability to build new towers or the ability of our customers to install new antennas on an existing tower including as a result of delays or suspensions in the issuance of permits or other authorizations needed to increase the number of our tenants or amend our tenant leases 

 interest rates and the overall availability and cost of capital which could affect our ability to continue to grow our asset portfolio or pursue new business initiatives 

 the financial condition of wireless service providers 

 the ability and willingness of wireless service providers to maintain or increase capital expenditures 

 the ability of our tenants to make lease payments on a timely basis and 

 the willingness of our tenants to renew their existing leases for additional terms 

in addition our results of operations may be negatively affected by foreign currency adjustments resulting from the covid19 pandemic including the recent strengthening of the us dollar against the currencies in certain international markets in which we operate the extent of the impact of covid19 on our business operations results of operations cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related government restrictions all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted additionally if the covid19 pandemic results in a global recession the negative impacts of the pandemic on our operating results may worsen or be prolonged 

risks related to our status as a reit 

complying with the reit requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders for example to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate assets 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify and be subject to tax as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing nols to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code these distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities furthermore our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements these actions could have the effect of reducing our income amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we would be subject to us federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced 

we may be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings 

sales or offerings to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage decrease our adjusted funds from operations or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases 

thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore compliance with the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required reit distributions 

the senior credit agreement the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2016 senior notes 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders under the senior credit agreement our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our reit distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100 of our reit taxable income so long as sba senior finance ii’s ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda does not exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter in addition under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions or securitization a failure to comply with the debt service coverage ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us finally while the indentures governing the 2016 senior notes 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a reit or to avoid entity level taxation this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2016 senior notes 2020 senior notes or 2021 senior notes as applicable have not otherwise been accelerated 

if these limitations prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limitations do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax and potentially the nondeductible 4 excise tax on the retained amounts 

our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

reits are required to distribute annually at least 90 of their reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain as of december 31 2020 6511 million of our federal nols are attributes of the reit we may use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized which may adversely affect the market value of our class a common stock the code places limitations upon the future availability of nols based upon changes in our equity if these occur our ability to offset future income with existing nols may be limited 

the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by our board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by our board of directors and will depend on among other factors our nols our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds consequently our future distribution levels may fluctuate 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which would reduce our cash flows and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a trs if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our trs assets and operations also will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located if we continue our international expansion we 

may have additional trs assets and operations subject to such taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to represent more than 20 25 for taxable years beginning prior to december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit if we continue our international expansion we may have increased net income from trss which may cause us to rise above these thresholds 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification 

our board’s ability to revoke our reit qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our shareholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders if any in computing our taxable income and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 and may not be able to continue to operate successfully as a reit in addition we are required to maintain substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a reit we have also incurred additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to operating as a reit and our management and other personnel have devoted additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the code these factors may adversely affect our performance as a reit if our performance is adversely affected it could affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock reit ordinary income distributions are generally eligible for a 20 deduction to the extent distributed out of the reit’s taxable income 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent our shareholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 

in order for us to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification no more than 50 in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by 5 or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax 

as a reit has been made in addition our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made our articles of incorporation contain reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits these ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests

 item 2 properties 

we own our headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently have approximately 160000 square feet of office space we also own or have entered into longterm leases for international and regional locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities and in certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of december 31 2020 approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control is 35 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal periods for a total of 30 years or more 

most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas we measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located as of december 31 2020 we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america canada and south africa our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 984 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2020 in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2020 we owned 32923 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states south america central america canada and south africa as of december 31 2020 1 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and 2 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2020 in addition as of december 31 2020 approximately 30 of our total towers are located in brazil and less than 4 of our total towers are located in any of our other international markets each country is considered a market we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants including tmobile att verizon wireless oi sa telefonica claro tigo and tim wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in south africa and our central and south american markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with multiple renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america and south africa escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying rent related to ground leases and other property interests 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• cash and noncash rental expense on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• lease initial direct cost amortization 

in the united states and our international markets ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in our south american markets and south africa adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2020 approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases and other property interests tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in brazil canada chile and south africa significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 



we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements during 2021 we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2020 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology 

site development 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

capital allocation strategy 

our capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends while the addition of a cash dividend to our capital allocation strategy in 2019 has provided us with a new tool to return value to our shareholders we will also continue to make investments focused on increasing adjusted funds from operations per share to achieve this we expect to continue to deploy capital to portfolio growth and stock repurchases subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements available funds and market conditions while maintaining our target leverage levels key elements of our capital allocation strategy include 

portfolio growth we intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio domestically and internationally primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria 

stock repurchase program we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value we believe that share repurchases when purchased at the right price will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share 

dividend in 2019 we added dividends as an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders we do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and we believe it will allow us to continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock while the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our board of directors we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future 

covid19 update 

during the year ended december 31 2020 we experienced minimal impact to our business or results of operations from the coronavirus covid19 pandemic the extent to which covid19 could adversely affect our future business operations will depend on future developments such as the duration of the outbreak new information on the severity of covid19 and methods taken to contain or treat the outbreak of covid19 while the full impact of covid19 is not yet known we will continue to monitor this recent outbreak and the potential effects on our business for more information regarding covid19 refer to item 1a risk factors 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2020 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five years to 10 years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets revenue from site leasing represents 94 of our total revenue for the year ended 2020 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved which are determined based on costs incurred amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized over time determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion refer to note 5 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

the site development segment represents approximately 6 of our total revenues we account for site development revenue in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers which was adopted on january 1 2018 by applying the modified retrospective transition method payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements furthermore these contracts do not typically include variable consideration therefore the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard had no impact on our financial results the adoption of the new standard had no impact to net income on an ongoing basis 

the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31 2020 and 2019 was 741 million and 1321 million respectively of which 143 and 407 million related to the site development segment respectively we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers in addition we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as 

determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable refer to note 15 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment 

lease accounting 

we adopted asu no 201602 leases “topic 842” using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date of january 1 2019 this standard requires all lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments the adoption of the new lease standard had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets but did not have a significant impact on our lease classification or a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and liquidity additionally the adoption of topic 842 did not have a material impact on our debt covenant compliance under our current agreements we have elected to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component for all underlying classes of assets 

in order to calculate our lease liability we make certain assumptions related to lease term and discount rate in making the determination of the period for which we are reasonably certain to remain on the site we will assume optional renewals are reasonably certain of being exercised for the greater of 1 a period sufficient to cover all tenants under their current committed term where we have provided rights to the tower not to exceed the contractual ground lease terms including renewals and 2 a period sufficient to recover the investment of significant leasehold improvements located on the site for the discount rate we use the rate implicit in the lease when available to discount lease payments to present value however our ground leases and other property interests generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate therefore we estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on the lease term and lease currency we use publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating our incremental borrowing rates refer to note 2 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion on lease accounting 

results of operations 

this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of realized and unrealized gains and losses on our intercompany loans 

year ended 2020 compared to year ended 2019 

revenues and segment operating profit 



revenues 

domestic site leasing revenues increased 712 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to 1 revenues from 283 towers acquired and 38 towers built since january 1 2019 and 2 organic site leasing growth  primarily from monetary lease amendments for additional equipment added to our towers as well as new leases and contractual rent escalators partially offset by lease nonrenewals 

international site leasing revenues increased 224 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis international site leasing revenues increased 937 million these changes were primarily due to 1 revenues from 2393 towers acquired and 694 towers built since january 1 2019 and 2 organic site leasing growth from new leases amendments and contractual escalators site leasing revenue in brazil represented 114 of total site leasing revenue for the period no other individual international market represented more than 4 of our total site leasing revenue

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses asset impairment and decommission costs interest income interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization and income taxes 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits in addition adjusted ebitda is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2016 senior notes 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 



1 total interest expense includes interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees 

2 benefit provision for taxes includes 901 and 943 of franchise taxes for the year ended 2020 and 2019 respectively reflected in selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 

adjusted ebitda increased 820 million for the year ended december 31 2020 as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda increased 1273 million these changes were primarily due to an increase in site leasing segment operating profit partially offset by a decrease in site development segment operating profit and an increase in cash selling general and administrative expenses

our current primary market risk exposure is 1 interest rate risk relating to our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates if at all and 2 interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on the variable portion of our 2018 term loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our revolving credit facility which are at floating rates we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt including interest rate swaps on august 4 2020 we through our wholly owned subsidiary sba senior finance ii entered into an interest rate swap for 195 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month libor plus 175 basis points for a fixed rate of 1874 per annum through the maturity date of the 2018 term loan while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis in addition there is currently uncertainty about whether libor will continue to exist after 2021 the discontinuation of libor after 2021 and the replacement with an alternative reference rate may adversely impact interest rates and our interest expense could increase 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in brazil canada chile peru argentina colombia south africa and to a lesser extent our markets in central america in each of these countries we pay most of our selling general and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency in addition in brazil canada chile and south africa we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency in colombia argentina and peru we receive our revenue and pay our operating expenses in a mix of local currency and us dollars all transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2020 approximately 137 of our revenues and approximately 175 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the brazilian real from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2020 as of december 31 2020 the analysis indicated that such an adverse 

movement would have caused our revenues and operating income to decline by approximately 10 and 05 respectively for the year ended december 31 2020 

as of december 31 2020 we had intercompany debt which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income a change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at december 31 2020 would have resulted in approximately 766 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2020

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america canada and south africa our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 977 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2019 in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2019 we owned 32403 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business through organic growth and expansion of our tower portfolio to create shareholder value we believe that the longterm and repetitive nature of our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending which arises in our site development business key elements of our strategy include 

organic growth 

 maximizing our tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers’ structural capacity can generate additional lease revenue and be achieved at a low incremental cost we measure the available capacity of our existing sites to support additional tenants by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2019 we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure 

 capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries we believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will permit us to continue to organically grow our site leasing and site development services 

systematic tower portfolio growth  we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our domestic and international tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures we believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity including cash from operating activities and borrowings is to acquire andor build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

 disciplined tower acquisitions – in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers from third parties that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of several different investment return metrics review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

 international tower growth – the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our tower growth in these markets is primarily driven by 1 wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks 2 increased consumer mobile data traffic such as media streaming mobile apps and games web browsing and email and 3 incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments 

 international market expansion – we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 

o country analysis – we consider the country’s economic and political stability and whether the country’s general business legal and regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business 

o market potential – we analyze the expected demand for wireless services and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur 

o risk adjusted return criteria – we consider whether buying or building towers in a country and providing our management and leasing services will meet our return criteria as part of this analysis we consider the risk of entering into an international market for example the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and inflation real estate permitting and taxation risks and how our expansion meets our longterm strategic objectives for the region and our business generally 

new build program – we build new towers domestically and internationally in our new build program we construct tower structures 1 under buildtosuit arrangements or 2 in locations that are strategically chosen by us under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we seek to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to organically grow our site leasing business and to capture new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

controlling our underlying land positions  we believe that a primary component of a strong site leasing business is the ability to control the underlying land positions consequently we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements longterm leases or other property interests for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in rents for property interests in the future as of december 31 2019 approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control was 35 years as of december 31 2019 approximately 86 of our tower structures had ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years 

exploring opportunities in evolving technologies and ancillary services in addition to our traditional towerrelated services we are currently exploring ancillary services and evolving technologies that we believe will allow us to create value by leveraging our current assets and relationships with wireless service providers for example we are exploring opportunities to participate in mobile edge computing opportunities and in connection have recently invested in a data center 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless data traffic will require wireless service providers to continue to increase the capacity of their networks and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 

 consumers are increasing their demand for wireless connectivity due to the adoption of bandwidthintensive wireless data applications such as video social networking and enhanced web browsing and the growth in machinetomachine applications such as connected cars global mobile data traffic is forecast to reach 160 exabytes per month by 2025 an increase of 321 over the end of 2019 

 the velocity of spectrum development is expected to remain dynamic as carriers continue to deploy new bands and optimize bands that are currently in service both of which activities we expect will require carriers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites for example recent and future spectrum auctions such as the future cbrs and cband auctions and a new network for first responders that is being developed by att for the first responder network authority “firstnet” an independent authority within the department of commerce are expected to contribute to growth in the upcoming years in addition the deployment of 5g wireless technologies is expected to increase equipment installation at existing sites 

 consumers list network quality as a key contributor when terminating or changing service to remain competitive and to decrease subscriber churn rates wireless carriers have made substantial capital investments into their wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage we expect wireless carriers to continue to expend capital to differentiate their product offerings for example if the proposed sprinttmobile merger is consummated to meet future consumer demand the new combined sprinttmobile is expected to need to invest in its network by deploying its 25ghz spectrum holdings and dish network is expected to need to expend significant funds to develop a new nationwide network 

we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us 

our businesses 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states south america central america canada and south africa we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 977 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2019 we owned 16401 sites in the united states and its territories for the year ended december 31 2019 we generated 805 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites we derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless in the united states our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including renewal option periods our ground leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple five year renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually as of december 31 2019 1 no us state or territory included more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and 2 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 

international site leasing 

we currently operate in 13 international markets throughout south america central america canada and south africa our largest international market is brazil as of december 31 2019 we owned 16002 sites in our international markets of which 305 of our global sites are located in brazil and less than 3 of our global sites are located in each of our other international markets each country is considered a market our operations in our international markets are solely in the site leasing business and we continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers and organic growth 

we derive international site leasing revenues primarily from oi sa telefonica claro and tim in canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in south africa and our central and south american markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods in central america we have similar fixed rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america and south africa escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index in certain international markets such as brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and 

conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site tenant leases in south america typically provide a passthrough charge for the underlying rent for property interests in addition to the base tenant rent 

in our international markets ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple renewal periods which are at our option in central america and canada ground leases and other property interests provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in south american markets and south africa adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases and other property interests tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are primarily limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in brazil canada chile and south africa significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices these market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

customers 

we lease tower space to and perform site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators internationally we lease tower space to all the major service providers in south america central america canada and south africa 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 



in addition to the big 4 wireless carriers att tmobile sprint and verizon wireless we have also provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned towers or managed properties enabling us to grow our site leasing business and 

 successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins andor provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business 

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents directors and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customer relationships our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 large independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 owners and operators of alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers 

international site leasing – internationally our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks large multinational national and regional independent tower companies and alternative facilities such as rooftop outdoor and indoor das networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the domestic and international site leasing business 

site development – the site development business is competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local region and market areas while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development companies zoning consultants real estate firms wireless construction companies tower owners telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our corporate offices are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida we also have employees located in our international regional and local offices as of december 31 2019 we had 1475 employees of which 435 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 805 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction 

for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers fcc rules establish presumptively reasonable time periods for state and local authorities to act on 

applications to collocate a facility or deploy a facility such as a tower in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria however in august 2018 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling stating that express and de facto moratoria on deployment of telecommunications facilities violate the communications act although this fcc ruling is currently the subject of petitions for reconsideration before the fcc and petitions for review before a federal appellate court it remains in effect 

international regulations  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2019 we had 643 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 218 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2018 we had 820 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 157 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed under executed contracts as of december 31 2019 we had approximately 548 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 761 million as of december 31 2018

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results ability to service our indebtedness and stock price could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar or acquired technologies may be discontinued att verizon and sprint have grown through acquisitions of other wireless service providers as a result the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks and in the case of sprint the nextel iden network was discontinued these consolidations have led and may continue to lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases in april 2018 tmobile and sprint entered into a definitive agreement to merge subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions both the fcc and the department of justice have approved the merger and it is currently expected to close during 2020 if this potential transaction closes it may lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases as a result of the rationalization of duplicative or overlapping parts of their networks for the year ended december 31 2019 tmobile and sprint represented approximately 172 and 152 of our total site leasing revenue respectively the revenue generated from sprint where both tmobile and sprint overlap on sites where both companies leased space represented 60 of our total site leasing 

revenue for the year ended december 31 2019 excluding and incremental to the impact from previously disclosed expected consolidation churn from tmobile’s metropcs and sprint’s clearwire networks in addition these overlapping sites have an average remaining current term of approximately 44 years and 46 years with sprint and tmobile respectively 

if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us these consolidations could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness these risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation in addition our customers may decide not to renew certain tower leases on towers that do not have duplicative or overlapping antennas which could further impact our operating results 

consolidation may also occur among wireless service provider customers in our international markets for example in january 2019 claro acquired telefonica’s assets in guatemala and el salvador two markets in which we own towers consolidations in our international markets may also lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases which could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition the market price of our class a common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of the announcement or consummation of wireless service provider customer consolidations and their impact on our future operating results 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 



we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 



‎ 



we derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts in the united states and canada each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods at the option of the tenant tenant leases in south africa and our central and south american markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected for example in january 2018 oi sa “oi” our largest customer in brazil emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan and is expected to resolve all of its prepetition obligations however if oi is unable to successfully fulfill its reorganization obligations or cannot operate its business on a goforward basis it could adversely affect our future results of operations in addition many of our tenants in our international markets are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities which may impact their creditworthiness 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2019 and 2018 



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future which may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including share repurchases tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures or to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates or changes in central bank monetary policy may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur pursuant to our revolving credit facility and term loan and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense arising on our existing and future floating rate indebtedness or upon refinancing of our fixed rate debt pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement the interest rate that we pay on indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility or term loans varies based on a fixed margin over either a base rate or a eurodollar rate which references the libor rate as of december 31 2019 this indebtedness represented approximately 29 billion or 274 of our total indebtedness as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk interest rates including libor fluctuate periodically and as such may increase in future periods if interest rates increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease in addition libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform and the uk financial conduct authority announced its desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 this may cause libor to disappear entirely or perform differently than in the past if libor ceases to exist the method and rate used to calculate our interest rates andor payments on our variable rate indebtedness under our credit agreement which matures beyond 2021 in the future may result in interest rates andor payments that are higher than lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the interest rates andor payments that would have been applicable to our obligations if libor was available in its current form as such the potential effect of any such event is uncertain but were it to occur our cost of capital financial results cash flows and results of operations may be adversely affected it is unknown whether any alternative reference rates will attain market acceptance as replacements of libor 

furthermore in an environment of increasing interest rates it is likely that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will be either at fixed interest rates higher than our current fixed interest rates or at variable rates we have and may continue to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for example during 2019 we through our wholly owned subsidiary sba senior finance ii llc entered into interest rate swaps on a portion of our 2018 term loan which as of december 31 2019 fixed 195 billion in notional value for approximately 525 years receiving interest at one month libor plus 175 basis points and paying a fixed rate of 378 however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk in addition the proposed libor reform could adversely impact these interest rate swaps which receive interest at a rate based on libor furthermore the increase in our use of derivative instruments increases our exposure to counterparty credit risk to the extent that a counterparty to the instrument fails to meet or perform the terms of the instrument 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures or result in nonrenewals that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our wireless service provider customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates or lead to nonrenewals of existing leases furthermore pricing pressures could lead to more prevalent network sharing both domestically and internationally which could reduce the demand for our tower space or lead to nonrenewals of existing leases in addition the increasing number of towers 1 may provide customers the ability to relocate their antennas to other towers if they determine that a more suitable efficient or economical location exists which could lead to nonrenewal of existing leases or 2 may adversely impact our ability to enter into new customer leases this impact may be exacerbated if competitors construct towers near our existing towers any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our growth rate and our future operations 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies who may be substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do 

• international tower companies who have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

the site development segment of our industry is also competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available in the us and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers for example in 2019 we passed on more us acquisitions than we did in 2018 due to asset quality price or lease terms furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do finally laws regulating competition domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm through acquisitions 

our ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated domestically and internationally and the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as planned in 2020 if we are not able to increase our new build tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in developing markets and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were approximately 186 during the year ended december 31 2019 and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions including inflation or currency devaluation 

• laws affecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws new or significantly increased municipal fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively and could materially affect the profitability of our operations 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture 

• governmental regulations and restrictions impacting tower licenses spectrum licenses and concessions including additional restrictions on the use or revocation of such licenses concessions or spectrum and additional conditions to receive or maintain such licenses 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters and employee compensation and benefits matters 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• challenges arising from lessdeveloped infrastructure in certain markets and 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel 

we are also exposed to risks operating in countries with high levels of inflation including the risk that inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators and the risk that adverse economic conditions may discourage growth in consumer demand and consequently reduce our customers’ demand for our site leasing services for example we have a subsidiary in argentina through which we operate our site leasing business the argentinean economy was deemed to be “highly inflationary” from a us gaap perspective as of the second quarter of 2018 and remains highly inflationary as of december 31 2019 as a result we remeasured the financial statements for those operations to the us dollar as of july 1 2018 although this change did not have a material impact on our financial statements as our assets in and revenue from argentina were each less than 1 of consolidated assets and revenue respectively as of december 31 2019 going forward fluctuations in the argentinean peso to us dollar exchange rate could negatively impact our financial results 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in us dollars in brazil canada chile and south africa significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2019 approximately 201 of our total cash site leasing revenue was generated by our international operations of which 142 was generated in nonus dollar currencies including 121 which was denominated in brazilian reais the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility and weakened 79 when comparing the average rate for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 this trend has affected and may in the future continue to affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

furthermore we have intercompany loan agreements with our brazilian and south african subsidiaries to borrow in us dollars as of december 31 2019 the aggregate amounts outstanding under the intercompany loans with our brazilian subsidiary and south african subsidiary were 8398 million and 599 million respectively in accordance with asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future consequently if the us dollar strengthens against the brazilian real or the south african rand our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 we recorded a 90 million gain and a 588 million loss net of taxes respectively on the remeasurement of intercompany loans due to changes in foreign exchange rates 

delays in the rollout of new spectrum due to a slowdown in demand for wireless services the inability or unwillingness of wireless service providers to invest in their infrastructure or delays in the availability of new spectrum could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

we expect a significant portion of our future revenue growth will result from investments in the deployment of new or fallow spectrum by our wireless service provider customers wireless service providers typically invest in their networks in response to consumer demand for additional or higher quality service if consumers significantly reduce their use of wireless services or fail to widely adopt and use new wireless technologies and their products and applications our wireless service provider customers could 

experience a reduction in the rate of growth of or a decrease in demand for their services and therefore reduce the amount they invest in their network 

regardless of consumer demand each wireless service provider must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to deploy new spectrum in their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum if some or all of our wireless service providers are unwilling or unable to significantly invest in their networks it could adversely affect our revenue growth for example it is currently anticipated that if the sprinttmobile merger is consummated i the new combined company will have increased willingness and capacity to invest in its network by deploying its 25ghz spectrum holdings and ii dish network will need to expend significant funds to develop a new nationwide network however if any of these wireless service provider customers or other wireless service providers are unable to access sufficient capital to develop their spectrum then overall demand for our towers and services could be adversely affected 

the fcc plans to auction several new bands of spectrum in the future including cbrs and cband our customers are expected to be the primary winners of these auctions and subsequently deploy this spectrum on our portfolio which would provide us with a revenue growth opportunity any delays or failure of these auctions could negatively impact future demand for our towers similarly any delays in the clearing or availability of this spectrum subsequent to these auctions could delay the related demand for our towers 

new technologies or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks or changes in a wireless service provider customer’s business model may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure in addition as customers deploy increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our wireless service provider customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain sites because portions of the customers’ networks may become redundant in addition other technologies and architectures such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site communications architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business the majority of our tower portfolio is comprised of traditional macro sites and therefore is not as diversified into nonmacro sites and other technologies and architectures as some of our competitors in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure for example our wireless service provider customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements which could result in reduced capital spending or a decision to sell or not to renew their spectrum licenses or concessions any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures or changes in a customer’s business model may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us any such event may have a disproportionate impact on our business as compared to our competitors whose portfolios may be more technologically and architecturally diversified than ours in addition while we are exploring and investing in ancillary services and emerging technologies including our mobile edge computing initiatives those investments may not prove to be profitable which could divert management’s attention from other valueenhancing opportunities 

these factors could also have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to the land under our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their property interests to third parties including property interest aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all we currently have 35year nonterminable leases with oi one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers with respect to 2113 towers that we acquired in 2013 the land underneath these towers is currently subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government will have the right to 1 renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or 2 terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land at the time we acquired the towers we also entered into a right of first refusal 

to purchase such land to the extent that the brazilian regulations permit those assets to be sold brazil has recently adopted a new telecommunications law that is expected to provide oi andor the brazilian government rights to sell the land underlying these assets however as the regulations implementing this new law have not yet been promulgated the amount if at all that we would be required to pay to purchase such interests is undetermined if the concession is not renewed and we are unable to purchase the land then our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease for the year ended december 31 2019 we generated 89 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers 

as of december 31 2019 the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control was approximately 35 years and approximately 86 of our tower structures have ground leases or other property interests maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as a result of those acquisition activities these activities may fail to achieve the benefits we expected from the acquisition or the acquired assets may not meet our internal guidelines for current and future returns particularly if we are required to place greater reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers in individually material acquisitions the impact of these risks is further enhanced in acquisitions of towers in international markets where it may be more challenging to analyze and verify all relevant information with respect to the assets being acquired these risks could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as 1 an adverse financial impact if the acquired towers do not achieve the projected financial results 2 the impact of unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions on our results of operations 3 increased demands on our cash resources that may impact our ability to explore other opportunities 4 undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover 5 an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships 6 additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks and 7 diversion of managerial attention 

the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations is also subject to a number of risks and financial impacts including unforeseen operating difficulties large expenditures diversion of management attention the loss of key customers andor personnel our inability to retain or timely find suitable replacements for key employees and management needed to operate the acquired business and exposure to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in acquisitions of a material number of towers there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating domestic and international acquisitions into our existing business 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 2016 senior notes the 2017 senior notes the 2020 senior notes the senior credit agreement and the agreement for the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each instrument limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter and 2 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 2016 senior notes 2017 senior notes and 2020 senior notes and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases and dividend payments we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel although we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer these agreements do not ensure that those members will continue with us in their current capacity for any particular period of time we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if any of our key personnel were to leave or retire we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment wireless radio stations and radio and television broadcast stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television broadcast stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers 

vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us in our international operations the impact of these zoning permitting and related regulations and restrictive covenants on our new builds colocations and operations could be exacerbated as some of these markets may lack established permitting processes for towers have inconsistencies between national and local regulations and have other barriers to timely construction and permitting of towers as a result tower construction in some of our international markets may be delayed or halted or our acquired towers may not perform as anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

as part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our or our vendors’ computer systems and backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results in addition security incidents that impact our customers and other business partners could adversely affect our business and operating results furthermore our investments in ancillary services and emerging technologies including our mobile edge computing initiatives may leave us more vulnerable to security incidents create new exposure for us to different types of security incidents or exacerbate the impact of such incidents on our business and operating results 

damage from natural disasters and other unforeseen events could adversely affect us 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes or may collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies in addition we have energy sources on some of our tower sites and any unforeseen incident may cause damage to surrounding property we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers and damage to surrounding property but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower an incident involving our towers or tower sites for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers or surrounding property could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and may harm our reputation 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we may be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including expenses for ground leases and other property interests if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols generated prior to the 2018 tax year can be carried forward and used for up to 20 years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire nols generated starting in the 2018 tax year can be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to the 80 utilization limitation we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations if our tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties or make additional distributions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 “code” we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us and other foreign governments impose requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our status as a reit 

complying with the reit requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders for example to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate assets 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify and be subject to tax as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing nols to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our 

reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code these distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities furthermore our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements these actions could have the effect of reducing our income amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced 

we may be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage decrease our adjusted funds from operations or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases 

thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore compliance with the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required reit distributions 

the senior credit agreement the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2016 senior notes 2017 senior notes and 2020 senior notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders under the senior credit agreement our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our reit distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100 of our reit taxable income so long as sba senior finance ii’s ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda does not exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter in addition under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions or securitization a failure to comply with the debt service coverage ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us finally while the indentures governing the 2016 senior notes 2017 senior notes and 2020 senior notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a reit or to avoid entity level taxation this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2016 senior notes 2017 senior notes or 2020 senior notes as applicable have not otherwise been accelerated 

if these limitations prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limitations do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax and potentially the nondeductible 4 excise tax on the retained amounts 

our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

reits are required to distribute annually at least 90 of their reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain as of december 31 2019 6529 million of our federal nols are attributes of the reit we may use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized which may adversely affect the market value of our class a common stock the code places limitations upon the future availability of nols based upon changes in our equity if these occur our ability to offset future income with existing nols may be limited 

the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by the board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by the board of directors and will depend on among other factors our nols our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds consequently our future distribution levels may fluctuate 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which would reduce our cash flows and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a trs if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

our trs assets and operations also will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located if we continue our international expansion we may have additional trs assets and operations subject to such taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 21 on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring during our first five years as a reit up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2016 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis in those assets as of january 1 2016 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability we cannot however assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 

our use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to represent more than 20 25 for taxable years beginning prior to december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit if we continue our international expansion we may have increased net income from trss which may cause us to rise above these thresholds 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof with or without retroactive application 

could materially and adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification 

our board’s ability to revoke our reit qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our shareholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders if any in computing our taxable income and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 and may not be able to continue to operate successfully as a reit in addition we are required to maintain substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a reit we have also incurred additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to operating as a reit and our management and other personnel have devoted additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the code these factors may adversely affect our performance as a reit if our performance is adversely affected it could affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock reit ordinary income distributions are generally eligible for a 20 deduction to the extent distributed out of the reit’s taxable income 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent our shareholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 

in order for us to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification no more than 50 in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by 5 or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax as a reit has been made in addition our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made our articles of incorporation contain reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits these ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment 

of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 







 item 2 properties 

we own our headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently have approximately 160000 square feet of office space we also own or have entered into longterm leases for international and regional locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities and in certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of december 31 2019 approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases and other property interests including renewal options under our control is 35 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple five year renewal periods for a total of 30 years or more 

most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas we measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located as of december 31 2019 we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure

as of february 18 2020 there were 120 record holders of our class a common stock 

dividends 

as a reit we are required to distribute annually at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain as of december 31 2019 6529 million of the federal nols are attributes of the reit we may use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as our nols have been fully utilized the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by the board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in 

quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual amount timing and frequency of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of the board of directors and will be declared based upon various factors many of which are beyond our control

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america canada and south africa our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 977 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2019 in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2019 we owned 32403 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states south america central america canada and south africa as of december 31 2019 1 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and 2 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2019 in addition as of december 31 2019 approximately 305 of our total towers are located in brazil and less than 3 of our total towers are located in any of our other international markets each country is considered a market we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider 

tenants including att tmobile sprint verizon wireless oi sa telefonica claro and tim wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years to 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in south africa and our central and south american markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with multiple five year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america and south africa escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying rent related to ground leases and other property interests 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• cash and noncash rental expense on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• lease initial direct cost amortization 

in the united states and our international markets ground leases and other property interests are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple renewal periods which are at our option ground leases and other property interests provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in our south american markets and south africa adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2019 approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases and other property interests tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in brazil canada chile and south africa significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other property interests and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 



we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements during 2020 we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over 2019 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service 

providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology eg metropcs leap clearwire and sprint iden 

site development 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 15 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

capital allocation strategy 

our capital allocation strategy is aimed at increasing shareholder value through investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value and by returning cash generated by our operations in the form of cash dividends while the addition of a cash dividend to our capital allocation strategy has provided us with a new tool to return value to our shareholders we will also continue to make investments focused on increasing adjusted funds from operations per share to achieve this we expect to continue to deploy capital to portfolio growth and stock repurchases subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements available funds and market conditions while maintaining our target leverage levels key elements of our capital allocation strategy include 

portfolio growth we intend to continue to grow our asset portfolio domestically and internationally primarily through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers that meet our internal return on invested capital criteria 

stock repurchase program we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below its intrinsic value we believe that share repurchases when purchased at the right price will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share 

dividend in 2019 we added dividends as an additional component of our strategy of returning value to shareholders we do not expect our dividend to require any changes in our leverage and we believe it will allow us to continue to focus on building and buying quality assets and opportunistically buying back our stock while the timing and amount of future dividends will be subject to approval by our board of directors we believe that our future cash flow generation will permit us to grow our cash dividend in the future 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2019 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five years to 10 years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets revenue from site leasing represents 92 of our total revenue 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that are billed at contractual rates revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved which are determined based on costs incurred amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized over time determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion refer to note 5 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

the site development segment represents approximately 8 of our total revenues we account for site development revenue in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers which was adopted on january 1 2018 by applying the modified retrospective transition method payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements furthermore these contracts do not typically include variable consideration therefore the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard had no impact on our financial results the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods the adoption of the new standard had no impact to net income on an ongoing basis 

the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31 2019 and 2018 was 1321 million and 1110 million respectively of which 407 and 271 million related to the site development segment respectively we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers in addition we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable refer to note 15 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment 

lease accounting 

we adopted asu no 201602 leases “topic 842” using the modified retrospective adoption method with an effective date of january 1 2019 this standard requires all lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments the adoption of the new lease standard had a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets but did not have a significant impact on our lease classification or a material impact on our consolidated statements of operations and liquidity additionally the adoption of topic 842 did not have a material impact on our debt covenant compliance under our current agreements we have elected to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component for all underlying classes of assets 

in order to calculate our lease liability we make certain assumptions related to lease term and discount rate in making the determination of the period for which we are reasonably certain to remain on the site we will assume optional renewals are reasonably certain of being exercised for the greater of 1 a period sufficient to cover all tenants under their current committed term where we have provided rights to the tower not to exceed the contractual ground lease terms including renewals and 2 a period sufficient to recover the investment of significant leasehold improvements located on the site for the discount rate we use the rate implicit in the lease when available to discount lease payments to present value however our ground leases and other property interests generally do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate therefore we estimate the incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on the lease term and lease currency we use publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when 

calculating our incremental borrowing rates refer to note 2 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further discussion on lease accounting 

results of operations 

this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding adjusted ebitda a nongaap measure we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition and new business initiatives related adjustments and expenses asset impairment and decommission costs interest income interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization and provision for or benefit from taxes 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits in addition adjusted ebitda is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2016 senior notes 2017 senior notes and 2020 senior notes adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 



1 total interest expense includes interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees 

2 provision for taxes includes 943 and 802 of franchise taxes for the year ended 2019 and 2018 respectively reflected in selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 

adjusted ebitda increased 1056 million for the year ended december 31 2019 as compared to the prior year on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda increased 1181 million these changes were primarily due to an increase in segment operating profit partially offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftop s and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications  which we collectively refer to as “ towers ” and the location of the towers as “ sites ”   our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america and canada our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 980 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2018  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2018  we owned 29578 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 9700 actual or potential site s approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2018  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business through organic growth and expansion of our tower portfolio to create shareholder value   we believe that the longterm and repetitive nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business will permit us to maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending which arises in our site development business  key elements of our strategy include 

organic growth 





systematic t ower portfolio growth    we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable  consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our domestic and international t ower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses consequently w e intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures we believe that one of the best uses of our liquidity including cash from operating activities and borrowings is to acquire andor build new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our lo ngterm target leverage ratios 





 









new build program – we build new towers domestically and internationally in our new build program we construct tower structures 1 under buildtosuit arrangements or 2 in locations that are strategically chosen by us under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relatio nships we seek   to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to organically grow our site leasing business and to capture new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

controlling our underlying land positions  we believe that a primary component of a strong site leasing business is the ability to control the underlying land positions consequently we h ave purchased andor entered into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2018  approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 36 years as of december 31 2018  approximately 79 of our tower structures ha d ground leases maturing in the next 10 years 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless data traffic will require wireless service providers to continue to increase the capacity of their networks and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 



 





we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us 

our businesses 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 980 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments  domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2018  we owne d 16263 sites in the united states and its territories  for the year ended december 31 2018  we generated 804 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites we derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from att sprint t mobile and verizon wireless in the united states  our tenant leases are ge nerally for an initial ter m of five to ten years with multiple 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year our ground leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple 5year renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually as of december 31 2018  1 no us state or territory included more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and 2 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  

international site leasing 

we currently operate in 12 international markets throughout canada central america and south america our largest international market is brazil as of december 31 2018  we owned 13315 site s in our inte rnational markets of which   289 of our global site s are lo cated in brazil an d less than 3 of our global site s are located in each of our other international markets each country is considered a market  w e continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towe rs since we first entered the central and south american markets we have built or acquired 13016 site s as of december 31 2018 and continue to expand in these markets to respond to growing demand our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to continue to expand operations through acquisitions and new builds as well as organic lease up on our existing towers 

we deri ve international site leasing revenues primarily from oi sa telefonica claro and tim in   canada  our ten ant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar fixed rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index in certain international markets such as brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site tenant leases in south america typically provide a passthrough charge for the underlying ground lease rent in addition to the base tenant rent  our ground leases in canada central america and south america generally have similar terms and 

 

conditions as those in the united states except   that the annual escalators in our south american ground leases are based on a cost of living index our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in united states dollars in brazil canada and chile significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina  and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are d en ominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars   

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as site acquisition services and the installation of antennas and other equipment at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 identification of potential locations for carrier equipment on new and existing towers along with other wireless infrastructure 3 support in leasing of the location 4 obtaining zoning approvals and permits 5 tower and related site construction 6 antenna installation and 7 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through market and regional offices these market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

customers 

we lease tower space   to and perform site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regiona l local or private operators internationally we lease tower space to all the major service providers in canada central america and south america 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 

﻿ 



in addition to the big 4 wireless carriers  att t mobile sprint and verizon wireless w e have also provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 





we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents director s and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customer relationship s our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best 

 

relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our si te leasing activities are 1 large independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown c astle international 2 a number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 owners and operators of alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards utility poles an d electric transmission towers 

international site leasing – internationally o ur competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks large multinational national and regional independent tower companies  and alternative facilities such as rooftop outdoor and indoor das networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers    we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the domestic and international site leasing business 

site development – the site development business is competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local region and market areas while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development companies zoning consultants real estate firms wireless construction companies tower owners telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our corporate offices are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida we also have employees located in our international regional and local offices as of december 31 2018  we had 1347 employees of which 357 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 804 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  both the federal communications commission the “ fcc ” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations   govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its princip als are subject to a denial of f ederal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it 

 

is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers fcc rules establish presumptively reasonable time periods for state and local authorities to act on applications to collocate a facility or deploy a facility such as a tower in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria however in august 2018 the fcc issued a declaratory ruling stating that express and de facto moratoria on deployment of telecommunications facilities violate the communications act although this fcc ruling is currently the subject of petitions for reconsideration before the fcc and petitions for review before a federal appellate court it remains in effect 

international regulations  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous 

 

burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2018  we had 820 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 157 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2017  we had 1205 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 92 million of annual revenue

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results  ability to service our indebtedness  and stock price could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar or acquired technologies may be discontinued att verizon and sprint have grown through acquisitions of other wireless service providers as a result the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks and in the case of sprint the nextel iden network was discontinued these consolidations have led and may continue to lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases in addition in april 2018 tmobile and sprint entered into a definitive agreement to merge subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions if this potential transaction closes it may lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases as a result of the rationalization of duplicative or overlapping parts of their networks as of december 31 2018  tmobile and spri nt represented approximately 164 and 158   of our total site leasing revenue respectively the revenue generated from each of tmobile and sprint on overlapping sites represented less than 65 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2018  excluding  and incremental to  the impact from previously disclosed expected consolidation churn from tmobile’s metropcs and sprint’s clearwire networks in addition these overlapping sites have an average remaining current term of approximately 36 years and 49 years with tmobile and sprint respectively 

if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us these consolidations could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness these risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation in addition our customers may decide not to renew certain tower leases on towers that do not have duplicative or overlapping antennas which could further impact our operating results 

 

consolidation may also occur among wireless service provider customers in our international markets for example in january 2019 claro acquired telefonica’s assets in guatemala and el salvador two markets in which we own towers consolidations in our international markets may also lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases which could adversely affect our operating results 

in addition the market price of our class a common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of the announcement or consummation of wireless service provider customer consolidations and their impact on our future operating results 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time period s derived from these customers 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

﻿ 



﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts i n the u nited states and canada  ea ch site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple 5 year renewal periods at the option of the tenant site leasing contracts in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple 5 year renewal periods however  if any of our significant site leasing 

 

customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected in addition many of our tenants in our international markets are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities which may impact their creditworthiness for example in january 2018 oi sa “oi” our largest customer in brazil emerged from bankruptcy with a reorganization plan and is expected to resolve all of its prepetition obligations however if oi is unable to successfully fulfill its reorganization obligations or cannot operate its business on a goforward basis it could adversely affect our future results of operations 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful   in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our deficit the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2018 and 2017  

﻿ 



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness  subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage for example on march 9 2018 we through a new york common law trust issued  64 00 million in tower securities and on april 11 2018 we secured a new 24 billion term loan  which contributed to the net 6230 m illion increase of our total indebtedness during 2018  

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including share repurchases tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures  or to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

f luctuations in market interest rates or changes in central bank monetary policy may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur pursuant to our revolving credit facility and term loan and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future 

 

refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense arising on our existing and future floating rate indebtedness or upon refinancing of our fixed rate debt pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement the interest rate that we pay on indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility or term loans varies based on a fixed margin over either a base rate or a eurodollar rate which references the libor rate as of december 31 2018  this represented approximately 27 billion or 271 of our total indebtedness as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk interest rates including libor have recently increased and may increase in future periods  if interest rates continue to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease in addition libor is the subject of recent proposals for reform which may cause libor to disappear entirely or perform differently than in the past the consequences of these developments cannot be predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt 

furthermore in an environment of increasing interest rates it is likely that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will be either at fixed interest rates higher than our current fixed interest rates or at variable rates we have and may continue to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for example on february 1 2019 we through our wholly owned subsidiary sba senior finance ii llc entered into a fouryear interest rate swap on a portion of our 2018 term loan we swapped 12 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month libor plus 200 basis points for a fixed rate of 4495 per annum however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

﻿ 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures or result in nonrenewals that may materially and adversely affect us   

our industry is highly competitive and our wireless service provider customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space however we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition the increasing number of towers 1 may provide customers the ability to relocate thei r antennas to other towers if they determine that a more suitable efficient or economic al location exists which could lead to nonrenewal of existing leases or 2 may adversely impact our ability to enter into new customer leases this impact may be exacerbated if competitors construct towers near our existing towers any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our growth rate and our future operations 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies who may be   substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do  

• international tower companies who have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

the site development segment of our industry is also competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating prof it could be adversely affected 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry  there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available in the us and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers for example in 2018  we passed on more us acquisitions than we did in 2017 due to asset quality price or lease terms furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater f inancial resources than we do finally laws regulating 

 

competition domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm through acquisitions  

o ur ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated  domestically and internationally and the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2019  if we are not able to increase our new build tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in developing markets  and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were approximately   182 during the year ended december 31 2018  and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions  including inflation or currency devaluation  

• laws a ffecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws  new or significantly increased municipal fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively and could materially affect the profitability of our operations  

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture  

• restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters and employee compensation and benefits matters  

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• challenges arising from lessdeveloped infrastructure in certain markets  and 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel 

we are also exposed to risks operating in countries with high levels of inflation including the risk that inflation rates exceed our fixed escalator percentages in markets where our leases include fixed escalators and the risk that adverse economic conditions may discourage growth in consumer demand and consequently reduce our customers’ demand for our site leasing services for example we have a subsidiary in argentina through which we operate our site leasing busin ess  the argentinean economy was deemed to be “highly inflationary” from a us gaap perspective as of the second quarter of 2018 as a result we remeasured the financial statements for those operations to the us dollar as of july 1 2018 although this change did not have a material impact on our financial statements as our assets in and revenue from argentina were each less than 1 of consolidated assets and revenue respectively as of december 31 2018  going forward fluctuations in the argentinean peso to us dollar exchange rate could negatively impact our financial results 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in us dollars in brazil canada and chile  significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated 

 

expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina  and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and oth er towerrelated expenses are deno minated in a mix of local currency and us dollars our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2018  approximately   193 of our total cash site leasin g revenue was generated by our i nternational operations of which 139 was generated in nonu  s  dollar currencies including 125 which was denominat ed in brazilian rea is  the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility a nd weakened   120 when comparing the average rate for the years ended   december 31 2018 and 2017  this trend has affected and may in the future continue to affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us   d ollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

furthermore we have intercompany loan agreement s which permit one of our brazilian entities to borrow amounts up to  1250 m illion in us dollars  as of december 31 2018  the aggre gate outstanding balance under these agreements was 5369 million in accordance with asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future  consequently if the us dollar strengthen s against the brazilian real our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017  we recorded an   891 million loss and an   88 million   loss  respectively    on the remeasurement of the intercompany loan due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

new technologies or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks or changes in a wireless service provider customer’s business model may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure in addition as customers deploy increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our wireless service provider customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure or may result in the decommissioning of equipment on certain sites because portions of the customers’ networks may become redundant in addition other technologies and architectures such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site communications architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business the majority of our tower portfolio is comprised of traditional macro sites and therefore is not as diversified into nonmacro sites and other technologies and architectures as some of our competitors in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure further a customer may decide to no longer outsource wireless infrastructure or otherwise change its business model any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures or changes in a customer’s business model may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us any such event may have a disproportionate impact on our business as compared to our competitors whose portfolios may be more technologically and architecturally diversified than ours 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to the land under our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all in addition the land underlying the 2113 towers we acquired in 2013 from oi one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers  is subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025  at the end of the term the brazilian gove rnment will have the right to 1  renew the concession up on newly negotiated terms or 2  terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land although oi has entered into a nonterminable lease with us for 35 years if the concession is not renewed our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease for the year ended december 31 2018  we generated 100 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers of which 64 related to oi and 36 represented revenue from colocated tenants 

 

as of december 31 2018  the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was approximately 36 years and approximately 79 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of ope rations or financial condition 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues and we cannot control that demand 

additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks if consumers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications or new technologies our wireless service provider customers could experience a decrease in demand for their services in addition delays or changes in the deployment of new technologies could further slow additional investment by our customers in their networks there can be no assurance that 3g 4g including longterm evolution advanced wireless service in certain bands or other newer wireless technologies such as 5g will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g in the united states experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries the deployment of 4g in the united states has experienced delays and continued deployment of 4g in emerging markets could experience delays and the deployment of 5g may experience similar delays the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated particularly in certain of our international markets regardless of consumer demand each wireless service provider must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless service providers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business these factors could also have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as a result of those acquisition activities these activities may fail to achieve the benefits we expected from the acquisition or the acquired assets may not meet our internal guidelines for current and future returns particularly if we are required to place greater reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers in individually material acquisitions the impact of these risks is further enhanced in acquisitions of towers in international markets where it may be more challenging to analyze and verify all relevant information with respect to the assets being acquired these risks could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as  1  an adverse financial impact if the acquired towers do not achieve the projected financial results  2  the impact of unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions on our results of operations  3  increased demands on our cash resources that may impact our ability to explore other opportunities  4 undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover  5  an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships  6  additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks  and  7  diversion of managerial attention 

the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations is also subject to a number of risks and financial impacts including unforeseen operating difficulties large expenditures diversion of management attention the loss of key customers andor personnel our inability to retain or timely find suitable replacements for key employees and management needed to operate the acquired business and exposure to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in acquisitions of a material number of towers there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating domestic and international acquisitions into our existing business 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 2014 senior notes  the 2016 senior notes  and the 2017 senior notes  the senior credit agreement and the agreement for the   mortgage loan underlying the tower securities contain restrictive covenants imposing 

 

significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each in strument limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated net debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 65 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account in stead of being released to the b orrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the b orrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries w e conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes  and 2017 senior notes and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases  we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel although we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer these agreements do not ensure that those members will continue with us in their current capacity for any particular period of time we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if any of our key personnel were to leave or retire we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment wireless radio stations and radio and television broadcast stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television broadcast stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us in our international operations the impact of these zoning permitting and related regula tions and restrictive covenants on our new builds colocations and operations could be exacerbated as some of these markets may lack established permitting processes for towers have inconsistencies between national and local regulations and have other barriers to timely construction and permitting of towers as a result tower construction in some of our international markets may be delayed or halted or our acquired towers may not perform as anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

a s part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems  or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our or our vendors’ computer systems and backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters and other unforeseen events   

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes or may collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies  we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and may harm our reputation  

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we may be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols generated prior to the 2018 tax year can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire nols generated starting in the 2018 tax year can be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to the 80 utilization limitation we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations if our tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties  or make additional distributions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 “code”  we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us and other foreign government s impose requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the recently adopted us tax legislation may result in additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results and profitability 

in december 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revised the c ode by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 imposing a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation of foreign earnings commonly referred to as the “transition tax” limiting deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation and implementing a territorial tax system 

 

the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2017 and in 2018 and may impact our consolidated results of operatio ns in future periods in particular the transition tax resulted in a onetime income inclusion of 492 million related to previously unremitted earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries which we will elect to include in income over the next eight tax years the inclusion will be offset by our existing nols to the extent possible during the eightyear recognition period in addition we recorded a onetime reduction to our deferred tax asset and offsetting valuation allowance in the amount of 255 million 192 million related to the reduction of the us corporate tax rate  and 63 million related to the new limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation  

risks related to our status as a reit 

﻿ 

complying with the reit requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities 

﻿ 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders for example to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary “trs” generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 20 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate assets 

﻿ 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify and be subject to tax as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing nols to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code these distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities furthermore our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements these actions could have the effect of reducing our income amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness 

﻿ 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

﻿ 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis 

﻿ 

we received an opinion of our special reit tax counsel with respect to our qualification as a reit investors should be aware however that opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or any court the opinion represents only the view of such counsel based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income the opinion is expressed as of the date issued our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 

﻿ 

 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced 

﻿ 

we may be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

﻿ 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage decrease our adjusted funds from operations per share or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases 

﻿ 

thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore compliance with the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which would increase our total leverage 

﻿ 

covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required reit distributions 

﻿ 

the senior credit agreement the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes and 2017 senior notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders under the senior credit agreement our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our reit distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100 of our reit taxable income so long as sba senior finance ii’s ratio of consolidated net debt to annualized borrower ebitda does not exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter in addition under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions or securitization a failure to comply with the debt service coverage ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us finally while the indentures governing the 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes and 2017 senior notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a reit or to avoid entity level taxation this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes or 2017 senior notes as applicable have not otherwise been accelerated 

﻿ 

if these limitations prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limitations do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax and potentially the nondeductible 4 excise tax on the retained amounts 

﻿ 

our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

reits are required to distribute annually at least 90 of their reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain a s of december 31 2018  7554 m illion of our federal nols are attributes of the reit we may   use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized the code places limitations upon the future availability of nols based upon changes in our equity if these occur our ability to offset future income with existing nols may be limited we currently expect that we will utilize available nols to reduce all or a portion of our reit taxable income and therefore we may not initially make any distributions which may adversely affect the market value of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by the board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by the board of directors 

 

and will depend on among other factors our nols our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds consequently our future distribution levels may fluctuate 

﻿ 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which would reduce our cash flows and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

﻿ 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a trs if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

﻿ 

our trs assets and operations also will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located if we continue our international expansion we may have additional trs assets and operations subject to such taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

﻿ 

we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate  currently 21  on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring during our first five years as a reit up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2016 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis in those assets as of january 1 2016 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability we cannot however assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 

﻿ 

our use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

﻿ 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to represent more than 2 0  25 for taxable years beginning prior to december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit if we continue our international expansion we may have increased net income from trss which may cause us to rise above these thresholds 

﻿ 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

﻿ 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification 

﻿ 

our board’s ability to revoke our reit qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders 

﻿ 

our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our shareholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders if any in computing our taxable income and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders 

﻿ 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

﻿ 

we began operating as a reit in 2016 and may not be able to continue to operate successfully as a reit in addition we are required to maintain substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a reit we have also incurred additional legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur prior to operating as a reit and our management and other personnel have devoted additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the code these factors may adversely affect our performance as a reit if our performance is adversely affected it could affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 

 

﻿ 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

﻿ 

the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock reit ordinary income distributions are generally eligible for a 20 deduction to the extent distributed out of the reit’s taxable income 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent our shareholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 

in order for us to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification no more than 50 in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax as a reit has been made in addition our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made our articles of incorporation contain reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits these ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests   







 item 2 properties 

we own our headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently have approximately 160000 square feet of office space we also own or have entered into longterm leases for international and regional locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities and in certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of december 31 2018  approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including 

 

renewal options under our control is   36 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple 5year renewal periods for a total of thirty years or more 

most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas we measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located as of december 31 2018  we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america and canada our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 980 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2018  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2018  we owned 29578 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 9700 actual or potential site s approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2018  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america as of december 31 2018  1  no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and  2 no u s state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2018  in addition as of december 31 2018  approximately 289 of our total towers are located in brazil and less than 3 of our total towers are located in any of our other international markets each country is considered a market we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att tmobile verizon wireless sprint oi sa telefonica claro and tim wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site in the united states and canada our 

 

tenant leases are generall y for an initial term of five to ten years with multiple 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year   including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying ground lease rent 

ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple 5year renewal periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in our south american markets adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2018  approximately 71 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3  taxes in brazil  canada  and chile significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in colombia argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance 

• lease origination cost amortization and 

• straightline rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property interests 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn   which refers to when a cus tomer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology  we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements during 2019  we expect organic site leasing revenue   in both our domestic and international segments to increase over   2018   levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do 

 

not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology e g iden metropcs clearwire and cricket 

site development services   

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations   

for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

capital allocation strategy 

our capital allocation strategy is to prioritize investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value a primary goal of our capital allocation strategy is to increase our adjusted funds from operations per share to achieve this we expect we would continue to deploy capital between portfolio growth and stock repurchases subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements available funds and market conditions while maintaining our target leverage levels key elements of our capital allocation strategy include 

portfolio growth  we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2018  included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets  revenue from site leasing represents 93 of our total revenue   

 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a fixed price basis that   are billed at contractual rates revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved which are determined based on costs incurred  amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized over time determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion refer to note 9 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

the site development segment represents approximately 7 of our total revenues we account for site development revenue in accordance with asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers which was adopted on january 1 2018 by applying the modified retrospective transition method payment terms do not result in any significant financing arrangements furthermore these contracts do not typically include variable consideration therefore the transaction price that is recognized over time is generally the amount of the total contract the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard had no impact on our financial results the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods the adoption of the new standard had no impact to net income on an ongoing basis 

the accounts receivable balance for the years ended december 31 2018 and 2017 was 1110 million and 907 million respectively of which 271 and 208 million related to the site development segment respectively we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers in addition we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable refer to note 18 in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report for further detail of the site development segment 

recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

in february 2016 the fasb issued asu 201602 leases the standard requires lessees to recognize a rightofuse asset and a lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments for all leases with a term greater than 12 months the accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from existing guidance the company has adopt ed this standard as of january 1 2019 this guidance will have a material impact on the company’s consolidated balance sheet due to the recognition of lease liabilities for its ground leases of approximately 2 3 billion to  27 billion adoption of this guidance will not have a significant impact on the company’s lease classification a material impact on its consolidated statement of operations or a notable impact on its liquidity additionally the standard will have no impact on the company’s debtcovenant compliance under its current agreements 

in july 2018 the fasb issued additional guidance on the accounting for leases the guidance provides companies with another transition method that allows entities to recognize a cumulativeeffect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption under this method previously presented years’ financial positions and results are not adjusted the company adopted this alternative transition method the new guidance also provides lessors with a practical expedient by class of underlying asset to not separate nonlease components from the associated lease component if 1 the nonlease components would otherwise be accounted for under the new revenue recognition standard 2 both the timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the nonlease components and associated lease component and 3 if accounted for separately the lease component would be classified as an operating lease the company adopted this practical expedi ent in its accounting for leases 

results of operations 

this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding a nongaap measure adjusted ebitda we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016 we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans in addition we believe that excluding the oi reserve which represents a 165 million onetime provision for doubtful accounts recorded in 2016  provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a nonrecurring event 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related adjustments and expenses asset impairment and decommission costs interest income interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization and provision for or benefit from taxes 

﻿ 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits in addition adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures re lating to the 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes and 2017 senior notes adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance

our current primary market risk exposure is 1 interest rate risk relating to our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates if at all and 2 interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on the variable portion of our 2018 term loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our revolving credit facility which are at floating rates we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt  including a fouryear interest rate swap on a portion of our 2018 term loan entered into on february 1 2019  we swapped 12 billion of notional value accruing interest at one month libor plus 200 basis points for a fixed rate of 4495 per annum while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in brazil canada chile peru argentina colombia and to a lesser extent our markets in central america  in each of these countries we pay most of our selling general and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency in addition in brazil  canada and chile we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency in colombia argentina and peru we receive our revenue and pay our operating expenses in a mix of local currency and us dollars all transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for 

 

the year ended december 31 2018  approximately 133 of our revenues and approximately 169 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the brazilian real from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2018  as of december 31 2018  the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating income to decline by approximately 11 and 05  respectively for the year ended december 31 2018  

as of december 31 2018  we had intercompany debt which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as settlement of this debt is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future  any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income a change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at december 31 2018 would have resulted in approximately 536 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in other income  expense  net in our consolidated statements of o perations for the year ended december 31 2018

 item 1 business   

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftop s  and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “ towers ” or “ sites ”   our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america and canada our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 987 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2017  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2017  we owned 27909 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 9000 actual or potential site s approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2017  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america we derive site leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 968 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three fiscal years our site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2017  we owne d 15979 sites in the united states and its territories  for the year ended december 31 2017  we generated 806 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites we derive domestic site leasing revenues primarily from att t mobile sprint and verizon wireless w ire less service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at each individual site  in the united states  our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year  our ground leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of fiveyear periods  at our option  and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually   as of december 31 2017  1 no us state or territory included more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and 2 no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  

international site leasing 

we currently operate in 12 international markets throughout canada central america and south america our largest international market is brazil as of december 31 2017  we owned 11930 towers in our inte rnational markets a s of december 31 2017    301 of our total towers are lo cated in brazil and   less than 3 of our total towers are located in each of our other international markets each country is considered a market  w e continue to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers d uring 2017 we continued our international expansion with our acquisition of sites in peru and argentina as well as additional sites in existing international markets we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments   our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to continue to expand operations throu gh acquis itions and   new builds  as well as organic lease up on our existing towers  

we deri ve international site leasing revenues primarily from oi sa telefonica claro and tim   in canada  our ten ant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods  in central america we have similar fixed rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index in brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site tenant leases in south america typically provide a passthrough charge for the underlying ground lease rent in addition to the base tenant rent  our 

 

ground leases in canada central america and south america generally have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states except that the annual escalators in our south american ground leases are based on a cost of living index   our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denomi nated in united states dollars in brazil  canada  chile and colombia  significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are dominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

domestic and international expansion 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of several different investment return metrics  review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks ii increased consumer mobile data traffic such as media streaming mobile apps and games web browsing and email and iii incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments since we first entered the central and south american markets we have built or acquired 11655 towers as of december 31 2017   and continue to expand in these markets to respond to growing demand 

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 







in our new build program we construct tower structures 1   under buildtosuit arrangements   or 2 in locations that are strategically chosen by us under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will n eed to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers that generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or compan ies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and equipment on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through market and regional offices these market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless data traffic will require wireless service providers to continue to increase the capacity of their networks and we believe that the continued capacity increases will require our customers to install equipment at new sites and add new equipment at existing sites we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 







we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into steady leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business    the long term and repetitive nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can generate additional lease revenue and be achieved at a low incremental cost we measure the available capacity of our existing sites to support additional tenants by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2017  we had an average of 17 tenants per tower structure 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio    we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable  consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry we intend to use a portion of our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries we believe that our 

 

industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2017  approximately 70 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 33 years as of december 31 2017  approximately 69 of our tower structures ha d ground leases maturing in the next 10 years 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relatio nships we are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have leased tower space and performed site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regiona l local or private operators internationally we lease tower space to all the major service providers in canada central america and south america 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 

﻿ 



in addition to the big 4 wireless carriers  att t mobile sprint and verizon wireless w e have also provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 

﻿ 



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 





we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our 

 

corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our si te leasing activities are 1 large independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

international site leasing – internationally o ur competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks large national and regional independent tower companies  and alternative facilities such as rooftop outdoor and indoor das networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers  

site development – the site development business is competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local region and market areas while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our corporate offices are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida we also have employees located in our international regional and local offices as of december 31 2017  we had 1291 employees of which 303 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 806 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2017  both the federal communications commission the “ fcc ” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations   govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its princip als are subject to a denial of f ederal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a no 

 

hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations 

 

and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2017  we had 1205 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 92 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2016  we had 955 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 87 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed under executed contracts as of december 31 2017  we had approximately 475 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 260 million as of december 31 2016

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results  ability to service our indebtedness  and stock price could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar  or acquired technologies may be discontinued  in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks and in the case of sprint the nextel iden network was discontinued which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers during 2013 sprint acquired clearwire communications and tmobile acquired metropcs and in 2014 att acquired leap wireless cricket wireless th ese consolidation s have led and may continue to lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us th ese consolidation s could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results   and our ability to service our indebtedness these risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation  

in addition the market price of our class a common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of the announcement or consummation of wireless service provider customer consolidations and their impact on our future operating results 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our deficit the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2017 and 2016  

﻿ 



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage for example on october 13 2017  we issued  7500 m illion of unsecured senior notes  which contributed to the 530 million increase of our total indebtedness during 2017  

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including share repurchases tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures  or to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions  share repurchases or other opportunities and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates or changes in central bank monetary policy may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur pursuant to our revolving credit facility and term loans and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense arising on our existing and future floating rate indebtedness or upon refinancing of our fixed rate debt pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement the interest rate that we pay on indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility or term loans varies based on a fixed margin over either a base rate or a eurodollar rate which references the libor rate as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk interest rates including libor have recently increased and are expected to continue to increase in future periods if interest rates continue to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease furthermore in an environment of increasing interest rates it is likely that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will be either at fixed interest rates higher than our current fixed interest rates or at variable rates in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk we currently have no interest rate swaps 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

on june 20 2016 oi sa “oi” our largest customer in brazil filed a petition for judicial reorganization in brazil for the year ended december 31 2017 oi comprised approximately 75 of our total site leasing revenue while we initially recorded a 165 million bad debt provision during the second quarter of 2016 relating to amounts owed or potentially owed by oi as of the petition date since that date we have continued to do business with oi in the ordinary course on january 8 2018 oi’s reorganization plan was approved by the brazilian courts and oi is expected to resolve all its prepetition obligations in accordance with the terms of the plan however if oi is unable to successfully fulfill its reorganization obligations or cannot operate its business on a goforward basis it could adversely affect our future results of operation 

 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time period s derived from these customers 

﻿ 



﻿ 

﻿ 

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

﻿ 



﻿ 

﻿ 



﻿ 

we derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the us and canada and renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant site leasing contracts in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods however  if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected in addition many of our tenants in our international markets are subsidiaries of global telecommunications companies these subsidiaries may not have the explicit or implied financial support of their parent entities which may impact their creditworthiness 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry  there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available in the us and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers for example in 2017 we passed on more us acquisitions than we did in 2016 due to asset quality price or lease terms furthermore  to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do finally laws regulating competition domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm through acquisitions  

o ur ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds domestically and internationally than anticipated and the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2018  if we are not able to increase our new build tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures or result in nonrenewals that may materially and adversely affect us   

our industry is highly competitive and our wireless service provider customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space however we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition the increasing number of towers 1 may provide customers the ability to relocate their antennae to other towers if they determine that a more suitable efficient or economic location exists which could lead to nonrenewal of existing leases or 2 may adversely impact our ability to enter into new customer leases any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our growth rate and our future operations 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies who may be   substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do  and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

the site development segment of our industry is also competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues and we cannot control that demand 

additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks if consumers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers c ould experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service provider must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless service provide rs may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada central america and south america and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were approximately   182 during the year ended december 31 2017  and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership or requiring reversion or divestiture  

• laws effecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel and 

• language and cultural differences 

 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to the land under our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all in addition the land underlying the 2113 towers we acquired in 2013 from oi one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers  is subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025  at the end of the term the brazilian government will have the right to i renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or ii terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land although oi has entered into a nonterminable lease with us for 35 years if the concession is not renewed our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease for the year ended december 31 2017  we generated 115 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers of which 73 related to oi and 42 represented revenue from colocated tenants 

as of december 31 2017  the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was approximately 33 years and approximately 69 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of ope rations or financial condition 

new technologies or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks or changes in a wireless service provider customer’s business model may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure in addition as customers deploy increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our wireless service provider customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies and architectures  such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site cellular architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure further a customer may decide to no longer outsource wireless infrastructure or otherwise change its business model any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures or changes in a customer’s business model may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 

﻿ 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in us dollars in brazil canada chile and colombia significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are dominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into us dollars at average exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2017  approximately   186 of our total cash site leasin g revenue was generated by our i nternational operations of which 136 was generated in nonu  s  dollar currencies including 127 which was denominat ed in brazilian rea is  the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility a nd strengthen ed 87 when comparing the average rate for the years ended   december 31 2017 and 2016  this trend has affected and may in the future continue to affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the us   d ollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

furthermore we have intercompany loan agreement s which permit one of our brazilian entities to borrow amounts up to  1250 m illion  as of december 31 2017  the aggre gate outstanding balance under these agreement s was 5609 million in accordance with 

 

asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future  consequently if the us dollar strengthen s against the brazilian real our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2017 and 2016  we recorded a   88 million loss and a   900 million   gain  respectively    on the remeasurement of the intercompany loan due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers to the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers if i these records are not complete or accurate ii we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers or iii the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as i an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the projected financial results ii unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period iii increased demands on our cash resources that may among other things impact our ability to explore other opportunities iv undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover v increased vulnerability to general economic conditions vi an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships vii additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and viii diversion of managerial attention 

the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business it may also result in the loss of key customers andor personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers 

  delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g including longterm evolution “lte” advanced wireless service in the 16951710 mhz 17551780 mhz and 21552180 mhz bands the “aws3” bands or other new wireless technologies such as 5g will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g in the united states experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and continued deployment of 4g could experience delays additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated particularly in certain of our international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 2014 senior notes  the 2016 senior notes  and the 2017 senior notes  the senior credit agreement and the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each in strument limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 65 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account in stead of being released to the b orrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the b orrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes  and 2017 senior notes and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases  we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

• the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures 

• the size and scope of our projects 

• the business practices of customers such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year 

 

• delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment 

• seasonal factors such as weather holidays and vacation days and total business days in a quarter 

• the use of third party providers by our customers 

• the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development and 

• general economic conditions 

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in dem and for our site development services 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us in our international operations the impact of these zoning permitting and related regula tions and restrictive covenants on our new builds colocations and operations could be exacerbated as some of these markets may lack established permitting processes for towers have inconsistencies between national and local regulations and have other barriers to timely construction and permitting of towers as a result tower construction in some of our international markets may be delayed or halted or our acquired towers may not perform as anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

a s part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems  or those of our cloud or internetbased providers could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our or our vendors’ computer systems and backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters and other unforeseen events   

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes or may collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies  we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and may harm our reputation  

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we may be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols generated prior to the 2018 tax year can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire nols generated starting in the 2018 tax year can be carried forward indefinitely but are subject to the 80 utilization limitation we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations if our tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties  or make additional distributions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

the recently adopted us tax legislation may result in additional tax liabilities that may affect our future results and profitability 

on december 22 2017 the us government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the tax cuts and jobs act the “tax act” that significantly revises the us tax code by among other things lowering the corporate income tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat 21 imposing a mandatory onetime deemed repatriation of foreign earnings commonly referred to as the “transition tax” limiting deductibility of interest expense and certain executive compensation and implemen ting a territorial tax system 

the sec staff acknowledged the challenges companies face incorporating the effects of the tax act by their financial reporting deadlines in response staff accounting bulletin no 118 “sab 118” was issued on december 22 2017 regarding application of financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic 740 income taxes “asc topic 740” specifically to the tax act sab 118 addresses the application of us gaap in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available prepared or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete accounting for certain income tax effects of the tax act 

the tax act impacted our consolidated results of operations during the fourth quarter and may impact our consolidated results of operations in future periods in particular the transition tax resulted in a onetime income inclusion of 524 million related to previously unremitted earnings of certain nonus subsidiaries which we will elect to include in income over the next eight tax years the inclusion will be offset by our existing nols to the extent possible during the eightyear recognition period in addition we recorded a onetime reduction to our deferred tax asset and offsetting valuation allowance i n the amount of 315 million 192 million related to the reduction of the us corporate tax rate and 123 million related to the new limitations on the deductibility of executive compensation these amounts represent our provisional estimate of the relevant charges but will be subject to adjustment as we finalize the relevant computations and as additional irs rules and guidance on the tax act provisions are adopted since the tax act was passed late in the fourth quarter of 2017 and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation are expected over the next 12 months we consider the accounting of the transition tax gilti section 162m adjustment state taxes and other items to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis of final yearend data and tax positions we expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with sab 118 any material revisions in our computations could adversely affect our results of operations in future periods 

in addition many of the provisions of the tax act will require guidance through the issuance of treasury regulations in order to assess their effect there may be a substantial delay before such regulations are promulgated increasing the uncertainty as to the ultimate effect of the statutory amendments on us future regulatory or administrative guidance may also have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders 

 

risks related to our status as a reit 

﻿ 

complying with the reit requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities 

﻿ 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders for example to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary “ trs” generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 25 for taxable years beginning on or before december 31 2017 or 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate assets 

﻿ 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify and be subject to tax as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing nols to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code these distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities furthermore our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements these actions could have the effect of reducing our income amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness 

﻿ 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

﻿ 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis 

﻿ 

we received an opinion of our special reit tax counsel with respect to our qualification as a reit investors should be aware however that opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or any court the opinion represents only the view of such counsel based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income the opinion is expressed as of the date issued our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 

﻿ 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced 

 

﻿ 

we may be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

﻿ 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage decrease our adjusted funds from operations per share or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases 

﻿ 

thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore compliance with the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which wou ld increase our total leverage   

﻿ 

covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required reit distributions 

﻿ 

the senior credit agreement the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2014 senior notes  2016 senior notes  and 2017 senior notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders under the senior credit agreement our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our reit distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100 of our reit taxable income so long as sba senior finance ii’s ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda does not exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter in addition under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions or securitization a failure to comply with the debt service coverage ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us finally while the indentures governing the 2014 senior notes  2016 senior notes  and 2017 senior notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a reit or to avoid entity level taxation this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2014 senior notes  2016 senior notes  or 2017 senior notes  as applicable have not otherwise been accelerated 

﻿ 

if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our reit taxable income we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax and potentially the nondeductible 4 excise tax on the retained amounts 

﻿ 

our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

reits are required to distribute annually at least 90 of their reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain a s of december 31 2017  9567 m illion of the federal nols are attributes of the reit we may   use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized the internal revenue code places limitations upon the future availability of nols based upon changes in our equity if these occur our ability to offset future income with existing nols may be limited we currently expect that we will utilize available nols to reduce all or a portion of our reit taxable income and therefore we may not initially make any distributions which may adversely affect the market value of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by the board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by the board of directors and will depend on among other factors our nols our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds consequently our future distribution levels may fluctuate 

﻿ 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which would reduce our cash flows and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

﻿ 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit in addition we may incur a 100 

 

excise tax on transactions with a trs if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

﻿ 

our trs assets and operations also will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located if we continue our international expansion we may have additional trs assets and operations subject to such taxes any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

﻿ 

we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate 35 in 2017 and 21 as of january 1 2018  on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring during our first five years as a reit up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2016 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis in those assets as of january 1 2016 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability we cannot however assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 

﻿ 

our use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

﻿ 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to represent more than 25 of the fair market value of our assets or causes the fair market value of our trs securities alone to represent more than 25 for taxable years beginning on or before december 31 2017 or 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit if we continue our international expansion we may have increased net income from trss which may cause us to rise above these thresholds 

﻿ 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

﻿ 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification 

﻿ 

our board’s ability to revoke our reit qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders 

﻿ 

our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our shareholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders if any in computing our taxable income and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders 

﻿ 

we have limited experience operating as a reit which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

﻿ 

we have limited experience operating as a reit and as a result we may not be able to operate successfully as a reit in addition we will be required to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a reit as a result we may incur additional legal accounting and other expenses that we have not previously incurred which could be significant and our management and other personnel may need to devote additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the code these costs and time commitments could be substantially more than we currently expect therefore our historical combined consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future costs and performance as a reit if our performance is adversely affected it could affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 

﻿ 

the historical market price of our class a common stock prior to our reit conversion may not be indicative of the market price of our cl ass a common stock following our reit conversion 

﻿ 

the historical market price of our class a common stock prior to our reit conversion which commenced with our taxable year ending december 31 2016 may not be indicative of how the market values our class a common stock following our reit 

 

conversion because of the change in our organization from a taxable c corporation to a reit although we do not currently anticipate commencing distributions until a future date the stock price of reit securities have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates as investors evaluate the annual yield from distributions on the entity’s common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments in addition the market price of our class a common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of reit securities as well as general market conditions 

﻿ 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

﻿ 

the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent our shareholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 

in order for us to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification no more than 50 in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax as a reit has been made in addition our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made our articles of incorporation contain reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits these ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 







 item 2 properties 

we own our headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently have approximately 160000 square feet of office space we also own or have entered into longterm leases for international and regional locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities and in certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of december 31 2017  approximately 70 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is   33 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more 

most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas we measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located as of december 31 2017  we had an average of 17 tenants per tower structure

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america as of december 31 2017  1  no us state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total tower portfolio by tower count and  2 no u s state or territory accounted for more than 10 of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2017  in addition as of december 31 2017  approximately 301 of our total towers are located in brazil and less than 3 of our total towers are located in any of our other international markets each country is considered a market we derive s ite leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att tmobile verizon wireless sprint oi sa telefonica claro and tim wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods   at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying ground lease rent 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3  taxes in brazil  canada  chile and colombia  significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency in argentina and peru our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in a mix of local currency and us dollars 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• straightline rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• deferred lease origination cost amortization 

ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in our south american markets adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2017  approximately 70 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of property taxes varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

﻿ 



﻿ 

we believe that the site leasing business continues to be attractive due to its longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn   which refers to when a cus tomer does not renew its lease or cancels its lease prior to the end of its term other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology  we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements during 2018  we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to increase over   2017 levels due in part to wireless carriers deploying unused spectrum and spectrum acquired during auctions completed in 2017 we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology eg iden  metropcs clearwire and cricket   

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations

capital allocation strategy 

our capital allocation strategy is to prioritize investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value a primary goal of our capital allocation strategy is to increase our adjusted funds from operations per share to achieve this we expect we would continue to deploy capital between portfolio growth and stock repurchases subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements available funds and market conditions while maintaining our target leverage levels key elements of our capital allocation strategy include 

portfolio growth  we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers 

stock r epurcha se p rogram  we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below intrinsic value we believe that share repurchases when purchased at the right price will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2017  included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable 

asset impairment 

we evaluate individual longlived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment 

we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value we record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include but are not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 

acquisitions 

﻿ 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 clarifying the definition of a business asu 201701 provides revised guidance to determine when an acquisition meets the definition of a business or when the acquisition should be accounted for as an asset acquisition we adopted this standard effective january 1 2017 and all changes will be accounted for prospectively the adoption of asu 201701 did not have a material impact on our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 

﻿ 

under the new standard our acquisitions will generally qualify for asset acquisition treatment under asc 360 property plant and equipment rather than business combination treatment under asc 805 business combinations for acquisitions which qualify as asset acquisitions the aggregate purchase price is allocated on a relative fair value basis to towers and related intangible assets for asset acquisitions external direct transaction costs will be capitalized as a component of the cost of the asset acquired we will continue to expense internal acquisition costs as incurred 

﻿ 

we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities acquired are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with those from the dates of the respective acquisitions we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date 

  

the fair values of net assets acquired are based on management’s estimates and assumptions as well as other information compiled by management including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques the fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management at the time if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could be subject to a possible impairment of the intangible assets or require acceleration of the amortization expense of intangible assets in subsequent periods 

  

the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date “current contract intangibles” and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the towers “network location intangibles” and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related tower assets which is typically 15 years 

﻿ 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to pay contingent consideration or earnouts in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired contingent consideration in connection with asset acquisitions will be recognized at the time when the contingency is resolved or becomes payable and will increase the cost basis of the assets acquired we accrue for contingent 

 

consideration in connection with business combinations at fair value as of the date of the acquisition all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration payable in cash are recorded through consolidated statements of operations 

 

results of operations 

this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding a nongaap measure adjusted ebitda we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016 we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period as well as by eliminating the impact of the remeasurement of our intercompany loans in addition we believe that excluding the oi reserve which represents a 165 million onetime provision for do ubtful accounts recorded in the prior year  provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a nonrecurring event 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits in addition adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures re lating to the 2014 senior notes 2016 senior notes and 2017 senior notes adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance

in canada  our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods in central america we have similar fixed rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index in brazil tenant leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site tenant leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a passthrough charge for the underlying ground lease rent our ground leases in canada central america and south america generally have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states except that the annual escalators in our south american ground leases are based on a cost of living index   our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in united states dollars while our operations in canada and the remainder of south america are denominated in local currencies 

domestic and international expansion 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks ii increased consumer mobile data traffic such as media streaming mobile apps and games web browsing and email and iii incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments since we first entered the central and south american markets we have built or acquired 10003 towers as of december 31 2016   and continue to expand in these markets to respond to growing demand 

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 







in our new build program we construct tower structures 1 in locations that are strategically chosen by us or 2 under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will n eed to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants 

 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure  4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market  and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video the deployment of additional spectrum and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of towers that they utilize and additions or changes to the equipment they deploy at existing towers we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 









we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into st eady leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn   which refers to when a customer does not renew its lease or in very limited circumstances such as in a customer bankruptcy cancels its lease prior to the end of its term other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessation of a particular technology eg iden  the longterm and repetitive nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we measure the available 

 

capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2016  we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio    we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable  consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries we believe that our industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2016  approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 33 years as of december 31 2016  approximately 62 of our tower structures ha d ground leases maturing in the next 10 years 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regiona l local or private operators internationally we service all the major service providers in canada central america and south america 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 





we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers american tower and crown castle have significantly more towers than we do which could provide them a competitive advantage in negotiating with wireless service providers furthermore these entities generally have greater financial resources than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage in connection with the acquisition of material tower portfolios however we believe that tower location and capacity have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business other competitive factors are quality of service to our tenants and price 

international site leasing – our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks large national and regional independent tower companies  and alternative facilities such as rooftop outdoor and indoor das networks billboards utility poles and electric transmission towers  

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

 

employees 

our corporate offices are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida we also have employees located in our international regional and local offices as of december 31 2016  we had 1241 employees of which 253 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 828 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2016  both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations which were amended in 2014 govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its princip als are subject to a denial of f ederal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and 

 

operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2016  we had 955 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 87 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2015  we had 697 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 66 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed under executed contracts as of december 31 2016  we had approximately 260 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 307 million as of december 31 2015

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results  ability to service our indebtedness  and stock price could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar  or acquired technologies may be discontinued  in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint the combined companies have rationalized duplicative parts of their networks and in the case of sprint the nextel iden network was discontinued which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers during 2013 sprint acquired clearwire communications and tmobile acquired metropcs and in 2014 att acquired leap wireless cricket wireless th ese consolidation s have led and may also lead to additional nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us th ese consolidation s could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results   and our ability to service our indebtedness these risks could be exacerbated due to changes in governmental policy that may favor industry consolidation  

in addition the market price of our class a common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of the announcement or consummation of wireless service provider customer consolidations and their impact on our future operating results 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our deficit the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2016 and 2015  

﻿ 



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage for example on july 7 2016  we through a new york common law trust issued  7 000 million aggregate principal amount of tower securities  and on august 15 2016 we issued 11 billion of unsecured senior notes  

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including share repurchases tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures  or to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions  share repurchases or other opportunities and to satisfy our reit distribution requirements  

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates or changes in central bank monetary policy may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur pursuant to our revolving credit facility and term loans and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

on june 20 2016 oi sa “oi” our largest customer in brazil filed a petition for judicial reorganization in brazil for the year ended december 31 2016  oi comprised approximately 75 of our total site leasing revenue due to the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of amounts owed by oi prior to the date of oi’s petition we recorded a 165 million bad debt provision during the second quarter of 2016 relating to amounts owed or potentially owed by oi as of the petition date while we continue to do business with oi under our contracts in the ordinary course and oi has stated its intentions to continue normal operations during its judicial reorganization we cannot assure you that oi will continue to be willing or able to continue to make payments to us in accordance with the terms of our contracts judicial reorganization in brazil requires the agreement of certain creditors for which there can be no assurance if oi is unable to successfully reorganize it may be forced to liquidate if oi is unable or unwilling to reorganize in a manner that continues to provide us anticipated payments in accordance with our contracts it could materially decrease our revenues and adversely affect our financial condition 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time period s derived from these customers 

﻿ 



﻿ 

 

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

﻿

﻿ 

﻿ 

1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of att wireless and leap wireless cricket wireless 

﻿ 

we derive revenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the us and canada and renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant site leasing contracts in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

﻿ 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have business operations in canada central america and south america our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in united states d ollars while our operations in canada and the remainder of south america are denominated in local currencies our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into united states dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2016  approximately   163 of our total cash site leasin g revenue was generated by our i nternational operations of which 116 was generated in nonu  s  dollar currencies including 108 which was denominat ed in brazilian rea l  the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated significantly recently and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility and weaken ed 55 when comparing the average r ate for the years ended   december 31 2016 and 2015  this trend has affected and may in the future continue to affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the united states d ollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

 

furthermore we have an intercompany loan agreement which permits one of our brazilian entities to borrow amounts up to 7500 million as of december 31 2016  the outstanding balance under this agreement was 4333 million  in accordance with asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations as settlement is anticipated or planned in the foreseeable future  consequently if the us dollar strengthen s against the brazilian real our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2016 and 2015  we recorded a   900 million gain and a   1789 million loss respectively    on remeasurement of the intercompany loan due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to the land under our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all in addition the land underlying the 2113 towers we acquired in 2013 from oi one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers is subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government will have the right to i renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or ii terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land although oi has entered into a nonterminable lease with us for 35 years if the concession is not renewed our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease for the year ended december 31 2016  we generated 120 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers of which 74 related to oi and 46 represented revenue from colocated tenants 

as of december 31 2016  the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was approximately 33 years and approximately 62 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of ope rations or financial condition 

new technologies or network architecture or changes in a customer’s business model may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks or changes in a wireless service provider customer’s business model may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure in addition as customers deploy increased capital to the development and implementation of new technologies they may allocate less of their budgets to lease space on our towers for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our wireless service provider customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies and architectures  such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site cellular architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure further a customer may decide to no longer outsource wireless infrastructure or otherwise change its business model any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures or changes in a customer’s business model may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us  

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available in the us and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers for example in 2016 we passed on more us acquisitions than we did in 2015 due to asset quality price or lease terms furthermore  to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do finally competition regulations domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios or apply to us differently than they apply to our competitors as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be 

 

able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

o ur ability to build new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds domestically and internationally than anticipated the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2017  if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada central america and south america and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were approximately   162 during the year ended december 31 2016  and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership 

• laws effecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel and 

• language and cultural differences 

 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues and we cannot control that demand 

additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks if consumers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers c ould experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service provider customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless service provide rs may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers to the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers if i these records are not complete or accurate ii we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers or iii the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as i an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the projected financial results ii unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period iii increased demands on our cash resources that may among other things impact our ability to explore other opportunities iv undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover v increased vulnerability to general economic conditions vi an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships vii additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and viii diversion of managerial attention 

the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business it may also result in the loss of key customers andor personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers 

  delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g including longterm evolution “lte” advanced wireless service in the 16951710 mhz 17551780 mhz and 21552180 mhz bands the “aws3” bands or other new wireless technologies such as 5g will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g in the united states experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and continued deployment of 4g could experience delays additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated particularly in certain of our international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our wireless service provider customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow colocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies have been and based on recent consolidations continue to be substantially larger and have greater 

 

financial resources than we do this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 2014 senior notes and the 2016 senior notes  the senior credit agreement and the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each in strument limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 65 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account in stead of being released to the 

 

b orrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the b orrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under the revolving credit facility and term loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease there is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk we currently have no interest rate swaps 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 2014 senior notes and 2016 senior notes and funds to be utilized for stock repurchases  we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

• the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures 

• the size and scope of our projects 

• the business practices of customers such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year 

• delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment 

• seasonal factors such as weather holidays and vacation days and total business days in a quarter 

• the use of third party providers by our customers 

 

• the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development and 

• general economic conditions 

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in dem and for our site development services 

we have not traditionally been profitable and may incur losses in the future 

in 2016 we were profitable however in 2015 and 2014 we were not profitable the following chart shows the net income losses we incurred for the periods indicated   

﻿ 



﻿ 

during 2015 and 2014 our losses we re principally due to depreciation amortization  and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt  in addition in 2015 our loss included remeasurement losses related to a foreign currency denominated intercompany loan 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations 

 

may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

a part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters and other unforeseen events  

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes or may collapse for any number of reasons including structural deficiencies  we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition and may harm our reputation  

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we may be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations if our tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or penalties or make additional distributions which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols and could result in us having to make additional cash distributions 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

risks related to our status as a reit 

﻿ 

complying with the reit requirements may cause us to liquidate assets or hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities 

﻿ 

to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes we must continually satisfy tests concerning among other things the nature and diversification of our assets the sources of our income and the amounts we distribute to our shareholders for example to qualify as a reit we must ensure that at the end of each calendar quarter at least 75 of the value of our assets consists of cash cash items government securities and “real estate assets” as defined in the code including towers and certain mortgage loans and securities the remainder of our investments other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a taxable reit subsidiary “ trs” generally cannot include more than 10 of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer or more than 10 of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer in addition in general no more than 5 of the value of our total assets other than government securities qualified real estate assets and securities issued by a trs can consist of the securities of any one issuer and no more than 25 for taxable years beginning on or before december 31 2017 or 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trss if we fail to comply with these requirements at the end of any calendar quarter we must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our reit qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences as a result we may be required to liquidate assets 

﻿ 

in addition to the asset tests set forth above to qualify and be subject to tax as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders our determination as to the timing or amount of future dividends will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business and the availability of our existing nols to the extent that we satisfy the 90 distribution requirement but distribute less than 100 of our reit taxable income after the application of available nols if any we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income in addition we will be subject to a 4 nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our shareholders for a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under the code these distribution requirements could hinder our ability to pursue otherwise attractive asset acquisition opportunities furthermore our ability to compete for acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with certain reit requirements these actions could have the effect of reducing our income amounts available for distribution to our shareholders and amounts available for making payments on our indebtedness 

﻿ 

 

qualifying as a reit involves highly technical and complex provisions of the code if we fail to qualify as a reit or fail to remain qualified as a reit to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax as a regular corporation and could face a substantial tax liability which would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders 

﻿ 

qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex code provisions for which only limited judicial and administrative authorities exist even a technical or inadvertent violation could jeopardize our reit qualification our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis 

﻿ 

our board of directors has authorized us to take all necessary steps for sbac to be subject to tax as a reit for us federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ending december 31 2016 we received an opinion of our special reit tax counsel with respect to our qualification as a reit investors should be aware however that opinions of counsel are not binding on the irs or any court the opinion represents only the view of such counsel based on its review and analysis of existing law and on certain representations as to factual matters and covenants made by us including representations relating to the values of our assets and the sources of our income the opinion is expressed as of the date issued our qualification as a reit will depend on our satisfaction of certain asset income organizational distribution shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends upon our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals 

﻿ 

if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year to the extent we have reit taxable income and have utilized our nols we would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and dividends paid to our shareholders would not be deductible by us in computing our taxable income any resulting corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders which in turn could have an adverse impact on the value of our common stock unless we were entitled to relief under certain provisions of the code we also would be disqualified from reelecting to be taxed as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate assets to pay any additional tax liability accordingly funds available for investment and making payments on our indebtedness would be reduced 

﻿ 

we may be required to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity to satisfy our reit distribution requirements 

﻿ 

from time to time we may generate reit taxable income greater than our cash flow as a result of differences in timing between the recognition of taxable income and the actual receipt of cash or the effect of nondeductible capital expenditures the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments if we do not have other funds available in these situations we may need to borrow funds sell assets or raise equity even if the thenprevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings sales or offerings to enable us to satisfy the reit distribution requirement and to avoid us federal corporate income tax and the 4 excise tax in a particular year these alternatives could increase our costs and our leverage decrease our adjusted funds from operations per share or require us to distribute amounts that would otherwise be invested in future acquisitions or stock repurchases 

﻿ 

thus compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to grow which could adversely affect the value of our common stock furthermore compliance with the reit distribution requirements may increase the financing we need to fund capital expenditures future growth or expansion initiatives which wou ld increase our total leverage   

﻿ 

covenants specified in our current and future debt instruments may limit our ability to make required reit distributions 

﻿ 

the senior credit agreement the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions and the indentures governing our 2014 senior notes and 2016 senior notes contain certain covenants that could limit our ability to make distributions to our shareholders under the senior credit agreement our subsidiaries may make distributions to us to satisfy our reit distribution requirements and additional amounts to distribute up to 100 of our reit taxable income so long as sba senior finance ii’s ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda does not exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter in addition under the mortgage loan agreement related to our securitization transactions or securitization a failure to comply with the debt service coverage ratio in that agreement could prevent our borrower subsidiaries from distributing any excess cash from the operation of their towers to us finally while the indentures governing the 2014 senior notes and the 2016 senior notes permit us to make distributions to our shareholders to the extent such distributions are necessary to maintain our status as a reit or to avoid entity level taxation this authority is subject to the conditions that no default or event of default exists or would result therefrom and that the obligations under the 2014 senior notes or the 2016 senior notes as applicable have not otherwise been accelerated 

﻿ 

if these limits prevent us from satisfying our reit distribution requirements we could fail to qualify for taxation as a reit if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a reit but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100 of our 

 

reit taxable income we will be subject to us federal corporate income tax and potentially the nondeductible 4 excise tax on the retained amounts 

﻿ 

our payment of cash distributions in the future is not guaranteed and the amount of any future cash distributions may fluctuate which could adversely affect the value of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

reits are required to distribute annually at least 90 of their reit taxable income determined before the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any net capital gain a s of december 31 2016  11 billion of the federal nols are attributes of the reit we may   use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized the internal revenue code places limitations upon the future availability of nols based upon changes in our equity if these occur our ability to offset future income with existing nols may be limited we currently expect that we will utilize available nols to reduce all or a portion of our reit taxable income and therefore we may not initially make any distributions which may adversely affect the market value of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

the amount of future distributions will be determined from time to time by the board of directors to balance our goal of increasing longterm shareholder value and retaining sufficient cash to implement our current capital allocation policy which prioritizes investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value the actual timing and amount of distributions will be as determined and declared by the board of directors and will depend on among other factors our nols our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds consequently our future distribution levels may fluctuate 

﻿ 

certain of our business activities may be subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes which would reduce our cash flows and would have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities 

﻿ 

we may be subject to certain federal state local and foreign taxes on our income and assets including alternative minimum taxes taxes on any undistributed income and state local or foreign income franchise property and transfer taxes in addition we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax which could be significant in amount in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the code to maintain qualification for taxation as a reit in addition we may incur a 100 excise tax on transactions with a trs if they are not conducted on an arm’s length basis any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash 

﻿ 

our trs assets and operations also will continue to be subject as applicable to federal and state corporate income taxes and to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those assets and operations are located any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash we will also be subject to a federal corporate level tax at the highest regular corporate rate currently 35 on the gain recognized from a sale of assets occurring during our first five years as a reit up to the amount of the builtin gain that existed on january 1 2016 which is based on the fair market value of those assets in excess of our tax basis in those assets as of january 1 2016 gain from a sale of an asset occurring after the specified period ends will not be subject to this corporate level tax we currently do not expect to sell any asset if the sale would result in the imposition of a material tax liability we cannot however assure you that we will not change our plans in this regard 

﻿ 

our use of trss may cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 

﻿ 

the net income of our trss is not required to be distributed to us and such undistributed trs income is generally not subject to our reit distribution requirements however if the accumulation of cash or reinvestment of significant earnings in our trss causes the fair market value of our securities in those entities taken together with other nonqualifying assets to represent more than 25 of the fair market value of our assets or causes the fair market value of our trs securities alone to represent more than 25 for taxable years beginning on or before december 31 2017 or 20 for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 of the value of our total assets in each case as determined for reit asset testing purposes we would absent timely responsive action fail to qualify as a reit 

﻿ 

legislative or other actions affecting reits could have a negative effect on us 

﻿ 

the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the irs and the treasury changes to the tax laws or interpretations thereof with or without retroactive application could materially and adversely affect our investors or us we cannot predict how changes in the tax laws might affect our investors or us new legislation us treasury regulations administrative interpretations or court decisions could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a reit or the us federal income tax consequences to our investors and us of such qualification 

﻿ 

 

our board’s ability to revoke our reit qualification without shareholder approval may cause adverse consequences to our shareholders 

﻿ 

our articles of incorporation provide that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election without the approval of our shareholders if it determines that it is no longer in our best interests to continue to qualify as a reit if we cease to be a reit we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders if any in computing our taxable income and to the extent we have taxable income and have utilized our nols we will be subject to us federal income tax at regular corporate rates and state and local taxes which may have adverse consequences on our total return to our shareholders 

﻿ 

we do not have any experience operating as a reit which may adversely affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow per share trading price of our common stock and ability to satisfy debt service obligations 

﻿ 

while we believe that we are currently operating in a manner that complies with the reit rules we have not actually operated as a reit previously our prereit operating experience may not be sufficient to enable us to operate successfully as a reit in addition we will be required to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to maintain our status as a reit as a result we may incur additional legal accounting and other expenses that we have not previously incurred which could be significant and our management and other personnel may need to devote additional time to comply with these rules and regulations and controls required for continued compliance with the code these costs and time commitments could be substantially more than we currently expect therefore our historical combined consolidated financial statements may not be indicative of our future costs and performance as a reit if our performance is adversely affected it could affect our financial condition results of operations cash flow and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations

the historical market price of our class a common stock may not be indicative of the market price of our class a common stock following the reit conversion  

﻿ 

the historical market price of our class a common stock may not be indicative of how the market value s our class a common stock following our reit conversion because of the change in our organization from a taxable c corporation to a reit although we do not currently anticipate commencing distributions until a future date the stock price of reit securities have historically been affected by changes in market interest rates as investors evaluate the annual yield from distributions on the entity’s common stock as compared to yields on other financial instruments in addition the market price of our class a common stock may be affected by the economic and market perception of reit securities as well as general market conditions  

﻿ 

as a reit we are no longer eligible to be included in the nasdaq 100 index  t herefore those index funds that invest in the equity of nasdaq 100 companies will be required to sell our shares and not purchase them in the future which could have an adverse effect on the volatility and market price of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

one of the eligibility criteria for the nasdaq 100 index is that the company is not a financial company as a reit we are considered a financial company even though our business model has not change d in connection with the reit conversion and therefore we are no longer eligible to be included in the nasdaq 100 index as a result those index funds that invest in nasdaq 100 companies will be required to sell shares of our class a common stock and not purchase them in the future in addition other nonindex funds that use inclusion on the nasdaq 100 index as a component of their investment criteria may be required to sell and no longer invest in our class a common stock we do not know how many shares of our class a common stock are held by these index and nonindex funds the sales of significant amounts of shares of our class a common stock or the perception in the market that this will occur could have an adverse effect on the volatility and market price of our class a common stock 

﻿ 

dividends payable by reits do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends 

﻿ 

the maximum us federal income tax rate applicable to income from “qualified dividends” payable to us shareholders that are individuals trusts and estates is currently 20 dividends payable by reits however generally are not eligible for the reduced rates applicable to qualified dividends although these rules do not adversely affect the taxation of reits the more favorable rates applicable to regular corporate qualified dividends could cause investors who are individuals trusts and estates to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of nonreit corporations that pay dividends which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits including our common stock 

 

risks related to ownership of our class a common stock 

the reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions may restrict or prevent you from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock 

in order for us to satisfy the requirements for reit qualification no more than 50 in value of all classes or series of our outstanding shares of stock may be owned beneficially or constructively by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be subject to tax as a reit has been made in addition our capital stock must be beneficially owned by 100 or more persons during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year other than the first year for which an election to be taxed as a reit has been made our articles of incorporation contain reitrelated ownership and transfer restrictions that generally restrict shareholders from owning more than 98 by value or number of shares whichever is more restrictive of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or 98 in aggregate value of the outstanding shares of all classes and series of our capital stock under applicable constructive ownership rules any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the ownership limits these ownership and transfer restrictions could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our capital stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our shareholders 

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 







 item 2 properties 

we own our headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently have approximately 160000 square feet of office space we have entered into longterm leases for international and regional locations convenient for the management and operation of our site leasing activities and in certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of december 31 2016  approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control is   33 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more 

most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas we measure the available capacity of our existing facilities to support additional tenants and generate additional lease revenue by assessing several factors including tower height tower type wind loading environmental conditions existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located as of december 31 2016  we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications infrastructure including tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america and canada our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 987 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2016  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2016  we owned 26197 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 5500 actual or potential towers approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2016  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

 

reit conversion 

in october 2016 we announced our intention to take the necessary steps to qualify as a reit for us federal income tax purposes we refer to this as the reit conversion we believe that our business has been operated in a manner that complies with the reit rules since january 1 2016 and as a result we intend to make the election to be subject to tax as a reit commencing with our taxable year ending december 31 2016 because we believe our business is currently operated in a manner that complies with the reit rules no further reorganization of our operations is necessary to complete the reit conversion 

as part of the reit conversion effective january 1 3  2017 we completed the merger with our predecessor that was approved by our shareholders at a special meeting held o n january 12 2017 and as a result of the merger we now hold directly or indirectly through our subsidiaries the assets held by our predecessor prior to the merger and conduct the existing businesses of our predecessor and its subsidiaries at the effective time of the merger all outstanding shares of class a common stock of our predecessor were converted into a right to receive an equal number of our shares of class a common stock although the reit rules do not require the completion of this merger we completed the merger to facilitate our compliance with the reit rules by ensuring the effective adoption of certain reitrelated ownership limitations and transfer restrictions related to our capital stock 

a reit is a corporation that qualifies for special treatment for us federal income tax purposes because among other things it derives most of its income from real estatebased sources and makes a special election under the code we operate as a reit that principally invests in and derives most of its income from the ownership operation and leasing of towers as a reit we generally will be entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore not subject to us federal corporate income tax on that portion of our net income that we distribute to our shareholders however we will continue to pay us federal income tax on earnings if any from assets and operations held through trss these assets and operations currently consist primarily of our site development services and our international operations our international operations will continue to be subject as applicable to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which those operations are located we may also be subject to a variety of taxes including payroll taxes and state local and foreign income property and other taxes on our assets and operations 

as a reit we will generally be required to distribute at least 90 of our reit taxable income after the utilization of any available nols determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain each year to our shareholders in addition to the reit distribution requirements our determination as to the timing and amount of future dividend distributions will be based on a number of factors including investment opportunities around our core business the availability of our existing federal nols of approximately 11 billion as of december 31 2016   that are attributes of the reit our financial condition earnings debt covenants and other possible uses of such funds we may use these nols to offset our reit taxable income and thus any required distributions to shareholders may be reduced or eliminated until such time as the nols have been fully utilized we do not expect that we will be required to make any distribution of accumulated earnings and profits commonly referred to as a “purging” dividend in connection with our reit conversion 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile verizon wireless oi sa telefonica claro and tim  wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index site leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a pass through charge for the underlying ground lease rent 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in our brazilian canadian and chilean operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency 

 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• straightline rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• deferred lease origination cost amortization 

ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually or in our south american markets adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2016  approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

﻿ 



﻿ 

we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements during 2017  we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to be consistent with our growth in 2016  we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of a specific technology eg iden  

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to 

 

wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas on existing infrastructure 4 support in leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others on a local basis through regional market and project offices the market offices are responsible for all site development operations   

for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

capital allocation strategy 

our capital allocation strategy is to prioritize investment in quality assets that meet our return criteria and then stock repurchases when we believe our stock price is below its intrinsic value a primary goal of our capital allocation strategy is to increase our adjusted funds from operations per share to achieve this we expect we would continue to deploy capital between portfolio growth and stock repurchases subject to compliance with reit distribution requirements available funds and market conditions while maintaining our target leverage levels key elements of our capital allocation strategy include 

portfolio growth  we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers 

stock repurchase program  we currently utilize stock repurchases as part of our capital allocation policy when we believe our share price is below intrinsic value after portfolio growth we believe that share repurchases when purchased at the right price will facilitate our goal of increasing our adjusted funds from operations per share 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2016  included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because 

 

management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable 

asset impairment 

we evaluate individual longlived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment 

we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value we record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include but are not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date “current contract intangibles” and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites “network location intangibles” and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets which is typically 15 years 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to pay contingent consideration or earnouts in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired we accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through consolidated statements of operations 

in september 2015 the fasb issued asu 201516 business combinations the standard requires that the acquirer 1 recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined 2 record in the same period’s financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation amortization or other income effects if any as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and 3 to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date we adopted asu 201516 effective january 1 2016 the financial statement impact of adopting this standard was not material for all periods presented 

 

in january 2017 the fasb issued asu 201701 clarifying the definition of a business the standard provides guidance to help entities determine whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses the standard is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december 15 2018 and early adoption is permitted the standard is required to be applied prospectively we are evaluating the standard including the impact on its consolidated financial statements  

results of operations 

this report presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year period

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding a nongaap measure adjusted ebitda we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure this report also presents our financial results and other financial metrics after eliminating the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the oi reserve recorded in the second quarter of 2016 we believe that providing these financial results and metrics on a constant currency basis which are nongaap measures gives management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of our business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we eliminate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates by dividing the current period’s financial results by the average monthly exchange rates of the prior year we believe that excluding the oi reserve which represents a 165 million onetime bad debt provision for all amounts owed or potentially owed by oi prior to the date of oi’s june 2016 petition for judicial reorganization provides management and investors the ability to better analyze our core results without the impact of what we believe is a nonrecurring event 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related adjustments and expenses asset impairment and decommission costs interest income interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization and provision for or benefit from taxes 

﻿ 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is useful to investors or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance adjusted ebitda is the primary measure used by management 1 to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and 2 for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to and assessing the performance of our operations management believes that adjusted ebitda helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations 1 from period to period and 2 to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt and asset base primarily depreciation amortization and accretion from our financial results management also believes adjusted ebitda is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of reits in addition adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to the 2014 senior notes and 2016 senior notes defined below adjusted ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance

 item 1 business   

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america and canada  our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 968 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2015  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2015  we owned 25465 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 5500 actual or potential towers approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2015  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america  we receive s ite leasing revenues primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile verizon wireless oi sa telefonica claro and digicel wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site  our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 962 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years o ur site leasing business is classified into two reportable segments domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2015  we had 15778 sites in the united states for the year ended december 31 2015  we generated 835 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites we receive d omestic site leasing revenues primarily from att sprint verizon wireless and tmobile in the united states wireless service providers typically enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower our tenant leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which typically average 3 4  per year  for both the initial and renewal option periods  our ground leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of 5year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2  3  annually 

international site leasing 

in 2015  we continued to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments as of december 31 2015  we owned 9687 towers in our international markets including brazil canada costa rica ecuador el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama we receive i nternational site leasing revenues primarily from oi sa telefonica claro digicel and tim our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to continue to expand operations through new builds and acquisitions 

our tenant leases in canada typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states with an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year tenant leases in our central america n and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index in brazil site leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site s ite leases in south america typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a passthrough charge for the underlying ground lease rent our ground leases in canada central america and south america generally have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states except that the annual escalator s in our south america n ground leases are based on a cost of living index 

 

domestic and international expansion 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks ii increased consumer mobile data traffic  such as media streaming mobile apps and games web browsing and email  and iii incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments since we first entered the central and south american markets  we have built or acquired 9430 towers and continue to expand in these markets to respond to growing demand 

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 







in our new build program we construct tower structures 1 in locations that a re strategically chosen by us or 2 under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified under these arrangements we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants during 2016  we intend to build between 590 and 610 new tower structures domestically and internationally 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our towers we earn s ite development services revenues primarily from the full range of end to end services we provide to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services on a local basis through regional territory and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video the deployment of additional spectrum and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of towers that they u tilize and additions and changes to the equipment they deploy at existing towers we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 









we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm and repetitive nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2015  we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio    we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses during 2016  we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries we believe that our 

 

i ndustry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2015  approximately 73 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 33 years as of december 31 2015  approximately 58 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 

  

  



  

  

1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of att wireless and leap wireless cricket wireless 

during the past two years we provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 

  



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 





 

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in our corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers american tower and crown castle have significantly more towers than we do which could provide them a competitive advantage in negotiating with wireless service providers furthermore these entities generally have greater financial resources than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage in connection with the acquisition of material tower portfolios however we believe that tower location and capacity have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business other competitive factors are quality of service to our tenants and price 

international site leasing – o ur competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks as well as large national and regional independent tower companies 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our international regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2015  we had 1310 employees of which 230 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 835 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2015  both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations which were amended in 2014 govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing 

 

authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2015  we had 697 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 66 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2014  we had 264 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 38 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed under executed contracts as of december 31 2015  we had approximately   307   million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 662 million as of december 31 2014

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar  or acquired technologies may be discontinued  in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks and in the case of sprint the nextel iden network was discontinued which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers during 2013 sprint acquired clearwire communications and tmobile acquired metropcs and in 2014 att acquired leap wireless cricket wireless this consolidation may also lead to additional nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us this consolidation could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results 

 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our deficit the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ deficit as of december 31 2015 and 2014  

  



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage for example on june 10  201 5  sba senior finance ii secured a new  5000   m illion senior secured term loan  and on october 1 4  201 5  we through a new york common law trust issued  5000 m illion aggregate principal amount of secured tower revenue securities 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures 

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our revolving credit facility and term loans and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

  

  



  

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments

we derive r evenue through numerous site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the us and canada and renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant site leasing contracts in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple five year renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing customers were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

 

currency fluctuations may negatively affect our results of operations 

we have business operations in canada central america and south america our operations in central america and ecuador are primarily denominated in united states dollars while our operations in canada and brazil are denominated in local currencies our foreign currency denominated revenues and expenses are translated into united states dollars at applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 

for the year ended december 31 2015 approximately 15 of our total cash site leasing revenue was generated by our international operations of which 112 was generated in nonus dollar currencies including 105 which was generated in brazilian r eais the exchange rates between our foreign currencies and the united states dollar have fluctuated significantly recently and may continue to do so in the future for example the brazilian real has historically been subject to substantial volatility and devalued 492 when comparing the spot rate on january 1 2015 and december 31 2015 this trend has adversely affected and may in the future continue to adversely affect our reported results of operations 

changes in exchange rates between these local currencies and the united states dollar will affect the recorded levels of site leasing revenue segment operating profit assets andor liabilities volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

furthermore we have an intercompany loan agreement which permits one of our brazilian entities to borrow amounts up to 7500 million as of december 31 2015 the outstanding balance under this agreement was 4558 million in accordance with asc 830 we remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statements of operations consequently if the us dollar continues to strengthen against the brazilian real our results of operations would be adversely affected for the years ended december 31 2015 and 2014 we recorded 1789 million and 230 million respectively of foreign exchange losses on the remeasurement of intercompany loans 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all in addition the land underlying the 2113 towers we acquired in 2013 from oi sa one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers is subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil that expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government will have the right to i renew the concession upon newly negotiated terms or ii terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land although oi sa has entered into a nonterminable lease with us for 35 years if the concession is not renewed our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate prior to the end of such lease for the year ended december 31 2015 we generated 130 of our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers of which 102 related to oi sa and 28 represented revenue from colocated tenants  

as of december 31 2015 the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was approximately 33 years and approximately 58 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

new technologies or network architecture may reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure or negatively impact our revenues 

improvements or changes in the efficiency architecture and design of wireless networks may reduce the demand for our wireless infrastructure for example new technologies that may promote network sharing joint development or resale agreements by our customers such as signal combining technologies or network functions virtualization may reduce the need for our wireless infrastructure in addition other technologies and architectures  such as wifi das femtocells other small cells or satellite such as low earth orbiting and mesh transmission systems may in the future serve as substitutes for or alternatives to the traditional macro site cellular architecture that is the basis of substantially all of our site leasing business in addition new technologies that enhance the range efficiency and capacity of wireless equipment could reduce demand for our wireless infrastructure any significant reduction in demand for our wireless infrastructure resulting from new technologies or new architectures may negatively impact our revenues or otherwise have a material adverse effect on us  

 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

we intend to continue growing our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers for example in 2015 we passed on more us acquisitions than we did in 2014 due to asset quality price or lease terms furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than we do finally competition regulations domestically and internationally may limit our ability to acquire certain portfolios or apply to us differently than they apply to our competitors as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our annual and longterm tower portfolio growth targets if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm   

we currently intend to build 5 90 to 610 new towers domestically and internationally during 2016 however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds domestically and internationally than anticipated the costs of constructing these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2016 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals   

our international operations are subject to econ omic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada central america  and south america  and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were 149 during the year ended december 31 2015  and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership 

• laws effecting telecommunications infrastructure including the sharing of such infrastructure 

• restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses 

 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

• health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel and 

• language and cultural differences 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues and we cannot control that demand 

additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers to the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers if i these records are not complete or accurate ii we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers or iii the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as i an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models ii unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period iii increased demands on our cash resources that may among other things impact our ability to explore other opportunities iv undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover v increased vulnerability to general economic conditions vi an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships vii additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and viii diversion of managerial attention 

we may not successfully integrate acquired towers into our operations 

as part of our growth strategy we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business it may also result in the loss of key customers andor personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them 

 

there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers 

  delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g including longterm evolution “lte” advanced wireless service in the 16951710 mhz 17551780 mhz and 21552180 mhz bands the “aws3” bands or other new wireless technologies such as 5g will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and continued deployment of 4g could experience delays additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated particularly in certain of our international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow colocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies have been and based on recent consolidations continue to be substantially larger and have gr eater financial resources than we do  this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 575 notes the 5625 notes and the 4875 notes the senior credit agreement and the secured tower revenue securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each indenture limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement t he senior credit agreement  as amended requires sba senior finance ii to maintain speci fic financial ratios including 1 a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 65 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under the revolving credit facility and term loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease there is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk we currently have no interest rate swaps 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the 575 notes the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our 5625 notes and 4875 notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

• the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures 

• the size and scope of our projects 

• the business practices of customers such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year 

• delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment 

• seasonal factors such as weather holidays and vacation days and total business days in a quarter 

• the use of third party providers by our customers 

• the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development and 

• general economic conditions 

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we have not been profitable and may incur losses in the future 

historically we have not been profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

  



  

our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees losses from the extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above  and in 2015 remeasurement losses related to a foreign currency denominated intercompany loan   

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

security breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information which would cause our business and reputation to suffer 

a part of our daytoday operations we rely on information technology and other computer resources and infrastructure to carry out important business activities and to maintain our business records our computer systems could fail on their own accord and are subject to interruption or damage from power outages computer and telecommunications failures computer viruses security breaches including through cyberattack and data theft errors catastrophic events such as natural disasters and other events beyond our control if our computer systems and our backup systems are compromised degraded damaged or breached or otherwise cease to function properly we could suffer interruptions in our operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information including information about our tenants or landlords this could damage our reputation and disrupt our operations and the services we provide to customers which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the 

 

management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize nols in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our nols in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our nols because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized   

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 







 item 2 properties 

o n november 1 2013 we purchased a new headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently own approximately 160000 square feet of office space we have entered into longterm leases for international regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests as of   december 31 2015  approximately 73 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control has been extended to 33 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in south america central america and canada  our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 968 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2015  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2015  we owned 25465 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 5500 actual or potential towers approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2015  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america  site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile verizon wireless oi sa telefonica claro and digicel  wireless service providers enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual site  in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3 4  per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and south american markets typically have an initial term of ten years with multiple   five year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

 

in our central american markets and ecuador significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in our canadian and brazilian operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• straightline rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• deferred lease origination cost amortization 

  ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2  3  annually or in our south american markets adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2015  approximately 73 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

  



  

we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements during 201 6  we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to be consistent with our growth in 201 5  we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers add or upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue other than in connection with customer consolidation or cessations of service eg iden  

 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services on a local basis through regional territory and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 18 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2015  included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates and revenue is recognized as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete amounts billed in advance collected or uncollected are recorded as deferred revenue on the company’s consolidated balance sheets 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and 

 

past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable 

asset impairment 

we evaluate individual longlived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment 

we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible if the future undiscounted cash flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value we record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include but are not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 

business combinations 

we account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date “current contract intangibles” and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites “network location intangibles” and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets which is typically 15 years 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to pay contingent consideration or earnouts in cash or stock if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired we accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through consolidated statements of operations

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains information regarding a nongaap measure adjusted ebitda we have provided below a description of adjusted ebitda a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to its most directly comparable gaap measure and an explanation as to why management utilizes this measure 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related adjustments and expenses asset impairment and decommission costs interest income interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization and provision for or benefit from taxes 

  

we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement and the indentures relating to our 5625 notes 575 notes and 4875 notes adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation other than our contracts in brazil which have inflationary index based rental escalators

the anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 20151c tower securities is october 8 2020 and october 10 2049 respectively 

our current primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk relating to 1 our ability to refinance our debt at commercially reasonable rates if at all 2 interest rate risk relating to the impact of interest rate movements on our 201 4 term loan and 201 5 term loan and any borrowings that we may incur under our revolving credit facility which are at floating rates we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our large percentage of fixed rate debt while we cannot predict our ability to refinance 

 

existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 

we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our operations in brazil canada costa rica guatemala and nicaragua in each of these countries we pay most of our selling general and administrative expenses and a portion of our operating expenses such as taxes and utilities incurred in the country in local currency in addition in brazil and canada we receive significantly all of our revenue and pay significantly all of our operating expenses in local currency all transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are reported in us dollars at the applicable exchange rate all assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period the cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the year ended december 31 2015  approximately 110 of our revenues and approximately 117 of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies 

we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10 adverse movement in the brazilian real from the quoted foreign currency exchange rates at december 31 2015  as of december 31 2015  the analysis indicated that such an adverse movement would have caused our revenues and operating results to fluctuate by less than 20  for the year ended december 31 2015  

durin g 2014 we incurred intercompany debt which is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded as this debt had not been designated as being a longterm investment in nature any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses which will be included in our determination of net income a change of 10 in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt at december 31 2015 would have resulted in approximately 466 million of unrealized gains or losses that would have been included in other expense in our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december 31 2015

part iv 




 item 1 business   

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in canada central america and brazil  our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 963 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2014  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2014  we owned 24292 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 5000 actual or potential towers approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2014  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and brazil site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile oi sa  digicel claro  and telefonica wireless service providers enter into different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit representing 96 2  or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years 

increased expansion activity in international markets has resulted in our international site leasing revenues exceeding 10 of our total revenues as a result commencing in the second quarter of 2014 we classified our site leasing business into two report able segments domestic site leasing and international site leasing 

domestic site leasing 

as of december 31 2014  we had 15124 sites in the united states for the year ended december 31 2014  we generated 851 of our total site leasing revenue from these sites domestic site leasing revenues are received primarily from att sprint verizon wireless and tmobile in the united states wireless service providers typically enter into tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower our tenant leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which typically average 34 per year our ground leases in the united states are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of 5year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 2  3  annually 

international site leasing 

in 2014  we continued to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments as of december 31 2014  we owned 9168 tower s in our international markets including brazil canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama international site leasing revenues are received primarily from oi sa  telefonica claro digicel tim and nii holdings  our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to continue to expand operations through new builds and acquisitions   

our tenant leases in canada typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states with an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year tenant leases in our central america and brazil markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in brazil typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index in brazil site leases are typically governed by master lease agreements which provide for the material terms and conditions that will govern the terms of the use of the site 

 

these site leases typically provide for a fixed rental amount and a passthrough charge for a portion of the underlying ground lease rent our ground leases in canada central america and brazil generally have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states except that the annual escalator in brazil is based on a cost of living index 

domestic and international expansion 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks ii consumers’ increased use of high data applications such as email internet access mobile device applications and video and iii incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments since we first entered brazil in 2012 we have built or acquired 6927 towers and continue to expand in that country to respond to a growing demand there additionally  since we first entered costa rica in 2010 spectrum auctions significantly increased demand for antenna space since we entered this market we have built or acquired 499 towers to respond to that demand and plan to continue our expansion   

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 







in our new build program we construct tower structures in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants during 2015  we intend to build between 57 5 and 595 new tower structures domestically and internationally 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our towers site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 site audits  2  identification of potential locations for towers and antennas  3  modification of lease agreements to add equipment to existing structures 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower structure construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services on a local basi s    through regional territory  and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area   

 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video the deployment of additional spectrum and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of towers that they use and an increase in the amount of equipment they deploy at existing towers we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 











we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is reasonably wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional demand for tower space from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity  we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2014  we had an average of 18 tenants per tower structure  

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio    we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses during 2015  we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally by 510  through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor long term leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2014  approximately 73 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 33 years as of december 31 2014  approximately 50 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years   

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 

  

  



  

  

 1  prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of sprint and clearwire   

2 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of att wireless and leap wireless cricket wireless 

3 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and metro pcs 

during the past two years we provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 

  



 

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

• use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned or managed towers enabling us to grow our site leasing business and 

• successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins andor provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business 

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

domestic site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers american tower and crown castle have significantly more towers than we do which could provide them a competitive advantage in negotiating with wireless service providers furthermore these entities generally have greater financial resources than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage in connection with the acquisition of material tower portfolios however we believe that tower location and capacity have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business other competitive factors are quality of service to our tenants and price 

international site leasing – in brazil our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks as well as large national and regional independent tower companies while in the central american and canadian markets our competition is principally from wireless service providers who lease towers to other wireless providers 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our international regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2014  we had 1259 employees of which 184 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 851 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2014  both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations which were amended in 2014 govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws 

 

these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2014  we had 264 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 38 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2013  excluding the sprint network vision amendment we had 478 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 64 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2014  we had approximately 662 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 651 million as of december 31 2013

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint the combined companies have 

 

rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers during 2013 sprint acquired clearwire communications and tmobile acquired metropcs and in 2014 att acquired leap wireless cricket wireless this consolidation may also lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us this consolidation could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity deficit the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2014 and 2013  

  



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage for example on february 7 2014 sba senior finance ii secured a new 15 billion senior secured term loan  on july 1 2014 we issued 7500 million aggregate principal amount of 4875 senior notes  and on october 15 2014 we through a new york common law trust issued 154 billion aggregate principal amount of secured tower revenue securities 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures 

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our revolving credit facility and term loans and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

  

  



  

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

  

  



  

  



  

  

 1  prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of sprint and clearwire   

2 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of att wireless and leap wireless cricket wireless 

3 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and metro pcs 

revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the us and canada and renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant site leasing contracts in our central and brazil markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to 

 

experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues and we cannot control that demand 

additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada central america and brazil and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were 133 during the year ended december 31 2014  and we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will continue to grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally  including 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership 

• restriction or revocation of spectrum licenses 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

 

• health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel and 

• language and cultural differences 

our international operations in central america are primarily denominated in united states dollars while our operations in canada and brazil are denominated in local currencies the brazilian real has been subject to significant volatility and the united states dollar has strengthened significantly against the brazilian real and canadian dollar in the last 6 months if this trend were to continue it could adversely affect our reported results of operations volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

in addition two of our wholly owned subsidiaries brazil shareholder i llc a florida limited liability company and sba torres brasil limitada a limitada existing under the laws of the republic of brazil entered into an intercompany loan agreement where from time to time the entities may agree to lendborrow amounts up to 7500 million in accordance with asc 830 we are required to remeasure foreign denominated intercompany loans with the corresponding change in the balance being recorded in other expense in the consolidated statements of operations consequently if the us d ollar strengthens against the brazilian rea l our results of operations would be adversely affected 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all in addition the land underlying the 2113 towers we acquired from oi sa one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers  in 2013 is subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil tha t expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government would have the right to i renew the concession upon ne wly negotiated terms or ii terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land  although oi sa has entered into a nonterminable lease with us for 35 years if the concession was not renewed our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate  for the year ended december 31 2014  we generated   216 o f our total international site leasing revenue from these 2113 towers  

as of december 31 2014  the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was approximately 33 years and approximately 50 of our tower structures hav e ground leases maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition   

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

w e intend to grow our tower por tfolio domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds and expect this growth to be between 510 during 2015 our ability to meet our growth targets significantly depends on our ability to build or acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our longterm tower portfolio growth target if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

we curren tly intend to build 575 to 595 new towers domestically and internationally during 2015  however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets 

 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2015  if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider ie network sharing could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antenna” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space if any of these or other new technologies are widely adopted in the future it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers to the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers if i these records are not complete or accurate ii we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers or iii the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated it could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as i an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models ii unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period iii increased demands on our cash resources that may among other things impact our ability to explore other opportunities iv undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover v increased vulnerability to general economic conditions vi an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships vii additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and viii diversion of managerial attention 

we may not successfully integrate acquired towers into our operations 

as part of our growth strategy we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business it may also result in the loss of key customers andor personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers 

  delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g including longterm evolution “lte” or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and deployment 

 

of 4g could experience delays additionally  the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated particularly in certain of our international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow colocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies have been and based on recent consolidations continue to be substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 575 notes the 5625 notes and the 4875 notes the senior credit agreement and the secured tower revenue securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each indenture limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement as amended in february 2014 the senior credit agreement requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including at the sba senior finance ii level 1 a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 65 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under the revolving credit facility and term loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease there is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk we currently have no interest rate swaps 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the 575 notes the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding warrants related to our convertible notes 5625 notes and 4875 notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

• the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures 

• the size and scope of our projects 

• the business practices of customers such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year 

• delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment 

• seasonal factors such as weather vacation days and total business days in a quarter 

• the use of third party providers by our customers 

• the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development and 

• general economic conditions 

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we have not been profitable and may incur losses in the future  

historically we have not been profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated   

  



  

our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the faa and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized   

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain 

 

negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 







 item 2 properties 

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 103000 square feet of office space in multiple buildings these leases expire at different dates extending through february 28 2022 in addition on november 1 2013 we purchased a new headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently own approximately 160000 square feet of office space we have entered into longterm leases for international regional  and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in canada central america and brazil  our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 963 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2014  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements as of december 31 2014  we owned 24292 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 5000 actual or potential towers  approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2014  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and brazil site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile oi sa digicel claro and telefonica wireless service providers enter into different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central american and brazilian markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in brazil escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• straightline rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• deferred lease origination cost amortization 

  ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23  annually or in brazil adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2014  approximately 73 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally 

 

increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

in our central american markets significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in our canadian and brazilian operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency  

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  

  



  

we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements  during 2015 we expect organic site leasing revenue in both our domestic and international segments to be consistent with our growth in 2014  we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2014  included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of 

 

revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable 

asset impairment 

we evaluate individual longlived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment 

we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible if the future undiscounted cash   flows are lower than the carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible we calculate future discounted cash flows and compare those amounts to the carrying value we record an impairment charge for any amounts lower than the carrying value estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include but are not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 

business combinations 

we account for business combinatio ns under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date “current contract 

 

i ntangibles” and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites “network location intangibles” and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets which is typically 15 years 

in connection with certain acquisitions we may agree to pay contingent consideration or earnouts if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired we accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through consolidated statements of operations

 item 1 business   

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in canada central america and south america our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 962 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2013  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2013  we owned 20079 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased   approximately 4800 actual or potential towers  approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2013  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile oi digicel claro and telefonica wireless service providers enter into different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central and south america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the acquisition of towers from third parties and through the construction of new tower structures  in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

in our new build program we construct tower structures in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build tower structures for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower structure and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants when we construct tower structures in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new tower structures and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower structure on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants during 2014  we intend to build between 400 and 420 new tower structures domestically and internationally 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit our site leasing business generated 868 of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2013 and has represented 962 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years 

international site leasing 

in 2013  we continued to focus on growing our international site leasing business through the acquisition and development of towers we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments at december 31 2013  we owned 5196   towers in brazil canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama this site count includes the exclusive rights to 2113 towers in brazil which we acquired from oi sa one of brazil’s largest telecommunications providers “oi” in december 2013 we entered into a definitive agreement with oi to acquire an additional 2007 towers in brazil which is 

 

expected to close march 31 2014 for the year ended december 31 2013  site leasing revenue generated outside the us and its territories was 65 of total revenue 

the majority of our international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and lower wireless data penetration rates than those in the united states accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks ii consumers’ increased use of high data applications such as email internet access mobile device applications and video and iii incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments for example since we first entered costa rica in 2010 spectrum auctions significantly increased demand for antenna space since we entered this market we have built or acquired 430 towers to respond to that demand and plan to continue our expansion 

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 

• country analysis – we consider the country’s political stability and whether the country’s general business legal and regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business 

• market potential – we analyze the expected demand for wireless services and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur 

• risk adjusted return criteria – we consider whether buying or building towers in a country and providing our management and leasing services will meet our return criteria as part of this analysis we consider the risk of entering into an international market for example the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and how our expansion meets our longterm strategic objectives for the region and our business generally 

  

we intend to continue expanding through acquisition and newbuilds in our current international markets and to explore opportunities in other international markets that meet our investment criteria 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our towers site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower structure construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance 

we provide our site development services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video the deployment of additional spectrum and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of towers that they use or the number of antennas at existing towers we expect that the wireless communications industry will continue to experience growth as a result of the following trends 

• as wireless data usage grows rapidly all four us nationwide carriers are deploying new and upgraded networks and we believe that the continued deployment of 4g wireless technologies will require our customers to add large numbers of additional cell sites and additional equipment at current cell sites 

 

• we have seen and anticipate there could be other new entrants into the wireless communications industry that could deploy regional or national wireless networks for voice and data services 

• spectrum licensed by the federal communications commission in 2006 and 2008 has enabled continued network development  w e expect this and the potential availability of additional spectrum through several planned government auctions in 2014 and beyond to enable continued network development in the us 

• consumers are increasing their use of wireless data services due to expansion of wireless data applications such as email web browsing mobile apps and games social networking music and video and continued wireline to wireless migration wireless devices are trending toward more bandwidth intensive devices such as smartphones laptops netbooks tablets and other emerging and embedded devices a s a result according to industry estimates global mobile data traffic will grow at an approximately 61  compound annual growth rate from 2013 to 201 8    

• consumers list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service to decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage for example us wireless carriers’ capital expenditures have increased from an estimated 199 billion in 2009 to an estimat ed 320 billion in 2013 a nd we expect capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to remain elevated as wireless carriers continue to improve their networks 

despite the recent economic challenges affecting the global marketplace we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional equipment demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity  we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity tower structures most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force as of december 31 2013  we had an average of 19 tenants per tower structure  

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio    we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses during 2014 we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally by 1015 through tower acquisitions and the construction of new tower structures in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communications industry we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of towers with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing towers for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated towers for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased andor entered into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our tower structures and intend to continue to do so to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from 

 

operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2013  approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 31 years as of december 31 2013  approximately 43 of our tower structures have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as locationspecific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 

  



  

1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of sprint and clearwire 

2 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and metro pcs 

during the past two years we provided services or leased space to a number of customers including 

  



sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

• use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with respect to our owned or managed towers enabling us to grow our site leasing business and 

 

• successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins andor provide a financial or strategic benefit to our site leasing business 

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts by geographic region or to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff’s compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

site leasing – in the us our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation and crown castle international 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers american tower and crown castle have significantly more towers than we do which could provide them a competitive advantage in negotiating with wireless service providers however we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business furthermore these entities generally have greater financial resources than we do which may provide them with a competitive advantage in connection with the acquisition of material tower portfolios in brazil our competition consists of wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks as well as large national and regional independent tower companies while in the central american and canadian markets our competition is principally from wireless service providers who lease towers to other wireless providers 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our international regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2013  we had 1117 employees of which 138 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 926 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2013  both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate towers many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc tower structure registration through the fcc’s antenna structure registration system must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a 

 

controlled substance new tower construction also requires approval from the state or local governing authority for the proposed site compliance with the national environmental policy act “nepa” compliance with the national historic preservation act “nhpa” compliance with the endangered species act “esa” and may require notification to the faa 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower the relationship of the tower to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications towers may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations tower owners and licensees that operate on those towers also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws including nepa nhpa and esa any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the nepa among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the nepa these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying a tower and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of towers failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal injury or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement and may require preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from tower structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to 

 

secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2013  we had 478 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 64 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2012  excluding the sprint network vision amendment we had 1052 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 81 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2013  we had approximately 291 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 459 million as of december 31 2012

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers during 2013 sprint acquired clearwire communications and tmobile acquired metropcs and att has a pending agreement to acquire leap wireless which may also lead to nonrenewal of certain of our tower leases if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us this consolidation could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2013 and 2012  



our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage for example on february 7 2014 sba senior finance ii secured a new delayed draw 15 bi llion senior secured term loan  

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

• we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions 

• we may have to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable rate indebtedness if interest rates rise thereby reducing our cash flows 

• we may find it more difficult to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements that would be in our best longterm interests 

• we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt reducing the available cash flow to fund other investments including tower acquisition and new build capital expenditures 

• we may have limited flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business or in the industry 

 

• we may have a competitive disadvantage relative to other companies in our industry that are less leveraged and 

• we may be required to sell debt or equity securities or sell some of our core assets possibly on unfavorable terms in order to meet payment obligations 

these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our revolving credit facility and term loans and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth our substantial acquisitions in 2013 further increased our client concentration and exacerbated the risks associated with such concentration 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

  



  

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

  



  

1 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of sprint and clearwire 

2 prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the merger of tmobile and metro pcs 

revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the us and canada and renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant our central and south america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience 

 

financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues and we cannot control that demand 

additional revenue growth on our towers other than through contractual escalators comes directly from additional investment by our wireless service provider customers in their networks if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or data usage or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada central america and south america and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were 65 during the year ended december 31 2013  we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic conditions 

• laws and regulations that tax or otherwise restrict repatriation of earnings or other funds or otherwise limit distributions of capital 

• laws and regulations that dictate how we operate our towers and conduct business including zoning maintenance and environmental matters and laws related to ownership of real property 

• laws and regulations governing our employee relations including occupational health and safety matters 

• changes to existing or new domestic or international tax laws or fees directed specifically at the ownership and operation of towers which may be applied and enforced retroactively 

• expropriation and governmental regulation restricting foreign ownership 

• restricting or revoking spectrum licenses 

• our ability to comply with and the costs of compliance with antibribery laws such as the foreign corrupt practices act and similar local antibribery laws 

• our ability to compete with owners and operators of wireless towers that have been in the international market for a longer period of time than we have 

• uncertainties regarding legal or judicial systems including inconsistencies between and within laws regulations and decrees and judicial application thereof and delays in the judicial process 

 

• health or similar issues such as a pandemic or epidemic 

• difficulty in recruiting and retaining trained personnel and 

• language and cultural differences 

our international operations in central america are denominated in united states dollars while our operations in canada and brazil are denominated in local currencies the brazil reais has been subject to significant volatility in the past which can expose us to additional exchange rate risk volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our tower structures consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our tower structures which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all in addition the land underlying the 2113 towers we acquired from oi in 2013 is subject to a concession from the federal republic of brazil tha t expires in 2025 at the end of the term the brazilian government would have the right to i renew the concession upon ne wly negotiated terms or ii terminate the concession and take possession of the land and the tower on such land  although oi has entered into a nonterminable lease with us for 35 years if the concession was not renewed our site leasing revenue from colocated tenants would terminate 

as of december 31 2013  the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was approximately 31 years and approximately 43 of our tower structures having ground leases maturing in the next 10 years failure to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our communication site portfolio long term 

over the long term we intend to grow our tower por tfolio by at least   510 annually  domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to meet our longterm tower portfolio growth target if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

our convertible note hedge transactions may not cover all of the potential dilution or additional cash outlay if we settled the notes in cash to which we may be subject upon conversion of the notes 

concurrently with the pricing of our 40 convertible senior notes due 2014 the “40 notes” we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 40 notes is 3038 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 40 notes and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is 4464 per share pursuant to the terms of the warrant transaction we are responsible for the dilution or costs to the extent that we settle in cash or stock arising from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants if the market price of our class a common stock significantly exceeded the strike price on the conversion date we would be subject to material dilution or to the extent we elected to settle in cash material additional costs   

initially we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 40 notes if any of the counterparties to our convertible hedge transactions were to default in their 

 

obligations then our potential dilution or costs upon conversion of the respective notes would be materially increased as of december 31 2013 there were 16457321 shares underlying the warrants outstanding 

at the end of the first quarter of 201 3  the 40 notes were convertible by the note holders because our class a common stock closing price per share exceeded 3949 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on march 31 201 3  the requisite conditions were again met throughout 201 3 and into 2 01 4  the 40 notes remained convertible by the note holders  wi ll continue to be convertible through march 31 2014  and will still be convertible thereafter if one or more of the conversion conditions are satisfied in addition the 40 notes will be automatically convertible at any time on or after july 22 2014 and mature on october 1 2014 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider ie network sharing could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antenna” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space if any of these or other new technologies are widely adopted in the future it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations 

we may not be able to fully recognize the anticipated benefits of towers that we acquire 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions we rely on our due diligence of the towers and the representations and financial records of the sellers and other third parties to establish the anticipated revenues and expenses and whether the acquired towers will meet our internal guidelines for current and future potential returns in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers to the extent that these towers were acquired in individually material transactions we may be required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of the sellers if i these records are not complete or accurate ii if we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers or iii if the towers do not achieve the financial results anticipated it could adversely affect the our revenues and results of operations 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as i an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models ii unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period iii increased demands on our cash resources that may among other things impact our ability to explore other opportunities iv undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover v increased vulnerability to general economic conditions vi an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships vii additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and viii diversion of managerial attention 

we may not successfully integrate acquired towers into our operations 

as part of our growth strategy we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business it may also result in the loss of key customers andor personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business this is particularly true in our international acquisitions of towers from wireless service providers 

  

  

 

  delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g including longterm evolution “lte” or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and deployment of 4g could experience delays additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated particularly in certain of our international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies have been and based on recent consolidations continue to be substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

• wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers 

• national and regional tower companies and 

• alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor das networks billboards and electric transmission towers 

we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment may come under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

  

  

  

  

 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 825 notes the 575 notes and the 5625 notes the senior credit agreement and the secured tower revenue securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each indenture limit our ability to 

• merge consolidate or sell assets 

• make restricted payments including pay dividends or make other distributions 

• enter into transactions with affiliates 

• enter into sale and leaseback transactions and 

• issue guarantees of indebtedness 

we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement as amended in february 2014 the senior credit agreement requires sba senior finance ii to maintain specific financial ratios including at the sba senior finance ii level 1 a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 65 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 65 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under the revolving credit facility and term loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease there is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk we currently have no interest rate swaps 

  

 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the 825 notes the 575 notes the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes and 5625 notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

• the timing and amount of our customers’ capital expenditures 

• the size and scope of our projects 

• the business practices of customers such as deferring commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers’ fiscal year 

• delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment 

• seasonal factors such as weather vacation days and total business days in a quarter 

• the use of third party providers by our customers 

• the rate and volume of wireless service providers’ network development and 

• general economic conditions 

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

  



  

our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our executive vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our executive vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our executive vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the federal aviation administration “faa” and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of towers and structures that support antennas used for wireless communications and radio and television broadcasts in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of the tower certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation 

tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint such towers or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from towers are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements established in federal statutes including nepa nhpa and esa failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

  

 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower structures we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss 

 

deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized   

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of our convertible notes could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims our current policies provide no coverage for claims based on rf energy exposure if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

 







 item 2 properties   

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 103000 square feet of office space in multiple buildings these leases expire at different dates extending through february 28 2022 in addition on november 1 2013 we purchased a new headquarters in boca raton florida where we currently own approximately 160000 square feet of office space we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate   

our interests in towers and the land beneath them are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests for the year ended december 31 2013  approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control has been extended to 31 years in rural areas support for our towers equipment shelters and related equipment requires a tract of land typically up to 10000 square feet less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications towers land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications tower structures rooftops and other structures that support antennas used for wireless communications which we collectively refer to as “towers” or “sites” our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in canada central america and south america our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 962 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2013  in our site leasing business we 1 lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers that we own or operate and 2 manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2013  we owned 20079 towers a substantial portion of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 4800 actual or potential towers  approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2013  our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile oi digicel claro and telefonica wireless service providers enter into different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central and south america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

• rental payments on ground leases and other underlying property interests 

• straightline rent adjustment for the difference between rental payments made and the expense recorded as if the payments had been made evenly throughout the lease term which may include renewal terms of the underlying property interests 

• property taxes 

• site maintenance and monitoring costs exclusive of employee related costs 

• utilities 

• property insurance and 

• deferred lease origination cost amortization 

  ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 23 annually  or in brazil adjust in accordance with a standard cost of living index as of december 31 2013  approximately 72 of our tower structures were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given 

 

tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

  



  

  

  



  

1 site leasing segment operating profit and total segment operating profit are nongaap financial measures we reconcile these measures and other regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled nongaap financial measures 

we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are earned primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we provide site development services at our towers and at towers owned by others 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 20 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

international operations 

as of december 31 2013  we had operations in canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua panama and brazil our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to expand operations through new builds and acquisitions tenant leases in the canadian market typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states with an initial term of five years and specific rent escalators tenant leases in central america and brazil typically have a ten year initial term tenant leases in central america typically have similar renewal terms and rent escalators as those in the united states and canada while those in brazil are based on a standard cost of living index 

in our central american markets significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically most of our ground leases tenant leases and towerrelated expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in our canadian and brazilian operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2013  included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

on october 31 2011 we entered into a master amendment with one of our wireless service provider customers the master amendment serves as a separate amendment to each individual existing tenant lease agreement that we are currently a party to with that customer among other items the master amendment 1 extends the current term of the individual leases 2 permits the customer limited early termination rights which will be exercisable over a multiyear period commencing in the second half of 2013 on a specific number of the existing leases 3 allows the customer to make certain specific equipment changes at the towers in 

 

exchange for an increase in monthly rental payment due from the customer and 4 slightly modifies the existing monthly lease rates of certain leases the customer’s early termination rights are limited with respect to the aggregate number of leases that may be terminated and the number that may be terminated in any quarter a portion of the remaining specific leases to be terminated early and the timing of such terminations has not been determined as of the date of this filing as a result for accounting and financial statement purposes we have made assumptions with regard to the remaining leases to be terminated and the timing of the terminations we have assumed that the customer will terminate the maximum number of leases allowable in each quarter selecting the highest rental rate leases at the earliest allowable dates we believe that these assumptions will ensure that only the minimum known revenue for the pool of leases covered by the master agreement will be accrued on a straightline basis our balance sheet and statement of operations reflect these assumptions the actual leases that the customer terminates and the timing and number of terminations may or may not be those that we have identified in our assumptions we will monitor actual results and elections under the master amendment and record any differences from previously made assumptions on a quarterly basis to the extent that the actual results materially differ from the assumptions made we will disclose the impact of these adjustments 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable 

asset impairment 

we evaluate individual longlived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment 

we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower and related intangible estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include but are not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 

business combinations 

we account for acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting the assets and liabilities we acquire are recorded at fair market value at the date of each acquisition and the results of operations of the acquired assets are included with our results of operations from the dates of the respective acquisitions we continue to evaluate all acquisitions for a period not to exceed one year after the applicable closing date of each transaction to determine whether any additional adjustments are needed to the allocation of the purchase price paid for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a result of information available at the acquisition date the intangible assets represent the value associated with the current leases at the acquisition date “current contract intangibles” and future tenant leases anticipated to be added to the communication sites “network location intangibles” and were calculated using the discounted values of the current or future expected cash flows the intangible assets are estimated to have a useful life consistent with the useful life of the related communication site assets which is typically 15 years 

in connection with certain acquisitions the we may agree to pay additional consideration or earnouts if the communication sites or businesses that are acquired meet or exceed certain performance targets over a period of one to three years after they have been acquired we record contingent consideration for acquisitions that occurred prior to january 1 2009 when the contingent consideration is paid effective january 1 2009 we accrue for contingent consideration in connection with acquisitions at fair value as of the date of the acquisition all subsequent changes in fair value of contingent consideration are recorded through consolidated statements of operations in certain acquisitions the additional consideration may be paid in cash or shares of class a common stock at our option 

  

  

 

  key performance indicators 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including segment operating profit and adjusted ebitda information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures 

segment operating profit 

we believe that segment operating profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation accretion and amortization which is largely fixed and noncash in nature segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

  



  

site leasing segment operating profit increase d 2051   million for the year ended december 31 2013  as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional profit generated by 1 9159 towers acquired and 690   towers built since january 1 2012 w hich include towers acquired in the mobilitie towerco vivo  and oi acquisitions 2 organic site leasing growth from new leases 3 contractual rent escalators and 4 lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent as a result of additional equipment added to our towers in addition to improving control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

site leasing segment operating profit increased 1728 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily due to additional profit generated by 1 7715 towers acquired and 744 towers built since january 1 2011 2 organic site leasing growth from new leases 3 contractual rent escalators and 4 lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent as a result of additional equipment added to our towers in addition to improving control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

the increase in site development segment operating profit of 170 million for the year ended december 31 2013 is primarily due to the higher volume of work performed compared to the prior year associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers in particular the sprint network vision and tmobile modernization initiative s  

the increase in site development segment operating profit of 66 million for the year ended december 31 2012 is primarily due to the higher volume of work performed compared to the prior year associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including sprint’s network vision and the tmobile modernization initiative s  site development work mandated to us through our sprint and tmobile master lease amendments contributed to this increased volume 

 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments the reconciliation of segment operating profit is as follows 

  



  

  



  

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related expenses asset impairment and decommission costs net interest expenses depreciation accretion and amortization provision for taxes and income from discontinued operations 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement 825 notes 5625 notes and 575 notes adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap 

 

the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

  



  

1 interest expense includes interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees 

2 provision for taxes includes 817  1095 and 1978 of franchise taxes reflected in selling general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended 2013  2012 and 2011  respectively 

  a djusted ebitda was 7972 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 5879 million for the year ended december 31 2012  the increase of 2093 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing and site development segments offset partially by the increase in our cash selling general and administrative expenses 

adjusted ebitda was 5879 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 4449 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase of 1430 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing and site development segments offset partially by the increase in our cash selling general and administrative expenses

year ended 2012 compared to year ended 2011 

  



  

revenues 

site leasing revenue increased 2298 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year due largely to i revenues from 7715 towers acquired and 744 towers built since january 1 2011 including 1257 million of additional revenue from the mobilitie and towerco acquisitions ii organic site leasing growth from new leases contractual rent escalators with current tenants and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our 

 

towers and iii increased straightline leasing revenue associated with the sprint network vision agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the master lease amendment entered into with tmobile in september 2012 

site development revenue increased 261 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 as a result of a higher volume of work performed during 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including sprint’s network vision initiative 

operating expenses 

site leasing cost of revenues increased 570 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of towers owned by us including 313 million the majority of which is reimbursable to us from the mobilitie towers acquired in the second quarter and 179 million from the towerco towers acquired in the fourth quarter 

site development cost of revenues increased 196 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year due to a higher volume of work performed during 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including sprint’s network vision initiative

acquisition related expenses increased 333 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the number of acquisitions acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended december 31 2012 associated with the mobilitie and towerco acquisitions were 306 million 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 993 million to 4085 million for the year ended december 31 2012 from 3091 million for the year ended december 31 2011 due to an increase in the number of towers built and acquired by us including through the mobilitie and towerco acquisitions depreciation accretion and amortization expense recorded during the year ended december 31 2012 includes 731 million related to mobilitie and towerco 

operating income 

operating income increased 365 million for year ended december 31 2012 to 1471 million compared to 1107 million for the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to higher segment operating profit in both the site leasing and site development segments offset by increases in depreciation accretion and amortization expense acquisition related expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

other income expense 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 353 million from the year ended december 31 2011 primarily due to the higher weighted average principal amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding during the year ended december 31 2012 resulting from the issuance of the 2011 term loan 20121 term loan 575 notes mobilitie bridge loan 2012 tower securities 5625 notes and the 20122 term loan these were offset by the full redemption of 3750 million of principal balance of the 80 notes and the redemption of 1313 million in aggregate principal balance of the 825 notes 

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2012 increased 65 million from the year ended december 31 2011 primarily as a result of accretion of debt discounts using the effective interest method on the1875 notes the 40 notes and the senior notes this was offset by the repurchase of 150 million in principal amount of the 1875 notes in the first quarter of 2011 the repurchase of 662 million in principal amount of the 1875 notes in the fourth quarter of 2012 and by the redemption of 3750 million of the 80 notes and 1313 million of the 825 notes in 2012

notes comparatively the loss from extinguishment of debt was 17 million for the year ended december 31 2011 which was due to the repurchase of 150 million in principal amount of the 1875 notes 

net loss 

net loss was 1814 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 1269 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the net loss increased in 2012 primarily due to increases in the loss on extinguishment of debt acquisition related expenses depreciation accretion and amortization expense as well as interest expense noncash interest expense and selling general and administrative costs this was offset by an increase in our site leasing segment and site development segment operating profit 

liquidity and capital resources 

sba communications corporation “sbac” is a holding company with no business operations of its own sbac’s only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications llc “telecommunications” which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in entities that directly or indirectly own all of our domestic and international towers and assets we conduct all of our business operations through telecommunications’ subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries 

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

  



  

operating activities 

cash provided by operating activities was 4976 million for the year ended december 31 2013 as compared to 3409 million for the year ended december 31 2012  this increase was primarily due to an increase in segment operating profit from the site leasing and site development operating segments partially offset by increased selling general and administrative expenses as well as increased cash interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended   december 31 2013 compared to the year ended december 31 2012  

  

 

investing activities 

a detail of our cash capital expenditures is as follows 

  



  

1 included in our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2013 is 1759 million related to our acquisition of 800 towers from vivo in fourth quarter of 2012 

2 excludes 97 million spent to extend ground lease terms for the year ended december 31 2013   2012  subsequent to december 31 2013  we acquired 154 towers and related assets for 2301 million in cash 

during fiscal year 2014  we expect to incur nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of  200 million to  250 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures based on current obligations of 11200 million to 11500 million primarily associated with new tower construction additional tower   acquisitions tower augmentations and ground lease purchases we expect to fund these additional cash capital expenditures from cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility  as well as the proceeds of the company’s 15 billion incremental term loan b completed february 2014  the exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and acquisition programs and our ground lease purchase program 

financing activities 

on april 18 2013 we issued 133 billion of 2013 tower securities as defined below which have a blended interest rate of 3218 per annum payable monthly and a weighted average life through the anticipated repayment date of 72 years the proceeds from this issuance were used to settle our obligations under our 1875 notes pay down the outstanding balance under our revolving credit facility and pay down 3107 million of principal balance of our 2011 term loan and 1893 million of principal balance of our 20122 term loan

part iv 




 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in canada central america and south america our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 974 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2012 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space primarily to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2012 we owned 17491 tower sites the majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 4800 actual or potential communications sites approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2012 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile digicel claro and telefonica wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central and south america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the construction of new towers or new builds and through the acquisition of towers from third parties in our new build program we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants during 2013 we intend to build between 380 and 400 new towers domestically and internationally 

in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past three years 

 

  

 as of december 31 2012 we had an average of 20 tenants per tower 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit our site leasing business generated 887 of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2012 and has represented 974 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years for the year ended december 31 2012 site leasing revenues generated outside the us and its territories was less than 6 of total revenue 

international operations 

in 2012 we continued to focus on growing our international operations including the acquisition of 800 towers in brazil we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments at december 31 2012 we owned 2562 towers in brazil canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama and intend to continue expanding in these and other international markets the majority of these international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and wireless data penetration accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks ii consumers’ increased use of high data applications such as email internet access and video and iii incremental spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as incremental voice and data network deployments for example we have had a meaningful buildout of our new towers and communication sites in costa rica as a result of spectrum auctions in that country we expect to continue expanding internationally through buying or building towers managing communication sites and leasing space to wireless service providers on assets we control 

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 

 

  

  

   

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance 

we provide our site development services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 21 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video the deployment of additional spectrum and technology advancements will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication sites the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

 

  

  

  

  

   

despite the recent economic challenges affecting the global marketplace based on these factors we believe that the worldwide wireless industry will continue to grow and is wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a majority of our towers are high capacity towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio  we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses during 2013 we intend to continue to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally by 5 to 10 through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communication industry we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of tower and other communication sites with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing communication sites for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated tower sites for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into perpetual easements or longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially 

  

reasonable prices we believe that these purchases perpetual easements andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future for the quarter ended december 31 2012 approximately 70 of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control was 31 years as of december 31 2012 approximately 61 of our tower sites have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site leasing and site development businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during the last three years 

 

 during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

   

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

competition 

site leasing – our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation crown castle international and global tower partners 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers as a result of several large mergers and acquisitions american tower and crown castle have more towers and greater financial resources than we do wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business internationally to date the competition we have encountered has been from both independent tower companies and wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks in our central american and canadian markets the majority of existing towers are owned by wireless service providers in brazil our competition includes wireless service providers as well as independent tower companies 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms offer their services nationally the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

  

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our international regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2012 we had 1022 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement of these 1022 employees 103 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations in the us which accounted for 943 of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2012 both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures as well as the maintenance inspection and record keeping related to towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential 

  

significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an existing 

  

tower additionally some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting lighting and maintenance our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign ownership of land in certain areas based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us noncompliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties or deconstruction orders our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2012 excluding the sprint network vision amendment we had 1052 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments will contractually provide for approximately 81 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2011 we had 251 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases and amendments contractually provided for approximately 51 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2012 we had approximately 459 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 145 million as of december 31 2011

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us this consolidation could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2011 and 2012 

 

 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts due on our indebtedness subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

 

  

  

   

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our revolving credit facility and term loans and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers consequently a reduction in demand for site leasing reduced future capital expenditures on the networks or the loss as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise of any of our largest customers could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth our substantial acquisitions in 2012 further increased our client concentration and exacerbated the risks associated with such concentration 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

 we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

   

 revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five to ten years in the us and canada and renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant our central and south america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks including licenses for spectrum in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada central america and south america and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were less than 6 during the year ended december 31 2012 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the majority of our international operations are denominated in united states dollars however for some of our international operations particularly brazil we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of the agreements for the land under our towers which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew agreements on commercially viable terms or at all our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers to the extent that we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers it could require us to incur additional expenses before we can operate and generate revenue from such tower 

  

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long term 

we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5 to 10 annually domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us as a result of these risks the cost of acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2013 if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

our convertible note hedge transactions may not cover all of the potential dilution or additional cash outlay if we settled the notes in cash to which we may be subject upon conversion of the notes 

concurrently with the pricing of our 1875 convertible senior notes due 2013 the “1875 notes” and our 40 convertible senior notes due 2014 the “40 notes” we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1875 notes is 4146 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of our 1875 convertible notes and the upper strike price of the warrants is 6737 per share the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 40 convertible notes is 3038 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 40 notes and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is 4464 per share pursuant to the terms of the warrant transaction we are responsible for the dilution or costs to the extent that we settle in cash or stock arising from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants we have purchased an aggregate of 812 million in principal amount of the 1875 notes and 4688 million remains outstanding if the market price of our class a common stock significantly exceeded either of these strike prices on their respective conversion dates we would be subject to material dilution or to the extent we elected to settle in cash material additional costs 

initially we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes and the 40 notes however as a result of the bankruptcy of lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction that we had entered into with lehman derivatives the terminated convertible note hedge transaction had originally covered 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1875 notes consequently we do not currently have a hedge with respect to that percentage of the shares issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds 4146 per share upon conversion of the notes we will be subject to dilution or if we settle in cash additional costs upon conversion of that portion of the 1875 notes if any of the other counterparties to our convertible hedge transactions were to default in their obligations then our potential dilution or costs upon conversion of the respective notes would be materially increased 

at the end of the first quarter of 2012 the 40 notes became convertible by the note holders because our class a common stock closing price per share exceeded 3949 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on march 31 2012 the requisite conditions were again met as of the end of the second third and fourth quarters of 2012 and the 40 notes remained convertible by the note holders the 40 notes will continue to be convertible through march 31 2013 and will still be convertible thereafter if one or more of the conversion conditions are satisfied 

  

at the end of the third quarter of 2012 the conversion right for the 1875 notes was triggered because our class a common stock closing price per share exceeded 5390 for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on september 30 2012 the requisite conditions were again met as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2012 and the 1875 notes remained convertible by the note holders the 1875 notes will continue to be convertible until march 31 2013 and may be convertible thereafter if one or more of the conversion conditions are satisfied 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider ie network sharing could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space if any of these or other new technologies are widely adopted in the future it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations 

our acquisition initiatives may disrupt our operations or heighten the risks inherent in our growth strategy in addition future acquisitions that are material in the aggregate may increase our debt levels and our leverage 

a key element of our growth strategy is to increase our tower portfolio through acquisitions consequently as part of our business we evaluate potential acquisitions some of which may be individually or in the aggregate materially significant in terms of the number of towers to be acquired or the price that we would need to pay any future acquisitions that we may consummate that are material could increase our absolute level of debt and our pro forma leverage ratio 

in addition acquisitions which would be material in the aggregate may exacerbate the risks inherent with our growth strategy such as i an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models ii unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions that may impact our results of operations for a period iii increased demands on our cash resources that may among other things impact our ability to explore other opportunities iv undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover v increased vulnerability to general economic conditions vi an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships vii additional expenses and exposure to new regulatory political and economic risks if such acquisitions were in new jurisdictions and viii diversion of managerial attention 

we may not successfully integrate acquired towers into our operations 

as part of our growth strategy we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions the process of integrating any acquired towers into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and large expenditures and may absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development of our business it may also result in the loss of key customers andor personnel and expose us to unanticipated liabilities these risks may be exacerbated in those circumstances in which we acquire a material number of towers further we may not be able to retain the key employees that may be necessary to operate the business we acquire and we may not be able to timely attract new skilled employees and management to replace them there can be no assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquisitions into our existing business 

  

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and deployment of 4g has been limited to date additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

 we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of 

  

this competition margins in this segment continue to be under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

the documents governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

the indentures governing the 825 notes the 575 notes and the 5625 notes the senior credit agreement and the secured tower revenue securities contain restrictive covenants imposing significant operational and financial restrictions on us including restrictions that may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our longterm best interests among other things the covenants under each indenture limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

 we are required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior credit agreement the senior credit agreement requires sba senior finance ii and sbacc to maintain specific financial ratios including at the sba senior finance ii level 1 a ratio of consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda not to exceed 60 times for any fiscal quarter 2 a ratio of consolidated total debt and net hedge exposure calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement to annualized borrower ebitda for the most recently ended fiscal quarter not to exceed 60 times for 30 consecutive days and 3 a ratio of annualized borrower ebitda to annualized cash interest expense calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement of not less than 20 times for any fiscal quarter in addition sbacc’s ratio of consolidated total net debt to consolidated adjusted ebitda calculated in accordance with the senior credit agreement for any fiscal quarter on an annualized basis cannot exceed 95 times 

additionally the mortgage loan relating to our tower securities contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our debt instruments if any default occurs all amounts outstanding under our outstanding notes and the senior credit agreement may become immediately due and payable 

  

our variable rate indebtedness and refinancing obligations subject us to interest rate risk which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 

fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under the revolving credit facility and term loans or upon refinancing our fixed rate debt as a result we are exposed to interest rate risk if interest rates were to increase our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows including cash available for servicing our indebtedness will correspondingly decrease there is no guarantee that any future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness in the future we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility however we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant assets are and are expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the tower securities the 825 notes the 575 notes the term loans and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and president—international thomas p hunt our senior vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our senior vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the federal aviation administration “faa” and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with 

  

environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” 

  

in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

  

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of our convertible notes could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 







 item 2 properties 

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 103000 square feet of office space in multiple buildings these leases expire at different dates extending through february 28 2022 we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements licenses rightsofway and other similar interests for the quarter ended december 31 2012 approximately 70 of our tower sites were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have an interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control has been extended to 31 years in rural areas a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10000 square foot tract which supports towers equipment shelters and related equipment less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications tower sites land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own and operate towers in canada central america and south america our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed approximately 974 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2012 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2012 we owned 17491 tower sites the majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 4800 actual or potential communications sites approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2012 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada central america and south america site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile digicel claro and telefonica wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five to ten years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central and south america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods in central america we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada while our leases in south america typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 34 annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15 of the 17491 tower sites we owned as of december 31 2012 approximately 70 were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold or other interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 21 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

  

  

 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by 1 adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications and 2 executing monetary amendments as wireless service providers upgrade their equipment furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue 

  

site development services 

our site development business which is conducted in the united states only is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our services include 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits 6 tower and related site construction 7 antenna installation and 8 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance 

for information regarding our operating segments see note 21 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

international operations 

as of december 31 2012 we had operations in canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua panama and brazil our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to expand operations through new builds and acquisitions tenant leases in the canadian market typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states with an initial term of five years and specific rent escalators tenant leases in central america and brazil typically have a ten year initial term tenant leases in central america typically have similar renewal terms and rent escalators as those in the united states and canada while those in brazil are based on a standard cost of living index 

in our central american markets significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically our ground leases our tenant leases and most of our tower related expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in our canadian and brazilian operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in local currency 

  

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2012 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five to ten years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

on october 31 2011 we entered into a master amendment with one of our wireless service provider customers the master amendment serves as a separate amendment to each individual existing tenant lease agreement that we are currently a party to with that customer among other items the master amendment 1 extends the current term of the individual leases 2 permits the customer limited early termination rights which will be exercisable over a multiyear period commencing in the second half of 2013 on a specific number of the existing leases 3 allows the customer to make certain specific equipment changes at the tower sites in exchange for an increase in monthly rental payment due from the customer and 4 slightly modifies the existing monthly lease rates of certain leases the customer’s early termination rights are limited with respect to the aggregate 

  

number of leases that may be terminated and the number that may be terminated in any quarter the specific leases to be terminated early and the timing of such terminations has not been determined as of the date of this filing as a result for accounting and financial statement purposes we have made assumptions with regard to the leases to be terminated and the timing of the terminations we have assumed that the customer will terminate the maximum number of leases allowable in each quarter selecting the highest rental rate leases at the earliest allowable dates we believe that these assumptions will ensure that only the minimum known revenue for the pool of leases covered by the master agreement will be accrued on a straightline basis our balance sheet and statement of operations reflect these assumptions the actual leases that the customer terminates and the timing and number of terminations may or may not be those that we have identified in our assumptions we will monitor actual results and elections under the master amendment and record any differences from previously made assumptions on a quarterly basis to the extent that the actual results materially differ from the assumptions made we will disclose the impact of these adjustments 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience specific customer collection issues identified and past due balances as determined based on contractual terms interest is charged on outstanding receivables from customers on a case by case basis in accordance with the terms of the respective contracts or agreements with those customers amounts determined to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts in the period in which uncollectibility is determined to be probable 

asset impairment 

we evaluate individual longlived and related assets with finite lives for indicators of impairment to determine when an impairment analysis should be performed we evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles at the tower level which is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exists we evaluate our network location intangibles for impairment at the tower leasing business level whenever indicators of impairment are present we have established a policy to at least annually evaluate our tower assets and current contract intangibles for impairment 

we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or related assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site and related intangible estimates and assumptions inherent in the impairment evaluation include but are not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for the purpose of calculating the amount of an impairment charge 

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

  

key performance indicators 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including segment operating profit and adjusted ebitda information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures 

segment operating profit 

we believe that segment operating profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation accretion and amortization which is largely fixed and noncash in nature segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 1728 million in 2012 is primarily due to additional profit generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2011 and during the year ended december 31 2012 organic site leasing growth from new leases contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 681 million in 2011 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the revenues from the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2010 and subsequent to december 31 2010 organic site leasing growth from new leases contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended december 31 2011 control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

the increase in site development segment operating profit of 66 million in 2012 is primarily due to the higher volume of work performed compared to the prior year associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including sprint’s network vision initiative 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments the reconciliation of segment operating profit is as follows 

 

   

 adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other charges noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related expenses noncash straightline leasing revenue noncash straightline ground lease expense and income from discontinued operations 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit agreement 825 notes 5625 notes and 575 notes adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap 

the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

 

  

    

adjusted ebitda was 5879 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to 4449 million for the year ended december 31 2011 the increase of 1430 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing and site development segments offset partially by the increase in our cash selling general and administrative expenses 

adjusted ebitda was 4449 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 3874 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase of 575 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment 

  

results of operations 

year ended 2012 compared to year ended 2011 

 

 revenues 

site leasing revenue increased 2298 million for the year ended december 31 2012 largely due to i revenues from towers acquired in the latter half of fiscal year 2011 and during the year ended december 31 2012 including 1257 million of additional revenue from the mobilitie and towerco acquisitions ii towers constructed in the latter half of 2011 and during the year ended december 31 2012 iii organic site leasing growth from new leases contractual rent escalators with current tenants and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers and iv increased straightline leasing revenue associated with the sprint network vision agreement entered into in the fourth quarter of 2011 and the master lease amendment entered into with tmobile in september 2012 

  

site development revenue increased 261 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the year ended december 31 2011 as a result of a higher volume of work performed during 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including sprint’s network vision initiative 

operating expenses 

site leasing cost of revenues increased 57 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us including 313 million the majority of which is reimbursable to us from the mobilitie towers acquired in the second quarter and 179 million from the towerco towers acquired in the fourth quarter 

site development cost of revenues increased 196 million for the year ended december 31 2012 as compared to the prior year due to a higher volume of work performed during 2012 as compared to 2011 associated with the deployment of next generation networks by wireless carriers including sprint’s network vision initiative

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts in the united states canada and central america site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless tmobile digicel claro and telefonica wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site in the united states and canada our tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases in our central america markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5year renewal periods and similar rent escalators to that of leases in the united states and canada 

we expand our tower portfolio both domestically and internationally through the construction of new towers or new builds and through the acquisition of towers from third parties in our new build program we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants during 2012 we intend to build between 415 and 435 new towers domestically and internationally 

in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower sites portfolio over the past three years 

 

  

 as of december 31 2011 we had an average of 23 tenants per tower 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit our site leasing business generated 883 of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2011 and has represented 974 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years for the year ended december 31 2011 site leasing revenues generated outside the us and its territories were less than 4 of total revenue 

international operations 

we believe that we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a highgrowth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environment we currently own 1330 towers in canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama and intend to continue expanding in these and other international markets these international markets typically have less mature wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and wireless data penetration accordingly our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by i wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their networks in developing countries ii consumers’ increased use of high data applications such as email internet access and video and iii recent spectrum auctions which have resulted in new market entrants as well as initial data network deployments for example we expect a meaningful buildout of our new towers and communication sites in costa rica as a result of recent spectrum auctions in that country we expect to continue expanding internationally through buying or building towers managing communication sites and leasing space to wireless service providers on assets we control 

we consider various factors when identifying a market for our international expansion including 

 

  

  

   

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business is conducted in the united states only and consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also identify new business opportunities and provide market intelligence for our leasing and new tower build functions 

we provide our site development consulting and construction services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry overview 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video successful spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication sites the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

 

  

  

   

despite the recent recessionary conditions affecting the global marketplace based on these factors we believe that the us wireless industry will continue to grow and is wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio  during 2012 we intend to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through the consummation of the mobilitie transaction additional tower acquisitions and the construction of between 415 to 435 new towers in connection with our international expansion we have targeted select international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communication industrywe intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios furthermore we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience we are a large owner operator and developer of tower and other communication sites with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing communication sites for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated tower sites for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our 

  

cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future for the quarter ended december 31 2011 approximately 700 of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control has been extended to 33 years 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this expertise internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

 during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

   

sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing and sales efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and local office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

competition 

site leasing – our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation crown castle international and global tower partners 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers as a result of several large mergers and acquisitions american tower and crown castle have substantially more towers and greater financial resources than we do wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business internationally to date the competition we have encountered has been from both independent tower companies and wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks in our markets outside the us and its territories the majority of existing towers are owned by wireless service providers 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including bechtel corporation black  veatch corporation goodman networks general dynamics corporation and nsoro the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway 

  

consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2011 we had 814 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement of these 814 employees 87 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on 

  

applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international  regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or 

  

government agencies prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2011 we had 251 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases will contractually provide for approximately 51 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2010 we had 253 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 49 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2011 we had approximately 145 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 178 million as of december 31 2010

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers if our wireless service provider customers continue to consolidate as a result of among other factors limited wireless spectrum for commercial use in the us this consolidation could significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that our wireless service provider customers require to expand their networks which could materially and adversely affect our future operating results 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks certain wireless carriers that currently own nationwide spectrum positions have announced the intention to build nationwide networks but have also announced that they do not have all of the necessary financing in place to complete such networks in addition our wireless service customers have engaged in increased use of network sharing roaming or resale arrangements as a result of all of the above wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2010 and 2011 

 

 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts when due subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

  

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our revolving credit facility and term loan and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue and the loss consolidation or financial instability of any of our significant customers may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers the loss of any one of our significant customers as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

  

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

 we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

  

  

 revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for the land under our towers which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators and our competitors which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms or at all our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers to the extent that we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers it could require us to incur additional expenses before we can operate and generate revenue from such tower 

our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position 

our current business operations in canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were less than 4 during the year ended december 31 2011 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations will grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the majority of our international operations are denominated in united states dollars however for some of our international operations we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

  

our convertible note hedge transactions may not cover all of the potential dilution or additional cash outlay if we settled the notes in cash to which we may be subject upon conversion of the notes 

concurrently with the pricing of our 1875 convertible senior notes due 2013 the “1875 notes” and our 40 convertible senior notes due 2014 the “40 notes” we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1875 notes is 4146 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of our 1875 convertible notes and the upper strike price of the warrants is 6737 per share the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 40 convertible notes is 3038 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 40 notes and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is 4464 per share pursuant to the terms of the warrant transaction we are responsible for the dilution or costs to the extent that we settle in cash or stock arising from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants during 2011 we purchased an aggregate of 150 million in principal amount of the 1875 notes and 5350 million remained outstanding if the market price of our class a common stock significantly exceeded either of these strike prices on their respective conversion dates we would be subject to material dilution or to the extent we elected to settle in cash material additional costs 

initially we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes and the 40 notes however as a result of the bankruptcy of lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction that we had entered into with lehman derivatives the terminated convertible note hedge transaction had originally covered 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1875 notes consequently we do not currently have a hedge with respect to that percentage of the shares issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds 4146 per share upon conversion of the notes we will be subject to dilution or if we settle in cash additional costs upon conversion of that portion of the 1875 notes if any of the other counterparties to our convertible hedge transactions were to default in their obligations then our potential dilution or costs upon conversion of the respective notes would be materially increased 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam 

  

forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space any increase in the amount of wireless traffic moved by carriers away from macro antenna sites to small cell architecture distributed antenna systems wifi or other alternate distribution methods could adversely affect the demand for our tower space if any of these or other new technologies are widely adopted in the future it could have a material adverse effect on our growth and results of operations 

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio long term 

we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through the consummation of the mobilitie transaction additional tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in any given year if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and deployment of 4g has been limited to date additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

our acquisition initiatives may disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

during 2012 we expect to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally through the consummation of the mobilitie transaction additional tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers our ability to grow through acquisitions will depend in part on the availability of suitable acquisitions at an acceptable price our ability to compete effectively for towers and the availability of capital and personnel to complete such acquisitions and effectively integrate acquired towers into our business these risks could be heightened if we complete a large acquisition such as our pending mobilitie acquisition or several smaller acquisitions within a relatively short period of time furthermore large acquisitions may raise additional risks as we are required to place enhanced reliance on the financial and operational representations and warranties of sellers our acquisition strategy subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including an adverse impact on our overall profitability if the acquired towers do not achieve the financial results projected in our valuation models unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions undisclosed and assumed liabilities that we may be unable to recover an adverse impact on our existing customer relationships and the diversion of managerial attention due to an acquisition if we are not able to successfully execute on our acquisition strategy our future tower portfolio growth and therefore our future financial results could be adversely impacted 

  

our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel as well as those risks described above in “—our international operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates” furthermore the success of our international operations is subject to a number of uncertainties including our ability to compete internationally with tower companies or wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and that in some cases have been in the international market for a longer period of time although we generally focus our international efforts in countries with relatively stable political and macroeconomic environments growing competitive wireless communications industries and multiple wireless carriers that are likely to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs to us we are subject to several factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our expansion initiatives will succeed and not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers sometimes have alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

 we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly or limit the acquisition opportunities altogether any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment continue to be under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

  

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

our credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under the credit agreement in addition if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness including under our 2010 tower securities and our notes then such default could cause a crossdefault under our credit agreement 

the mortgage loan relating to our 2010 tower securities also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130x or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130x for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115x as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115x for a calendar quarter as lease payments from 3670 tower sites of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan if this cash flow was not available to us it could adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the 2010 tower securities the 2016 notes the 2019 notes the term loan and any amounts that we may borrow under the revolving credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the 

  

cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our president – international thomas p hunt our senior vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our senior vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the federal aviation administration “faa” and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  

to the extent that we are not able to meet our contractual obligations to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to meet our contractual obligations to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law provide for antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future in addition us federal state and local as well as international tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from rf energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of 

  

substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 







 item 2 properties 

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 73000 square feet of office space this lease expires february 28 2022 we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business we believe our existing facilities are adequate for our current and planned levels of operations and that additional office space suited for our needs is reasonably available in the markets within which we operate 

our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements perpetual easements easements and licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities for the quarter ended december 31 2011 approximately 700 of our tower sites were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easements or parcels of land that have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years the average remaining life under our ground leases including renewal options under our control has been extended to 33 years in rural areas a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10000 square foot tract which supports towers equipment shelters and related equipment less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communications tower sites land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own towers in canada costa rica el salvador guatemala nicaragua and panama our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed approximately 978 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2011 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2011 we owned 10524 tower sites the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers as of december 31 2011 we also managed or leased approximately 4800 actual or potential communications sites approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2011 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless and tmobile wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 34 annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15 for the quarter ended december 31 2011 approximately 700 of our tower sites were located on parcels of land that we own land subject to perpetual easement or parcels of land in which we have a leasehold interest that extends beyond 20 years for any given tower costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the tax jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or repairing an access road or fencing 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

  

  

 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and data transfer network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue 

  

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 

our revenue from site development construction contracts is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue includes all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction contracts are recognized as incurred 

the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues contributed by site development services over the last three years for information regarding our operating segments see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

   

international operations 

as of december 31 2011 we had operations in canada costa rica el salvador nicaragua guatemala and panama our operations in these countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to expand operations through new builds and acquisitions tenant leases in the canadian market typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states with an initial term of five years and specific rent escalators tenant leases in central america typically have a ten year initial term with similar renewal terms and rent escalators as those in the united states and canada 

in our central american markets significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically our ground leases our tenant leases and most of our tower related expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our central american markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 permitting and other local fees 2 utilities and 3 taxes in our canadian operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2011 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements which are generally five years receivables recorded related to the straightlining of site leases are reflected in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets rental amounts received in advance are recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of 

  

progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents costs incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” included within other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets represents billings in excess of costs incurred and revenues recognized provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

on october 31 2011 we entered into a master amendment with one of our wireless service provider customers the master amendment serves as a separate amendment to each individual existing tenant lease agreement that we are currently a party to with that customer among other items the master amendment 1 extends the current term of the individual leases 2 permits the customer limited early termination rights which will be exercisable over a multiyear period commencing in the second half of 2013 on a specific number of the existing leases 3 allows the customer to make certain specific equipment changes at the tower sites and 4 requires increases to the monthly lease rates to be paid by the customer the customer’s early termination rights are limited with respect to the aggregate number of leases that may be terminated and the number that may be terminated in any quarter the specific leases to be terminated early and the timing of such terminations has not been determined as of the date of this filing as a result for accounting and financial statement purposes we have made assumptions with regard to the leases to be terminated and the timing of the terminations we have assumed that the customer will terminate the maximum number of leases allowable in each quarter selecting the highest rental rate leases at the earliest allowable dates we believe that these assumptions will ensure that only the minimum known revenue for the pool of leases covered by the master agreement will be accrued on a straightline basis our balance sheet and statement of operations reflect these assumptions the actual leases that the customer terminates and the timing and number of terminations may or may not be those that we have identified in our assumptions we will monitor actual results and elections under the master amendment and record any differences from previously made assumptions on a quarterly basis to the extent that the actual results materially differ from the assumptions made we will disclose the impact of these adjustments 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or intangible assets or constructioninprocess has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

  

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

  

key performance indicators 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including segment operating profit and adjusted ebitda information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures 

segment operating profit 

we believe that segment operating profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation accretion and amortization which is largely fixed and noncash in nature segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 681 million in 2011 is primarily due to additional profit generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2010 and subsequent to december 31 2010 organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 511 million in 2010 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the revenues from the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2009 and subsequent to december 31 2009 organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended december 31 2010 control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments the reconciliation of segment operating profit is as follows 

 

   

 

  

 adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other charges noncash compensation net loss from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related expenses noncash straightline leasing revenue and noncash straightline ground lease expense 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the financial performance of our core businesses adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our credit agreement and senior notes adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap 

the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

 

  

   

 adjusted ebitda was 4449 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 3874 million for the year ended december 31 2010 the increase of 575 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

 

 sources of liquidity 

we fund our growth including our tower portfolio growth through cash flows from operations longterm indebtedness and equity issuances with respect to our debt financing we have utilized secured and unsecured financings and issuances at various levels of our organizational structure to minimize our financing costs while maximizing our operational flexibility 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 2491 million for the year ended december 31 2011 as compared to 2011 million for the year ended december 31 2010 this increase was primarily due to an increase in segment operating profit from the site leasing segment partially offset by increased cash interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2011 compared to the same period in the prior year

on april 27 2011 our board of directors 1 terminated the existing 2500 million stock repurchase program under which 659 million of repurchase authorization remained available at the termination date and 2 approved a new 3000 million stock repurchase program this new program authorizes us to purchase from time to time up to 3000 million of our outstanding class a common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended andor in privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion based on market and business conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors this program became effective on april 28 2011 and will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by our board of directors at any time in their sole discretion

in order to manage our leverage and liquidity positions take advantage of market opportunities and ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions these transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity selling certain assets or lines of business issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or pursuing other financing alternatives including securitization transactions if either our debt repurchases or exchanges or any of the other financial transactions are implemented these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding increase our interest expense andor dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that we will not implement any of these strategies or that if implemented these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 

during 2012 we expect to incur nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of 120 million to 160 million including we believe less than 1000 per tower per year for nondiscretionary maintenance capital improvements in connection with our previously announced acquisition of mobilitie we expect to incur approximately 850 million of discretionary cash capital expenditures which we expect to fund from cash on hand existing credit facilities and 500 million in new financing commitments in addition to the mobilitie transaction we expect to have discretionary cash capital expenditures during 2012 primarily associated with new tower construction additional tower acquisitions tower augmentations and ground lease purchases we expect to fund these additional cash capital expenditures from cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility the exact amount of our future cash capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and tower acquisition programs and our ground lease purchase program 

we estimate we will incur less than 1000 per tower per year for nondiscretionary maintenance capital improvements related to our towers we expect to fund cash capital expenditures from cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and tower acquisition programs and our ground lease purchase program

any calendar quarter falls to 130x or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130x for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115x as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115x for a calendar quarter the mortgage loan agreement as amended also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets as of december 31 2011 the borrowers met the required debt service coverage ratio based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2011 debt service for the next twelve months on the 2010 tower securities would be 574 million

1875 convertible senior notes – on may 16 2008 we issued 5500 million of our 1875 notes interest is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 the maturity date of the 1875 notes is may 1 2013 the 1875 notes are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of 241196 shares of class a common stock per 1000 principal amount of 1875 notes subject to certain customary adjustments which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 4146 per share or a 20 conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of 3455 per share of class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market on may 12 2008 the purchase agreement date 

concurrently with the pricing of the 1875 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions covering 13265780 shares of our class a common stock at an initial price of 4146 per share the same as the initial conversion price of the 1875 notes separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 1875 notes we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire 13265780 shares of our class a common stock at an initial exercise price of 6737 per share the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions taken as a whole effectively increase the conversion price of the 1875 notes from 4146 per share to 6737 per share as we cannot determine when or whether the 1875 notes will be converted the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions taken as a whole minimize the dilution risk associated with early conversion of the 1875 notes until such time that our class a common stock is trading at a price above 6737 per share the upper strike of the warrants 

one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the 1875 notes was with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives covered 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes in october 2008 lehman derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the filing by lehman derivatives of a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy petition constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives as a result on november 7 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives based on information available to us we have no indication as of the date of filing this form 10k that any party other than lehman derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions 

the net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital and therefore the termination of the convertible note hedge did not have any impact on our consolidated balance sheet however we could incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction if we elect to do so if we do not elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction then we will be subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the 1875 notes if on the date of conversion the per share market price of our class a common stock exceeds the conversion price of 4146 

  

at december 31 2011 we had  5350 million outstanding of 1875 notes which were recorded at a carrying value of  4850 million based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2011 debt service for the next twelve months on the 1875 notes will be approximately 100 million 

40 convertible senior notes – on april 24 2009 we issued 5000 million of our 40 notes in a private placement transaction interest on the 40 notes is payable semiannually on april 1 and october 1 the maturity date of the 40 notes is october 1 2014 the 40 notes are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of 329164 shares of our class a common stock per 1000 principal amount of 40 notes subject to certain customary adjustments which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 3038 per share or a 225 conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of 2480 per share of our class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market on april 20 2009 the purchase agreement date 

concurrently with the pricing of the 40 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we purchased from affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 40 notes an option covering 16458196 shares of our class a common stock at an initial price of 3038 per share the same as the initial conversion price of the notes separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 40 notes we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold to affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 40 notes warrants to acquire 16458196 shares of our class a common stock at an initial exercise price of 4464 per share we used approximately 616 million of the net proceeds from the 40 notes offering plus the proceeds from the warrant transactions to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions taken as a whole effectively increase the conversion price of the 40 notes from 3038 per share to 4464 per share reflecting a premium of 80 based on the closing stock price of 2480 per share of our class a common stock on april 20 2009 if the market price of our class a common stock exceeded the upper strike price of 4464 per share on the conversion date of the 40 notes then we will be subject to dilution or cost upon conversion of the 40 notes the remaining net proceeds of 3766 million were used for general corporate purposes including repurchases or repayments of our outstanding debt 

as of december 31 2011 we had outstanding  5000 million of our 40 notes with a carrying value of  3976 million based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2011 debt service for the next twelve months on the 40 notes would be approximately 200 million

inflation 

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own towers in canada costa rica el salvador and panama our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed 975 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2010 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space primarily to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2010 we owned 9111 tower sites the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also managed or leased approximately 5300 actual or potential communications sites approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2010 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless and tmobile wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3 per year including the renewal option periods 

in our new build program we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants during 2011 we intend to build at least 390 to 410 new towers domestically and internationally 

in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower sites portfolio over the past three years 

 

  

  as of december 31 2010 we had an average of 24 tenants per tower 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit our site leasing business generated 854 of our total revenues during the year ended december 31 2010 and has represented 974 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years for the year ended december 31 2010 site leasing revenues generated outside the us and its territories was less than 1 of total revenue 

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions 

we provide our site development consulting and construction services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

  

industry overview 

we believe that growing wireless traffic particularly data and video the successful spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication sites the following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry 

 

  

  

 despite the recent recessionary conditions affecting the global marketplace based on these factors we believe that the us wireless industry will continue to grow and is wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

we believe that the international wireless markets in which we currently operate will continue to present growth opportunities for the wireless communications industry as these markets are anticipated to need new towers and communication sites these markets also typically have limited but quickly growing wireline infrastructure and limited wireless data penetration further some countries such as costa rica have recently had spectrum auctions that we expect will result in a meaningful buildout of new towers and communication sites we intend to participate in such activity in these markets through buying or building towers managing communication sites and leasing space to wireless service providers on assets we control 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our 

  

towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio  during 2011 we intend to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally by 5 to 10 in connection with our international expansion we have targeted international markets that we believe have relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communication industry we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios furthermore we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

capitalizing on our scale and management experience  we are a large owner operator and developer of tower and other communication sites with substantial capital human and operating resources we have been developing communication sites for wireless service providers in the us since 1989 and owned and operated tower sites for ourselves since 1997 we believe our size experience capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for wireless service providers both in the us and internationally our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2010 we owned or controlled for a minimum period of fifty years land under 311 of our communication sites 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships we are seeking to replicate this expertise internationally due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large us wireless service providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

  

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

  

   during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

  

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing and sales efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and local office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

competition 

site leasing – our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies including american tower corporation crown castle international and global tower partners 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past five years specifically american tower completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our acquisition of aat communications corporation in 2006 and crown castle completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle have substantially more towers and greater financial resources than we do wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business internationally to date the competition we have encountered has been from both independent tower companies and wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks in our markets outside the us and its territories the majority of existing towers are owned by wireless service providers 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the us site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including bechtel corporation black  veatch corporation goodman networks general dynamics corporation nsoro and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project currently we do not offer site development services in markets outside of the us and its territories 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2010 we had 720 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement of these 720 employees 47 were based outside of the us and its territories we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa 

  

requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

  

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

international – regulatory regimes outside of the us and its territories vary by country and locality however these regulations typically require tower owners andor licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or the addition of a new antenna to an existing tower based on our experience to date these regimes have been similar to but not more rigorous burdensome or comprehensive than those in the us our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters as we expand our operations into additional international geographic areas we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2010 we had 253 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases will contractually provide for approximately 49 million of annual revenue by comparison as of december 31 2009 we had 344 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 76 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2010 we had approximately 178 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 139 million as of december 31 2009

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar for example in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel the combined companies have rationalized and may continue to rationalize duplicative parts of their networks which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers furthermore to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as much space on our towers in the future if these consolidations significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that the wireless service providers require to expand their network our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2009 and 2010 

 

 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts when due subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our 2010 credit facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers the loss of any one of our significant customers as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

   

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

  

   revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space new technologies including “small cell” technologies that reduce the need for large antenna or “macro configurations” could reduce our customers need to lease space on our communication sites traditional macrosite installations currently are the source and are expected to continue to be the source of substantially all our site leasing revenue 

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates 

our current business operations in canada costa rica el salvador and panama and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not typically experienced in the united states although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were immaterial during the year ended december 31 2010 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future accordingly our business is and will in the future be subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 the majority of our international operations are denominated in united states dollars however for some of our international operations we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

our convertible note hedge transactions may not cover all of the potential dilution or additional cash outlay if we settled the notes in cash to which we may be subject upon conversion of the notes 

concurrently with the pricing of our 1875 convertible senior notes due 2013 the “1875 notes” and our 40 convertible senior notes due 2014 the “40 notes” we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1875 notes is 4146 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of our 1875 convertible notes and the upper strike price of the warrants is 6737 per share the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 40 convertible notes is 3038 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 40 notes and the upper strike price of the warrant transactions is 4464 per share 

initially we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions to cover the full amount of the shares that were issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes and the 40 notes however as a result of the global economic conditions in 2008 lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” a counterparty to one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1875 notes filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code as a result on november 7 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives which covered 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1875 notes consequently we do not currently have a hedge with respect to those shares and to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds 4146 per share upon conversion of the notes we will be subject to dilution or if we settle in cash additional costs upon conversion of that portion of the 1875 notes if any of the other counterparties to our convertible hedge transactions were to default in their obligations then our potential dilution or costs upon conversion of the respective notes would be materially increased 

pursuant to the terms of the warrant transaction we are responsible for the dilution or costs to the extent that we settle in cash or stock arising from the conversion of the notes to the extent that the market price of our class a common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants the strike price for the warrants covering 45 of the 1875 notes is 6737 per share and the strike price for the warrants covering the 40 notes is 4464 per share as of february 17 2011 the closing sales price of our class a common stock was 4366 per share if the market price of our class a common stock significantly exceeded either of these strike prices on their respective conversion dates we would be subject to material dilution or to the extent we elected to settle in cash material additional costs 

  

increasing competition may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio longterm 

we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5 to 10 annually domestically and internationally through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

we currently intend to build at least 390 to 410 new towers domestically and internationally during 2011 however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits furthermore with respect to our international new builds our tower construction may be delayed or halted as a result of local zoning restrictions inconsistencies between laws or other barriers to construction in international markets 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2011 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could materially and adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services regardless of consumer demand each wireless service customer must have substantial capital resources and capabilities to build out their wireless networks two wireless carriers that currently own nationwide spectrum positions have announced the intention to build nationwide networks but have also announced that they do not have all of the necessary financing in place to complete such networks as a result of all of the above wireless carriers may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition other factors affecting the demand for our communication sites include 

 

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g 4g or other wireless services or worse elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if wireless service provider demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

  

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and deployment of 4g has been limited to date additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

our expansion initiatives may disrupt our operations or expose us to additional risk 

as we continue to acquire communications sites in our existing markets and expand into new markets we are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including not meeting our return on investment criteria and financial objectives increased costs undisclosed and assumed liabilities and the diversion of managerial attention due to an acquisition acquisitions involve substantial operating and financial risks and no assurance can be given as to our future success in identifying executing and integrating acquisitions our international expansion initiatives are subject to additional risks such as complex laws regulations and business practices that may require additional resources and personnel as well as those risks described above in “—our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates” furthermore we began expanding our operations internationally relatively recently and the success of our international operations is subject to a number of uncertainties including our ability to compete internationally with tower companies or wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks that have been in the international market for a longer period of time although we generally focus our international efforts in countries with relatively stable political and macroeconomic environments growing competitive wireless communications industries and multiple wireless carriers that are likely to outsource their communications site infrastructure needs to us we are subject to several factors outside of our control and no assurance can be given that our expansion initiatives will succeed and not materially and adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition 

  

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 us and international wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

 we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment continue to be under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway from time to time we experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for the land under our towers which can affect our ability to access and operate such towers further landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

in addition we may not always have the ability to analyze and verify all information regarding title access and other issues regarding the land underlying acquired towers to the extent that we do not have complete access to or use of the land underlying the acquired towers it could require us to incur additional expenses before we can operate and generate revenue from such tower 

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

our 2010 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit our ability to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

 these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under the 2010 credit facility in addition if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness including under our 2010 tower securities and our notes then such default could cause a crossdefault under our 2010 credit facility 

the mortgage loan relating to our 2010 tower securities also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage ratio as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130x or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130x for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115x as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115x for a calendar quarter as lease payments from 3683 tower sites of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan if this cash flow was not available to us it could adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business  

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the 2010 tower securities the 2016 notes the 2019 notes and any amounts that we may borrow under the 2010 credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

  

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our president  international thomas p hunt our senior vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our senior vice president and chief financial officer we do not have 

  

employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both in the us and internationally in the us both the federal aviation administration “faa” and the fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

to the extent that we are not able to provide wireless services to our customers due to a natural disaster or other catastrophic circumstances our customers may not be obligated or willing to pay their lease expenses however we would be required to continue paying our fixed expenses related to the affected tower including ground lease expenses if we are unable to provide wireless services to our customers for a material portion of our towers our operations could be materially and adversely affected 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders we adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a 

  

taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our deferred tax assets which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

the us government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the federal communications commission the “fcc” the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services 

  

moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the united states and its territories in addition we own towers in canada costa rica el salvador and panama our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed approximately 975 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2010 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2010 we owned 9111 tower sites the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers as of december 31 2010 we also managed or leased approximately 5300 actual or potential communications sites approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2010 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint verizon wireless and tmobile wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing lastly ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3 annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15 

as indicated in the table below our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit for information regarding our operating segments see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

  

  

 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal nondiscretionary capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low tenant lease terminations as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development services business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue 

  

and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development services business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 

our revenue from site development construction contracts is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue includes all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction contracts are recognized as incurred 

the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues contributed by site development services over the last three years for information regarding our operating segments see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

 international operations 

as of december 31 2010 we had operations in canada costa rica el salvador and panama our operations in these four countries are solely in the site leasing business and we expect to expand operations through new 

  

builds and acquisitions tenant leases and ground leases in these international markets typically have similar terms and conditions as those in the united states with a fixed initial term of three to five years and specific rent escalators 

in our central american markets significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities are denominated in us dollars specifically our ground leases our tenant leases and most of our tower related expenses are due and paid in us dollars in our canadian operations significantly all of our revenue expenses and capital expenditures arising from our new build activities including tenant leases ground leases and other towerrelated expenses are denominated in canadian dollars in each of these markets our local currency obligations are principally limited to 1 salaries and other employee benefits 2 permitting and other local fees 3 utilities and 4 taxes however in some of our central american markets a portion of these expenses may also be paid in us dollars 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2010 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

construction revenue 

revenue from construction projects is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

  

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or intangible assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

key performance indicators 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including segment operating profit and adjusted ebitda information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures 

segment operating profit 

we believe that segment operating profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation accretion and amortization which is largely fixed and noncash in nature segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

 

   

the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 511 million in 2010 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the revenues from the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2009 or subsequent to december 31 2009 organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended december 31 2010 control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 658 million in 2009 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the revenues from the towers that we acquired in the 2008 acquisitions of optasite light tower and tower co and other towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2008 or subsequent to december 31 2008 organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended december 31 2009 control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments the reconciliation of segment operating profit is as follows 

 

   

adjusted ebitda 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our 2010 credit facility as defined below and senior notes as defined below adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses including amortization of deferred financing fees provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other charges noncash compensation net loss gain from extinguishment of debt other income and expenses acquisition related expenses noncash straightline leasing revenue and noncash straightline ground lease expense adjusted ebitda excludes acquisition related costs which were previously capitalized but commencing january 1 2009 were required to be expensed and included within operating expenses pursuant to the adoption of new business combination accounting guidance the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

 

  

  adjusted ebitda was 3874 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 3385 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the increase of 489 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment 

adjusted ebitda was 3385 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2692 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase of 693 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment 

  

results of operations 

year ended 2010 compared to year ended 2009 

 

 revenues 

site leasing revenue increased 584 million for the year ended december 31 2010 largely due to i revenues from the towers that we acquired or constructed in the latter half of 2009 or subsequent to december 31 2009 and ii organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators with current tenants and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers 

  

site development consulting revenue increased 18 million and site development construction revenues increased 109 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 as a result of a higher volume of work associated with continued network expansion of the wireless carriers 

operating expenses 

site leasing cost of revenues increased 73 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us which was 9111 at december 31 2010 up from 8324 at december 31 2009 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

site development consulting cost of revenues increased 17 million and site development construction cost of revenues increased 99 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year as a result of a higher volume of work performed during 2010 as compared to 2009 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 54 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees increased noncash compensation expense as well as costs incurred in connection with our international expansion 

acquisition related expenses increased 53 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the prior year primarily as a result of an increase in the number of towers acquired as well as under contract for acquisition during 2010 as compared to 2009 

we recognized an asset impairment charge of 59 million for the year ended december 31 2010 and 39 million for the year ended december 31 2009 these asset impairment charges resulted from a reevaluation of i future cash flow expectations using a discounted cash flow analysis for those towers 59 towers in 2010 and 21 towers in 2009 that have not achieved expected leaseup results compared to ii the related net book value of those towers in addition the asset impairment charge for 2009 included an impairment charge on our six das networks based on their estimated fair value at december 31 2009 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 202 million to 2787 million for the year ended december 31 2010 from 2585 million for the year ended december 31 2009 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets owned for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to those owned at december 31 2009 

operating income 

operating income increased 193 million for year ended december 31 2010 to 743 million compared to 550 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the result of higher segment operating profit in the site leasing segment partially offset by increases in depreciation accretion and amortization expense acquisition related expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

other income expense 

interest income decreased 07 million for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of the lower weighted average interest rates during 2010 compared to 2009 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 191 million from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding offset by the lower weighted average interest rate for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to the year ended december 31 2009 

  

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2010 increased 102 million from the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of accretion of debt discounts using the effective interest method on the 1875 notes the 40 notes and the senior notes offset by the impact of the repurchase of an aggregate of 1077 million in principal of the 0375 notes during 2009 and repayment of the optasite credit facility in july 2009 

the loss from extinguishment of debt of 491 million for the year ended december 31 2010 is primarily associated with the repayment of the outstanding balance of 9386 million in principal of our 2006 cmbs certificates the net loss from extinguishment of debt of 57 million for the year ended december 31 2009 includes a loss of 72 million related to the repurchases and subsequent payoff of our 2005 cmbs certificates in july 2009 27 million associated with the repurchase of 1501 million in principal of our 2006 cmbs certificates and 19 million related to the payoff of our optasite credit facility in july 2009 offset by a gain of 61 million associated with the repurchases of an aggregate of 1077 million in principal of our 0375 notes 

net loss 

net loss was 1944 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 1411 million for the year ended december 31 2009 the net loss increased in 2010 primarily due to the loss on extinguishment of debt of 491 million increases in interest expense noncash interest expense and depreciation accretion and amortization expense partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit 

  

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

 

 revenues 

site leasing revenue increased 815 million for the year ended december 31 2009 largely due to i revenues from the towers that we acquired in the 2008 acquisitions of optasite light tower and tower co and the other towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2008 and ii organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers average rents per tenant increased in the year ended december 31 2009 due primarily to rent escalators lease amendments and higher rents associated with new leases 

site development consulting revenue decreased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a lower volume of work site development construction revenues remained relatively stable for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

  

operating expenses 

site leasing cost of revenues increased 157 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us which was 8324 at december 31 2009 up from 7854 at december 31 2008 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

site development consulting cost of revenues decreased by 20 million and site development construction cost of revenues decreased by 13 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of lower volume of work and continued effort to manage and reduce fixed overhead costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 41 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees and increased noncash compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

acquisition related expenses of 48 million are associated with acquisitions which effective january 1 2009 are required to be expensed and included within operating expenses we had historically capitalized the majority of these expenses 

asset impairment of 39 million for the year ended december 31 2009 is a result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for 21 towers that have not achieved expected leaseup results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower assets and an impairment charge on our six das networks based on the estimated fair value of the das networks at december 31 2009 asset impairment of 09 million for the year ended december 31 2008 is a result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for 8 towers that have not achieved expected leaseup results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower asset and related intangibles 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 471 million to 2585 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 2114 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to those owned at december 31 2008 

operating income 

operating income increased 94 million for year ended december 31 2009 to 550 million compared to 456 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the result of higher segment operating profit in the site leasing segment partially offset by increases in depreciation accretion and amortization expense acquisition related expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

other income expense 

interest income decreased 58 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of lower weighted average interest rates offset by higher average invested funds during 2009 compared to 2008 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 255 million from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the higher interest rates on the mix of our outstanding debt and the higher weighted average amount of cash interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

  

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 166 million from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of the accretion of debt discounts on the senior notes which were issued in july 2009 and the 40 notes which were issued in april 2009 and the optasite credit facility acquired in september 2008 offset by the impact of the repurchase of an aggregate of 3196 million in principal of the 0375 notes in the fourth quarter of 2008 and year ended december 31 2009 

the net loss from extinguishment of debt of 57 million for the year ended december 31 2009 includes a loss of 72 million related to the repurchases and subsequent payoff of our 2005 cmbs certificates in july 2009 27 million associated with the repurchase of 1501 million in principal of our 2006 cmbs certificates and 19 million related to the payoff of our optasite credit facility in july 2009 offset by a gain of 61 million associated with the repurchases of an aggregate of 1077 million in principal of our 0375 notes the net gain from extinguishment of debt of 443 million for the year ended december 31 2008 included 257 million related to the repurchase of 2119 million in principal amount of our 0375 notes and 189 million related to the repurchases of 655 million of our cmbs certificates offset by the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under the senior credit facility as a result of lehman commercial paper inc’s default of its funding obligations see discussion in note 12 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

other income expense for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 136 million from the year ended december 31 2008 primarily as a result of an otherthantemporary impairment charge on our investments in auction rate securities during 2008 see note 4 of our consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this otherthantemporary impairment charge 

net loss 

net loss increased by 740 million to 1411 million for the year ended december 31 2009 primarily as a result of the 2009 net losses from the early extinguishment of debt as opposed to net gains from the early extinguishment of debt in 2008 increases in interest expense noncash interest expense and depreciation accretion and amortization expense partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit

cash provided by operating activities was 2012 million for the year ended december 31 2010 as compared to 2226 million for the year ended december 31 2009 this decrease was primarily due to the timing of interest payments relating to the higher average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2010 compared to the same period in the prior year offset by an increase in segment operating profit from the site leasing segment 

on february 11 2010 sba senior finance ii llc “sba senior finance ii” our indirect whollyowned subsidiary entered into a credit agreement for a 5000 million senior secured revolving credit facility the “2010 credit facility” with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement the “credit agreement” amounts borrowed under the 2010 credit facility are secured by a first lien on the capital stock of telecommunications sba senior finance and sba senior finance ii and substantially all of the assets other than leasehold easement or fee interests in real property of sba senior finance ii and the subsidiary guarantors as defined in the credit agreement the 2010 credit facility matures on february 11 2015 and may be borrowed repaid and redrawn subject to compliance with the financial and other covenants in the credit agreement as of december 31 2010 we had 200 million outstanding under the 2010 credit facility and the weighted average interest rate for the amounts borrowed was 215 as of december 31 2010 the availability under the 2010 credit facility was 4800 million proceeds under the 2010 credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes the material terms of the 2010 credit facility are described below under “debt instruments and debt service requirements – 2010 credit facility”

uses of liquidity 

we believe that our principal use of liquidity will be to fund tower portfolio growth and secondarily to fund our stock repurchase program in the future we may repurchase for cash or equity our outstanding indebtedness in privatelynegotiated or open market transactions in order to optimize our liquidity and leverage and take advantage of market opportunities 

our cash capital expenditures including cash used for acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2010 were 3947 million the 3947 million includes cash capital expenditures of 3031 million that we incurred primarily in connection with the acquisition of 712 completed towers net of related working capital adjustments and earnouts associated with previous acquisitions the 3947 million also includes 469 million for construction and related costs associated with the completion of 124 new towers during the year ended december 31 2010 and for the sites in process at december 31 2010 82 million for tower maintenance capital expenditures 94 million for augmentations and tower upgrades 21 million for general corporate expenditures and 250 million for ground lease purchases not including 90 million spent to extend ground lease terms 

  

subsequent to december 31 2010 we acquired 123 towers and related assets and liabilities from various sellers the aggregate consideration paid for the towers and related assets was approximately 636 million in cash 

pursuant to the terms of the indenture on or prior to november 26 2010 we received conversion notices from holders of an aggregate of 303 million in principal of our 0375 notes pursuant to section 1002 of the indenture these notes were converted at a price of 115278 per 1000 of principal or an aggregate of 349 million concurrently with the settlement of our conversion obligation we settled two convertible note hedge transactions that we had initially purchased at the time the 0375 notes were issued in connection with the settlement of these options we received an aggregate of 131 million including 85 million attributable to a portion held by our whollyowned subsidiary the remaining 120000 aggregate principal amount of 0375 notes that was not earlier converted or repurchased matured on december 1 2010 on december 1 2010 we satisfied our obligation on the notes held to maturity by paying 120000 in cash plus accrued interest 

on april 16 2010 we used the proceeds from the issuance of our 2010 tower securities to repay the remaining principal balance of 9386 million of the 2006 cmbs certificates and to pay 385 million for related prepayment consideration plus accrued interest and fees during the yeartodate period ended december 31 2010 but prior to the payoff of the principal balance we repurchased an aggregate of 20 million in principal amount of 2006 cmbs certificates for 21 million in cash 

the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective november 3 2009 this program authorizes us to purchase from time to time up to 2500 million of our outstanding class a common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities act of 1933 as amended andor in privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion based on market and business conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors this program will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by our board of directors at any time in our sole discretion during the year ended december 31 2010 we repurchased and retired approximately 3174385 shares for an aggregate of 1074 million including commissions and fees as of december 31 2010 we had a remaining authorization to repurchase an additional 1409 million of our common stock under our current 2500 million stock repurchase program 

in order to manage our leverage and liquidity positions take advantage of market opportunities and ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions these transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness the repurchase of our outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity selling certain assets or lines of business issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or pursuing other financing alternatives including securitization transactions if either our debt repurchases or exchanges or any of the other financial transactions are implemented these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding increase our interest expense andor dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that we will not implement any of these strategies or that if implemented these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 

during 2011 we expect to incur nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of 100 million to 140 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures based on current obligations of 2300 million to 2500 million primarily associated with the towers we intend to build in 2011 tower acquisitions closed or currently under contract tower augmentations and ground lease purchases we may spend additional capital in 2011 on acquiring revenue producing or expense reducing assets not yet identified and under contract or possibly stock repurchases 

we estimate we will incur less than 1000 per tower per year for nondiscretionary maintenance capital improvements related to our towers we expect to fund cash capital expenditures from cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under the 2010 credit facility the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and tower acquisition programs and our ground lease purchase program 

  

debt instruments and debt service requirements 

as of december 31 2010 we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months 

commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20061 

on november 6 2006 a new york common law trust the “trust” formed by our indirect subsidiary issued in a private transaction 115 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20061 the “2006 cmbs certificates” 

the 2006 cmbs certificates consisted of nine subclasses with annual passthrough interest rates ranging from 5314 to 7825 the weighted average annual fixed interest rate of the 2006 cmbs certificates was 59 payable monthly and the effective weighted average annual fixed interest rate was 62 after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction 

on april 16 2010 we paid off the remaining outstanding balance of 9386 million on the 2006 cmbs certificates and paid 385 million in related prepayment consideration plus accrued interest and fees 

secured tower revenue securities series 2010 

the 20101 tower securities have an annual interest rate of 4254 and the 20102 tower securities have an annual interest rate of 5101 the weighted average annual fixed coupon interest rate of the 2010 tower securities is 46 payable monthly the anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010–1 tower securities is april 16 2015 and april 16 2040 respectively the anticipated repayment date and the final maturity date for the 2010–2 tower securities is april 16 2017 and april 16 2042 respectively net proceeds from the 2010 tower securities were used to repay in full the outstanding 2006 cmbs certificates in the amount of 9386 million and pay the related prepayment consideration plus accrued interest and fees the remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

the sole asset of the trust consists of a nonrecourse mortgage loan made in favor of the borrowers the borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers which are subject to the securitization in connection with the issuance of the 2010 tower securities and the repayment of the 2006 cmbs certificates the mortgage loan components relating to the 2006 cmbs certificates were repaid and the mortgage loan was amended to create two new loan components each with terms that are identical to the series of 2010 tower securities to which it relates the borrowers are jointly and severally liable for all obligations under the mortgage loan 

the mortgage loan underlying the 2010 tower securities will be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 3683 tower sites owned by the borrowers the mortgage loan is secured by i mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on a substantial portion of the tower sites ii a security interest in substantially all of the borrowers’ personal property and fixtures iii the borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases and iv all of the proceeds of the foregoing for each calendar month sba network management inc our indirect subsidiary is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 75 of the borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month 

  

the borrowers may prepay either of the mortgage loan components in whole or in part with no prepayment consideration i within nine months of the anticipated repayment date of such mortgage loan component ii with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of any tower site owned by the borrowers or iii during an amortization period in all other circumstances the borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration the prepayment consideration is determined based on the class of 2010 tower securities to which the prepaid mortgage loan component corresponds and consists of an amount equal to the excess if any of 1 the present value associated with the portion of the principal balance being prepaid calculated in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan agreement on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date over 2 that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment 

to the extent that the mortgage loan components corresponding to the 2010 tower securities are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates the interest rate of each such component will increase by the greater of i 5 and ii the amount if any by which the sum of x the tenyear us treasury rate plus y the creditbased spread for such component as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement plus z 5 exceeds the original interest rate for such component 

pursuant to the terms of the 2010 tower securities all rents and other sums due on any of the tower sites owned by the borrowers are directly deposited by the lessees into a controlled deposit account and are held by the indenture trustee the monies held by the indenture trustee after the release date are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets however if the debt service coverage ratio defined as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers are required to pay over the succeeding twelve months as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130x or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130x for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115x as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time that the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115x for a calendar quarter the mortgage loan agreement as amended also includes covenants customary for mortgage loans subject to rated securitizations among other things the borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets as of december 31 2010 the borrowers met the required debt service coverage ratio based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2010 debt service for the next twelve months on the 2010 tower securities would be 570 million 

convertible senior notes 

0375 convertible senior notes  on march 26 2007 we issued 3500 million of our 0375 convertible senior notes the “0375 notes” interest was payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 the 0375 notes had a maturity date of december 1 2010 the 0375 notes were convertible at the holder’s option at any time between october 12 2010 and november 26 2010 into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of 297992 shares of class a common stock per 1000 principal amount of 0375 notes subject to certain customary adjustments which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 3356 per share pursuant to the terms of the indenture upon conversion we had the right to settle our conversion obligation in cash shares of class a common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our class a common stock on october 5 2010 we provided notice to the trustee and holders of our 0375 notes that we had elected to settle 100 of our conversion obligation relating to the 0375 notes in cash during the fourth quarter of 2010 we converted or repaid at maturity all outstanding 0375 notes 

  

1875 convertible senior notes  on may 16 2008 we issued 5500 million of our 1875 notes interest is payable semiannually on may 1 and november 1 the maturity date of the 1875 notes is may 1 2013 the 1875 notes are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of 241196 shares of class a common stock per 1000 principal amount of 1875 notes subject to certain customary adjustments which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 4146 per share or a 20 conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of 3455 per share of class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market on may 12 2008 the purchase agreement date 

concurrently with the pricing of the 1875 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions covering 13265780 shares of our class a common stock at an initial price of 4146 per share the same as the initial conversion price of the 1875 notes separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 1875 notes we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold warrants to each of the hedge counterparties to acquire 13265780 shares of our class a common stock at an initial exercise price of 6737 per share the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions taken as a whole effectively increase the conversion price of the 1875 notes from 4146 per share to 6737 per share as we cannot determine when or whether the 1875 notes will be converted the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions taken as a whole minimize the dilution risk associated with early conversion of the 1875 notes until such time that our class a common stock is trading at a price above 6737 per share the upper strike of the warrants 

one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with the 1875 notes was with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives covers 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of the 1875 notes in october 2008 lehman derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code the filing by lehman derivatives of a voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy petition constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives as a result on november 7 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives based on information available to us we have no indication as of the date of filing this form 10k that any party other than lehman derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions 

the net cost of the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives was recorded as an adjustment to additional paid in capital and therefore the termination of the convertible note hedge did not have any impact on our consolidated balance sheet however we could incur significant costs to replace this hedge transaction if we elect to do so if we do not elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction then we will be subject to potential dilution upon conversion of the 1875 notes if on the date of conversion the per share market price of our class a common stock exceeds the conversion price of 4146 

at december 31 2010 we had 5500 million outstanding of 1875 notes based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2010 debt service for the next twelve months on the 1875 notes will be approximately 103 million

concurrently with the pricing of the 40 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we purchased from affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 40 notes an option covering 16458196 shares of our class a common stock at an initial price of 3038 per share the same as the initial conversion price of the notes separately and concurrently with the pricing of the 40 notes we entered into warrant transactions whereby we sold to affiliates of the initial purchasers of the 40 notes warrants to acquire 16458196 shares of our class a common stock at an initial exercise price of 4464 per share we used approximately 616 million of the net proceeds from the 40 notes offering plus the proceeds from the warrant transactions to fund the cost of the convertible note hedge transactions the convertible note hedge transactions and the warrant transactions taken as a whole effectively increase the conversion price of the 40 notes from 3038 per share to 4464 per share reflecting a premium of 80 based on the closing stock price of 2480 per share of our class a common stock on april 20 2009 if the market price of our class a common stock exceeded the upper strike price of 4464 per share on the conversion date of the 40 notes then we will be subject to dilution or cost upon conversion of the 40 notes the remaining net proceeds of 3766 million were used for general corporate purposes including repurchases or repayments of our outstanding debt 

as of december 31 2010 we had outstanding 5000 million of our 40 notes based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2010 debt service for the next twelve months on the 40 notes would be approximately 200 million

the 2010 credit facility also permits us to request that one or more lenders 1 increase their proportionate share of the 2010 credit facility commitment up to an additional 2000 million in the aggregate and 2 provide sba senior finance ii term loans for an aggregate amount up to 8000 million without requesting consent of the other lenders sba senior finance ii’s ability to request such increase of the 2010 credit facility or term loans is subject to its compliance with the conditions set forth in the credit agreement including with respect to any term loan compliance on a pro forma basis with the financial covenants and ratios set forth therein upon sba senior finance ii’s request each lender may decide in its sole discretion whether to increase all or a portion of its revolving credit facility commitment or whether to provide sba senior finance ii term loans and if so upon what terms 

senior credit facility 

on january 18 2008 sba senior finance our indirect whollyowned subsidiary entered into a senior credit facility the “senior credit facility” with several banks and other financial institutions or entities from time to time parties to the credit agreement 

amounts borrowed under the facility accrued interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin that ranged from 1500 basis points to 3000 basis points or at a base rate as defined in the restated credit agreement plus a margin that ranged from 500 basis points to 2000 basis points in each case based on the consolidated total debt to annualized borrower ebitda ratio as defined in the restated credit agreement a 05 per annum fee was charged on the amount of unused commitment 

on february 11 2010 we terminated our 3200 million senior credit facility we had no borrowings under the senior credit facility at the time of its termination no early termination penalties were incurred by us as a result of the termination 

inflation 

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the continental united states in addition we have towers in canada puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributed 974 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2009 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space primarily to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2009 we owned 8324 tower sites the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers we also manage or lease approximately 5100 actual or potential communications sites approximately 550 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2009 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3–4 per year including the renewal option periods 

in our new build program we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we intend to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants we intend to build at least 120  140 new towers during 2010 

in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower sites portfolio over the past three years 

 

  

  as of december 31 2009 we had an average of 25 tenants per tower 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit our site leasing business generated 859 of our total revenues during the past year and has represented 955 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years 

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions 

  

we provide our site development consulting and construction services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 23 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry overview 

we believe that growing wireless traffic the successful recent spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication sites first consumers continue to increase minutes of use whether through wireline to wireless migration increasing use of broadband services new data products or simply talking more consumers are demanding quality wireless networks and list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service to decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage second we expect that the rollout of 3g and 4g wireless services by existing carriers will require our customers to add a large number of additional cell sites and increase the amount of their equipment at current cell sites the federal communications commission’s the “fcc” successful advanced wireless service spectrum auction 66 for advanced broadband services and the more recent fcc spectrum auction 73 relating to the auction of the 700 mhz band have provided existing carriers the opportunity to deploy spectrum for 3g and 4g wireless service which will further drive the demand for communication sites finally the third area of growth in the us market comes from new market launches for emerging carriers in traditional wireless services or new technologies like wimax for example leap wireless and metro pcs acquired spectrum in auction 66 in new coverage areas that have led and continue to lead to the launch of brand new networks while clearwire is in the process of building out new markets as well despite the current recessionary conditions affecting the global marketplace based on these factors we believe that the us wireless industry will continue to grow and is wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

focusing on our site leasing business with stable recurring revenues we intend to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio  during 2010 we intend to grow our tower portfolio domestically and internationally by 5 to 10 we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be 

  

accretive to our shareholders both short and long term and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios furthermore we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2009 we own or control for a minimum period of fifty years land under 276 of our communication sites 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

  

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

  

   during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their 

  

corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing and sales efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and local office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

competition 

site leasing – our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the national independent tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international and global tower partners 2 a large number of regional independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna space to other providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops outdoor and indoor distributed antenna system “das” networks billboards and electric transmission towers there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past five years specifically american tower completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our acquisition of aat communications corporation in 2006 and crown castle completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle have substantially more towers and greater financial resources than we do wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including bechtel corporation black  veatch corporation goodman networks general dynamics corporation nsoro and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including company experience price track record local reputation geographic reach and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2009 we had 617 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

  

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the fcc and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed altered or used wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require 

  

that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2009 we had 344 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases will contractually provide for approximately 76 million of annual revenue by comparison at december 31 2008 we had 338 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 67 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2009 we had approximately 139 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 174 million as of december 31 2008

 item 1a risk factors 

risks related to our business 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in our customers failing to renew existing leases for tower space or reducing future capital expenditures in the aggregate because their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap or be very similar for example in connection with the combinations of verizon wireless and alltel to form verizon wireless cingular and att wireless to form att mobility and sprint pcs and nextel to form sprint nextel the combined companies have or are considering rationalizing duplicative parts of their networks which has led and may continue to lead to the nonrenewal of certain leases on our towers furthermore to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as much space on our towers in the future if these consolidations significantly impact the number of tower leases that are not renewed or the number of new leases that the wireless service providers require to expand their network our future operating results and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers the loss of any one of our significant customers as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

   

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

  

   revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  

increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio longterm 

we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5 to10 annually through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us if we are not able to successfully address these challenges we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness a large portion of which we will need to refinance in the next two years in the event we are not able to refinance or repay such indebtedness we may not be able to access the cash flow from all of our towers and we may need to take certain actions to service our debt obligations 

as of december 31 2009 we had 28 billion aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding of which 09 billion is scheduled to be repaid in 2011 the amount scheduled to be repaid in 2011 consists solely of the 2006 cmbs certificates which have an anticipated repayment date in november 2011 

we do not currently expect to have sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the full principal amount of the 2006 cmbs certificates consequently we expect to refinance a significant portion of this debt the global credit and capital markets are undergoing a period of substantial volatility and disruption and the global economy is experiencing weakness and uncertainty although the credit markets have improved during 2009 we believe that this volatile credit environment has generally resulted in increased interest rates andor interest rate spread as compared to periods immediately prior to 2007 any renewed financial turmoil worsening credit environment economic weakness and uncertainty could impact our ability and the cost of refinancing our 2006 cmbs certificates 

if we are unable to refinance the 2006 cmbs certificates by november 2011 the cash flow from the 3746 tower sites pledged to secure such mortgage loan underlying the 2006 cmbs certificates representing 45 of our total tower portfolio as of december 31 2009 will be trapped and unavailable to service our other outstanding debt if these cash flows become trapped they would be applied first to repay the interest at the original interest rate on the mortgage loan components underlying the 2006 cmbs certificates second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the pledged towers third to pay the management fees fourth to repay the principal of the 2006 cmbs certificates in the order of their investment grade and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed below as a result of this cash trap we would only have access to the cash flow generated by the remaining approximately 4578 tower sites approximately 55 of our total tower portfolio as of december 31 2009 and the annual management fee equal to 75 of the operating revenues of the borrowers under the cmbs certificates for the immediately preceding calendar month to service our other indebtedness and pay all other corporate expenses furthermore if we are unable to repay the mortgage loan components relating to the 2006 cmbs certificates by november 2011 then the interest rate on the mortgage loan underlying each subclass of the 2006 cmbs certificates would increase by the greater of i 5 or ii the amount if any by which the sum of x the ten year us treasury rate plus y the creditbased spread for the mortgage loan component underlying the referenced subclass of the 2006 cmbs certificates as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement plus z 5 exceeds the original interest rate for such component such additional interest will be payable once the principal of the 2006 cmbs certificates is repaid the sole remedy of the lenders if we do not refinance or repay the 2006 cmbs certificates by november 2011 is the cash trap and the increased interest rates 

  

discussed above but it is not an event of default under the mortgage loan the indenture governing any of our outstanding notes or the senior credit agreement 

if we are unable to refinance the 2006 cmbs certificates and therefore unable to access the cash flow from pledged towers it may have an adverse impact on our ability to i repay our other indebtedness or ii fund our planned capital expenditures which would adversely affect our financial health andor anticipated growth 

recent developments in the global economy could result in a slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space which could adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

due to the recent economic downturn and the resulting unemployment rates in the us and internationally consumer discretionary income has been and may continue to be adversely impacted if wireless service subscribers significantly reduce their minutes of use or fail to widely adopt and use wireless data applications our wireless service provider customers would experience a decrease in demand for their services as a result they may scale back their business plans or otherwise reduce their spending which could materially and adversely affect demand for our tower space and our wireless communications services business which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the recent volatility and disruption of the global credit and capital markets may adversely affect 

 

  

  

 as a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g 4g or other wireless services or worse elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total principal amount of debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2008 and 2009 

 

 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts when due subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our 

  

relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our 2010 credit facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness including our 2006 cmbs certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee that the future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g experienced delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries and deployment of 4g has been limited to date additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may create pricing pressures that may materially and adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive and our customers have numerous alternatives for leasing antenna space some of our competitors such as 1 national wireless carriers that allow collocation on their towers and 2 large independent tower companies are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

 we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business however competitive pricing pressures for tenants on towers from these competitors could materially and adversely affect our lease rates in addition we may not be able to renew existing customer leases or enter into new customer leases resulting in a material adverse impact on our results of operations and growth rate increasing competition could also make the acquisition of high quality tower assets more costly any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment continue to be under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

if we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers it could adversely affect our business and operating results 

our real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and subleasehold interests fee interests easements licenses and rightsofway a loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate a tower and generate revenues for various reasons we may not always have the ability to access analyze and verify all information regarding title and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites which can affect our rights to access and operate a site from time to time we also experience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of ground agreements for land under a tower which can affect our ability to access and operate a tower site further for various reasons landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us they may lose their rights to the land or they may transfer their land interests to third parties including ground lease aggregators which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a future material adverse effect on our business results of operations or financial condition 

  

our foreign operations are subject to economic political and other risks that could materially and adversely affect our revenues or financial position including risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates 

our current business operations in canada and our expansion into any other international markets in the future could result in adverse financial consequences and operational problems not experienced in the united states although the consolidated revenues generated by our international operations were immaterial during the year ended december 31 2009 we anticipate that our revenues from our international operations may grow in the future accordingly our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 in addition we face risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates including those arising from our operations investments and financing transactions related to our international business volatility in foreign currency exchange rates can also affect our ability to plan forecast and budget for our international operations and expansion efforts 

the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan 

the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations since the fall of 2008 the us stock market has been undergoing a period of very high volatility where changes in the market prices of equity securities have often been abrupt and profound over short periods of time the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors including the other factors discussed elsewhere in “risk factors” and in “forwardlooking statements” volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock when they want or at attractive prices consequently volatility of the market price of our class a common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans if we were unable to use equity to fund the growth of our tower portfolio we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth 

  

counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to fulfill their obligations and such failure could subject us to significant costs to replace any such portion of our convertible note hedge transactions or subject us to potential dilution or additional cost if settled in cash upon conversion of our convertible notes 

concurrently with the pricing of our 0375 convertible senior notes due 2010 the “0375 notes” our 1875 convertible senior notes due 2013 the “1875 notes” and our 40 convertible senior notes due 2014 the “40 notes” we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of the convertible note offerings the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 0375 notes is 3356 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 0375 notes and cover 10429720 shares of our class a common stock as of december 31 2009 the convertible note hedge transactions cover 2559185 shares of our class a common stock as a result of repurchases and termination of 2641million in principal of 0375 notes and convertible note hedges the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1875 notes is 4146 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of our 1875 convertible notes and cover 13265780 shares of our class a common stock the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 40 convertible notes is 3038 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 40 notes and cover 16458196 shares of our class a common stock 

since the fall of 2008 global economic conditions and the financial markets have been and continue to be volatile certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy have sold some or all of their assets or may be looking to enter into a merger or other transaction with another financial institution as a result of these conditions some of the counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to perform their obligations under such instruments one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1875 notes was with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” which covers 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion of our 1875 convertible notes in october 2008 lehman derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code which constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives as a result on november 7 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives based on information available to us we have no indication as of the date of filing this form 10k that any party other than lehman derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions 

if we were to elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty we would incur significant costs to replace such hedge transactions additionally if we do not elect to replace our convertible note hedge transactions that were previously with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty fails to perform its obligations under our outstanding convertible note hedge transactions we would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost if settled in cash upon conversion of the applicable 0375 notes 1875 notes and 40 notes 

we may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate  

we currently intend to build at least 120 to 140 new towers during 2010 however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2010 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

  

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

our 2010 credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under the 2010 credit facility in addition if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness including under our 2006 cmbs certificates and our notes then such default could cause a crossdefault under our 2010 credit facility 

the mortgage loan relating to our 2006 cmbs certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage as of the end of any calendar quarter 1 is less than 130 times all cash flow generated by the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and 2 is less than 115 times then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter as lease payments from 3746 tower sites of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan if this cash flow was not available to us it could adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space 

  

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to continue conducting all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us most of our indebtedness is owed directly by our subsidiaries including the mortgage loan underlying the 2006 cmbs notes the 2016 notes the 2019 notes and any amounts that we may borrow under the 2010 credit facility consequently the first use of any cash flow from operations generated by such subsidiaries will be payments of interest and principal if any under their respective indebtedness other than the cash required to repay amounts due under our outstanding convertible notes we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their respective debt obligations the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of their outstanding debt instruments 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

  

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers and auction rate securities in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer thomas p hunt our senior vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel and brendan t cavanagh our senior vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the federal communications commission the “fcc” the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the federal aviation administration “faa” and fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of 

  

towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders we adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other 

  

may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our tax positions or we are unable to utilize our net operating losses 

we are periodically subject to a number of tax examinations by taxing authorities in the states and countries where we do business we also have significant deferred tax assets related to our net operating losses “nols” in us federal and state taxing jurisdictions generally for us federal and state tax purposes nols can be carried forward and used for up to twenty years and all of our tax years will remain subject to examination until three years after our nols are used or expire we expect that we will continue to be subject to tax examinations in the future we recognize tax benefits of uncertain tax positions when we believe the positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon a challenge by the relevant tax authority we believe our judgments in this area are reasonable and correct but there is no guarantee that we will be successful if challenged by a tax authority if there are tax benefits including from our use of nols or other tax attributes that are challenged successfully by a taxing authority we may be required to pay additional taxes or we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which could require significant payments or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

in addition we may be limited in our ability to utilize our nols to offset future taxable income and thereby reduce our otherwise payable income taxes we have substantial federal and state nols including significant portions obtained through acquisitions and dispositions as well as those generated through our historic business operations in addition we have disposed of some entities and restructured other entities in conjunction with financing transactions and other business activities 

to the extent we believe that a position with respect to an nol is not more likely than not to be sustained we do not record the related deferred tax asset in addition for nols that meet the recognition threshold we assess the recoverability of the nol and establish a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to the nol if recoverability is questionable given the uncertainty surrounding the recoverability of certain of our nols we have established a valuation allowance to offset the related deferred tax asset so as to reflect what we believe to be the recoverable portion of our nols 

our ability to utilize our nols is also dependent in part upon us having sufficient future earnings to utilize our nols before they expire if market conditions change materially and we determine that we will be unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future to utilize our nols we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance we review our uncertain tax position and the valuation allowance for our nols periodically and make adjustments from time to time which can result in an increase or decrease to the net deferred tax asset related to our nols our nols are also subject to review and potential disallowance upon audit by the taxing authorities of the jurisdictions where the nols were incurred and future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws could limit materially our ability to utilize our nols if we are unable to use our nols or use of our nols is limited we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce our

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers our principal operations are in the continental united states in addition we have towers in canada puerto rico and the us virgin islands our primary business line is our site leasing business which contributed approximately 974 of our total segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2009 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2009 we owned 8324 tower sites the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers as of december 31 2009 we also managed or leased approximately 5100 actual or potential communications sites approximately 550 of which were revenue producing as of december 31 2009 our other business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3  4 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing lastly ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewal terms of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3  4 annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and total segment operating profit contributed by the site leasing business over the last three years for information regarding our operating segments see note 23 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

  

  

 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction site development services revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or 

  

project management services to wireless service providers we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 

our revenue from site development construction contracts is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue includes all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction contracts are recognized as incurred 

the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues contributed by site development services over the last three years for information regarding our operating segments see note 23 of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the 

  

application of these and other accounting policies see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2009 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

construction revenue 

revenue from construction projects is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or intangible assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

  

key performance indicators 

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including segment operating profit and adjusted ebitda information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures and an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures 

segment operating profit 

we believe that segment operating profit is an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation accretion and amortization which is largely fixed and noncash in nature segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 658 million in 2009 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the revenues from the towers that we acquired in the 2008 acquisitions of optasite light tower and tower co and the other towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2008 organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers in the year ended december 31 2009 control of our site leasing cost of revenue and the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 656 million in 2008 compared to 2007 is primarily related to additional profit generated by the number of towers acquired and constructed for the year ended december 31 2008 as well as additional revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments the reconciliation of segment operating profit is as follows 

 

   

 adjusted ebitda 

we believe that adjusted ebitda is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation that has been used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit facility and senior notes adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap 

adjusted ebitda was 3385 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 2692 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase of 693 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment 

adjusted ebitda was 2692 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2094 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase of 598 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses including amortization of deferred financing fees provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other charges noncash compensation loss gain from extinguishment of debt net other income and expenses acquisition related expenses noncash straightline leasing revenue and noncash straightline ground lease expense adjusted ebitda excludes acquisition related costs which were previously capitalized but commencing january 1 2009 were required to be expensed and included within operating expenses pursuant to the adoption of new business combination accounting guidance the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

  

  

    

results of operations 

year ended 2009 compared to year ended 2008 

 

 revenues 

site leasing revenue increased 815 million for the year ended december 31 2009 largely due to i revenues from the towers that we acquired in the 2008 acquisitions of optasite light tower and tower co and the other towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2008 and ii organic site leasing growth from new leases and contractual rent escalators and lease amendments with current tenants which increased the related rent to reflect additional equipment added to our towers average rents per tenant increased in the year ended december 31 2009 due primarily to rent escalators lease amendments and higher rents associated with new leases 

site development consulting revenue decreased 13 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of a lower volume of work site development construction revenues remained relatively stable for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

  

operating expenses 

site leasing cost of revenues increased 157 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us which was 8324 at december 31 2009 up from 7854 at december 31 2008 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

site development consulting cost of revenues and site development construction cost of revenues decreased by 20 million and 13 million respectively for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the same period in the prior year as a result of lower volume of work and continued effort to manage and reduce fixed overhead costs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 41 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees and increased noncash compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

acquisition related expenses of 48 million are associated with acquisitions which effective january 1 2009 are required to be expensed and included within operating expenses we had historically capitalized the majority of these expenses 

asset impairment of 39 million for the year ended december 31 2009 is a result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for 21 towers that have not achieved expected leaseup results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower assets and an impairment charge on our six das networks based on the estimated fair value of the das networks at december 31 2009 asset impairment of 09 million for the year ended december 31 2008 is a result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for eight towers that have not achieved expected leaseup results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower asset and related intangibles 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 471 million to 2585 million for the year ended december 31 2009 from 2114 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to those owned at december 31 2008 

operating income 

operating income increased 94 million for year ended december 31 2009 to 550 million compared to 456 million for the year ended december 31 2008 primarily due to the result of higher segment operating profit in the site leasing segment partially offset by increases in depreciation accretion and amortization expense acquisition related expenses and selling general and administrative expenses 

other income expense 

interest income decreased 58 million for the year ended december 31 2009 compared to the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates offset by higher average invested funds during 2009 compared to 2008 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 255 million from the year ended december 31 2008 this increase is primarily due to the higher interest rates on the mix of our outstanding debt and the higher weighted average amount of cash interest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to the year ended december 31 2008 

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2009 increased 166 million from the year ended december 31 2008 this increase primarily reflects the accretion of debt discounts on the senior notes which were issued in july 2009 and the 40 notes which were issued in april 2009 and the optasite credit facility 

  

acquired in september 2008 offset by the impact of the repurchase of an aggregate of 3196 million in principal of the 0375 notes in the fourth quarter of 2008 and year ended december 31 2009 

the net loss from extinguishment of debt of 57 million for the year ended december 31 2009 includes a loss of 72 million related to the repurchases and subsequent payoff of our 2005 cmbs certificates in july 2009 27 million associated with the repurchase of 1501 million in principal of our 2006 cmbs certificates and 19 million related to the payoff of our optasite credit facility in july 2009 offset slightly by a gain of 61 million associated with the repurchases of an aggregate of 1077 million in principal of our 0375 notes the net gain from extinguishment of debt of 443 million for the year ended december 31 2008 included 257 million related to the repurchase of 2119 million in principal amount of our 0375 notes and 189 million related to the repurchases of 655 million of our cmbs certificates offset by the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under the senior credit facility as a result of lehman commercial paper inc’s default of its funding obligations see discussion in note 13 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 

other income expense for the year ended december 31 2009 decreased 136 million from the year ended december 31 2008 this decrease primarily reflects an otherthantemporary impairment charge on our investments in auction rate securities during 2008 see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this otherthantemporary impairment charge 

net loss 

net loss was 1411 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 672 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the increase in 2009 is primarily the result of the 2009 net losses from the early extinguishment of debt as opposed to net gains from the early extinguishment of debt in 2008 increases in interest expense noncash interest expense and depreciation accretion and amortization expense partially offset by an increase in site leasing segment operating profit 

  

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

 

 revenues 

site leasing revenue increased 737 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to an increase in the number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from revenue generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2007 additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher annual rents upon renewal by existing tenants and higher rents from additional equipment added by existing tenants 

site development consulting and construction revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 decreased 70 million as a result of a lower volume of work and a wind down of certain of our prior contracts with sprint offset by additional contracts with tmobile and metro pcs 

  

operating expenses 

site leasing cost of revenues increased 82 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of tower sites owned by us which was 7854 at december 31 2008 up from 6220 at december 31 2007 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

site development consulting cost of revenues and site development construction cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased 34 million compared to the same period of 2007 as a result of a decline in the volume of work performed for sprint offset by additional contracts with tmobile and metro pcs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 32 million primarily as a result of a 09 million onetime severance expense related to the departure of our former chief financial officer a 06 million onetime settlement expense associated with the termination of the pension plan we acquired as part of our acquisition of aat communications corporation in 2006 and an increase in salaries benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees and increased noncash compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 

asset impairment of 09 million for the year ended december 31 2008 is the result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for eight towers that have not achieved expected leaseup results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower asset and related intangibles 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 422 million to 2114 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 1692 million for the year ended december 31 2007 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 

operating income 

operating income was 456 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 300 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase is primarily the result of higher site leasing segment operating profit offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation accretion and amortization expense 

other income expense 

interest income decreased 33 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates coupled with a decrease in the average cash balances for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 123 million from the year ended december 31 2007 this increase is primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash interest rate for the same periods specifically we issued 5500 million of 1875 notes in may 2008 borrowed 4656 million and paid fees and interest on borrowings under our senior credit facility which we entered into in january 2008 and assumed as part of the optasite acquisition its 150 million fullydrawn credit facility in september 2008 

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 199 million from the year ended december 31 2007 this increase primarily reflects the accretion of interest for the debt discount on the 1875 notes issued in may 2008 and the discount on the credit facility which was assumed as part of the optasite acquisition in september 2008 

  

amortization of deferred financing fees increased by 26 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was primarily a result of the amortization of fees relating to the senior credit facility entered into during the first quarter of 2008 and the 5500 million principal amount of 1875 notes issued in may 2008 

the net gain from extinguishment of debt was 443 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the net gain includes the extinguishment of 1381 million in principal amount of our 0375 notes and 655 million of our cmbs certificates for 1478 million in cash and the issuance of 3407914 shares of our class a common stock for 738 million in principal amount of 0375 notes offset by the writeoff of deferred financing fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under the senior credit facility as a result of lehman commercial paper inc’s default of its funding obligations see discussion in note 13 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information the loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in april 2007 

other expense of 135 million and 158 million for the years ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively includes an otherthantemporary impairment loss on investments associated with our investments in auction rate securities see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this otherthantemporary impairment charge 

net loss 

net loss was 672 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 915 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease of 243 million is primarily the result of the net gains from the early extinguishment of debt and an increase in site leasing segment operating profit partially offset by an increase in depreciation accretion and amortization expense interest expense amortization of deferred financing fees and other expense 

liquidity and capital resources 

sba communications corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own sba communications’ only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications inc which is also a holding company that owns equity interests in 1 sba infrastructure holdings i inc the entity that indirectly owns all of the towers and other assets acquired in the optasite acquisition 2 sba senior finance inc the entity that indirectly owns all of our other domestic towers and assets and 3 our international entities we conduct all of our business operations through telecommunications’ subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries 

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

 

   

sources of liquidity 

we fund our growth including our tower portfolio growth through cash flows from operations longterm indebtedness and equity issuances with respect to our debt financing we have utilized secured and unsecured financings and issuances at various levels of our organizational structure to minimize our financing costs while maximizing our operational flexibility 

cash provided by operating activities was 2196 million for the year ended december 31 2009 as compared to 1737 million for the year ended december 31 2008 this increase was primarily the result of an increase in segment operating profit from the site leasing segment 

on july 24 2009 telecommunications issued 750 million of unsecured senior notes which we refer to as the senior notes 375 million of which are due 2016 the “2016 notes” and 375 million of which are due 2019 the “2019 notes” the 2016 notes have an interest rate of 800 and were issued at a price of 99330 of their face value the 2019 notes have an interest rate of 825 and were issued at a price of 99152 of their face value net proceeds of this offering were 7279 million after deducting expenses and original issue discount telecommunications used the net proceeds to repay the 2005 cmbs certificates issued by its subsidiary and the related prepayment consideration and repay the principal amounts outstanding under the optasite credit facility and the senior credit facility telecommunications also intends to use the net proceeds from this offering to repurchase prior to maturity or repay at maturity our outstanding 0375 notes the remaining net proceeds are being used for general corporate purposes

uses of liquidity 

traditionally our principal use of liquidity has been cash capital expenditures associated with the growth of our tower portfolio during the recent market disruptions that occurred from october 2008 through 2009 we utilized our liquidity to take advantage of certain market opportunities and repurchase our outstanding debt however based on the normalization of the capital markets and our recent financing activity we currently believe that our principal use of liquidity will be to fund tower growth and secondarily our stock repurchase program however in the future we may continue to repurchase for cash or equity our outstanding indebtedness in privatelynegotiated or open market transactions in order to optimize our liquidity and leverage and take advantage of market opportunities 

our cash capital expenditures including cash used for acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2009 were 2275 million the 2275 million includes cash capital expenditures of 1692 million that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of 376 completed towers net of related working capital adjustments and net of related prorated rental receipts and payments and earnouts associated with previous acquisitions the 2275 million also includes 302 million related to new tower construction 66 million for maintenance tower capital expenditures 83 million for augmentations and tower upgrades 16 million for general corporate expenditures and 116 million for ground lease purchases the 302 million of new tower construction includes costs associated with the completion of 101 new towers for the year ended december 31 2009 and costs incurred on sites currently in process in addition we paid 42 million in cash to amend and extend existing ground leases 

subsequent to december 31 2009 we acquired 14 towers from third party sellers and an equity interest in das provider extenet systems inc in exchange for 429 million in cash and a contribution of our six das networks 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased in privately negotiated or open market transactions an aggregate of 1077 million of our 0375 notes and 1501 million in principal of our 2006 cmbs certificates for aggregate consideration of 618000 shares of our class a common stock and 2411 million in cash in addition in july 2009 we used the proceeds from the issuance of our senior notes to repay the remaining outstanding balances of our 2005 cmbs certificates and our senior credit facility and repay and terminate the optasite credit facility 

  

subsequent to december 31 2009 we repurchased an aggregate of 20 million of our 2006 cmbs certificates for 21 million in cash 

the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective november 3 2009 this program authorizes us to purchase from time to time up to 2500 million of our outstanding class a common stock through open market repurchases in compliance with rule 10b18 of the securities act of 1933 as amended andor in privately negotiated transactions at management’s discretion based on market and business conditions applicable legal requirements and other factors this program will continue until otherwise modified or terminated by our board of directors at any time in our sole discretion in connection with the stock repurchase program in december 2009 we repurchased and retired approximately 52000 shares for an aggregate of 17 million including commissions and fees 

subsequent to december 31 2009 we have repurchased 207000 shares for an aggregate of 67 million including commissions and fees 

in order to manage our leverage position andor to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions these transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness the repurchase of outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity selling certain assets or lines of business issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or pursuing other financing alternatives including securitization transactions if either our debt repurchases or exchanges or any of the other financial transactions are implemented these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding increase our interest expense andor dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that we will not implement any of these strategies or that if implemented these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 

during 2010 we expect to incur nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of 7 million to 11 million and discretionary cash capital expenditures based on current obligations of 120 million to 140 million primarily associated with the towers we intend to build in 2010 tower acquisitions currently under contract tower augmentations and ground lease purchases we intend to spend additional capital in 2010 on acquiring revenue producing assets not yet identified and under contract 

we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers all of these planned cash capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under the 2010 credit facility the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and tower acquisition program and our ground lease purchase program 

debt instruments and debt service requirements 

as of december 31 2009 we believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations for the next twelve months will be sufficient to service our outstanding debt during the next twelve months 

cmbs certificates 

in november 2005 an indirect subsidiary of sba senior finance the “trust” issued 405 million of cmbs certificates the “2005 cmbs certificates” in november 2006 the trust subsequently issued 115 billion of cmbs certificates the “2006 cmbs certificates” and collectively with the 2005 cmbs certificates the “cmbs certificates” 

the 2005 cmbs certificates consisted of five classes with annual passthrough interest rates ranging from 5369 to 6706 the 2005 cmbs certificates had an anticipated repayment date of november 2010 with a final repayment date in 2035 during 2009 we repurchased in privately negotiated and open market transactions 

  

an aggregate of 186 million in principal amount of the 2005 cmbs certificates for cash consideration of 166 million on july 28 2009 we repaid the remaining outstanding balance of the 2005 cmbs certificates for 3903 million in cash including 101 million in prepayment consideration in addition during 2008 we repurchased in privately negotiated and open market transactions an aggregate of 62 million in principal amount of the 2005 cmbs certificates for cash consideration of 55 million 

the 2006 cmbs certificates consist of nine classes with annual passthrough interest rates ranging from 5314 to 7825 the weighted average annual fixed interest rate of the 2006 cmbs certificates as of december 31 2009 is 59 payable monthly and the effective weighted average annual fixed interest rate is 62 after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered into in contemplation of the transaction the 2006 cmbs certificates have an anticipated repayment date of november 2011 with a final repayment date in 2036 however to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the 2006 cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by their anticipated repayment dates the interest rate of each component would increase by the greater of i 5 or ii the amount if any by which the sum of x the tenyear us treasury rate plus y the creditbased spread for such component as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement plus z 5 exceeds the original interest rate for such component 

during the year ended december 31 2009 we repurchased an aggregate of 1501 million in principal amount of 2006 cmbs certificates for 1505 million in cash at december 31 2009 we had 9406 million outstanding of 2006 cmbs certificates based on the amounts outstanding at december 31 2009 debt service for the next twelve months on the 2006 cmbs certificates will be approximately 555 million 

subsequent to december 31 2009 we repurchased an aggregate of 20 million in principal amount of 2006 cmbs certificates for 21 million in cash our outstanding balance on the 2006 cmbs certificates was 9386 million as of the date of this filing 

the cmbs certificates are repayable with the proceeds of a nonrecourse mortgage loan the sole asset of the trust made in favor of certain operating subsidiaries of sba senior finance the “cmbs borrowers” the cmbs borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers that are subject to the securitization the “cmbs towers” each of the cmbs borrowers who are jointly and severally liable under the mortgage loan have pledged the cash flows from the cmbs towers owned by the entity as security under the mortgage loan as of december 31 2009 the cmbs borrowers owned an aggregate 3746 tower sites 

if the cmbs borrowers are in compliance with the required debt service coverage ratio set forth in the mortgage loan underlying the 2006 cmbs certificates and the anticipated repayment date has not yet occurred then the cash flow generated by the cmbs towers after 1 payment of the interest on the mortgage loan 2 funding of all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the cmbs towers and 3 payment of the management fees due to sba network management inc equal to 75 of the cmbs borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month will be distributed to the cmbs borrowers 

however if the debt service coverage ratio “net cash flow” as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the sum of the interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that the cmbs borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months falls to 130x or lower as of the end of any calendar quarter then all operating cash flow from the cmbs towers in excess of amounts required to i pay interest at the original interest rate on the mortgage loan underlying the 2006 cmbs certificates ii fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the pledged towers and iii pay the sba network management fees will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the cmbs borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the cmbs borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130x for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115x as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account and all excess cash flow generated thereafter will be applied to prepay the components of the mortgage loan in the order of their investment grade until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115x for a calendar quarter in addition if the 2006 cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by their repayment date the cash 

  

flow from the cmbs towers will be trapped by the trustee for the 2006 cmbs certificates and applied first to repay the interest on the mortgage loan calculated at the original interest rate second to fund all reserve accounts and operating expenses associated with the cmbs towers third to pay the sba network management fees fourth to repay principal of the 2006 cmbs certificates in the order of their investment grade and fifth to repay the additional interest discussed above as of december 31 2009 we were in compliance with the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan agreement 

at any time prior to november 2011 the cmbs borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the 2006 cmbs certificates upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration the prepayment consideration is determined per class and consists of an amount equal to the excess if any of 1 the present value on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date assuming the entire unpaid principal amount of such class is required to be paid over 2 that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment if the prepayment occurs i within nine months of the anticipated repayment date ii with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of the cmbs borrowers’ sites or iii during an amortization period no prepayment consideration is due the entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan components corresponding to the 2006 cmbs certificates will be due in november 2036 the mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date 

the mortgage loan is secured by 1 mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the tower sites and their operating cash flows 2 a security interest in substantially all of the cmbs borrowers’ personal property and fixtures 3 the cmbs borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they entered into with sba network management inc “sba network management” relating to the management of the cmbs borrowers’ tower sites by sba network management pursuant to which sba network management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the cmbs borrowers’ behalf 4 the cmbs borrowers’ right under certain site management agreements 5 the cmbs borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases 6 the pledge by sba cmbs1 guarantor llc and sba cmbs1 holdings llc of equity interest of the initial borrower and sba cmbs1 guarantor llc 7 the various deposit accounts and collection accounts of the cmbs borrowers and 8 all proceeds of the foregoing

2016 senior notes and the 2019 senior notes will be approximately 300 million and 309 million respectively 

inflation 

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributed 976 of our segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2008 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2008 we owned 7854 towers the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to wireless service providers we also manage or lease approximately 4200 actual or potential communications sites of which approximately 600 are revenue producing our second business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3– 4 per year including the renewal option periods 

as of december 31 2008 we owned 7854 towers up from 6220 as of december 31 2007 due to the recent instability in the credit markets and the challenging macroeconomic environment in the us we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio modestly in 2009 we intend to obtain this modest growth primarily through new tower builds pursuant to our historical growth initiatives we built 85 towers and acquired 1560 towers during 2008 compared to the year ended 2007 where we built 61 towers and acquired 612 towers 

in addition in late 2008 as part of our acquisition of light tower wireless llc “light tower” we acquired five distributed antenna system “das” networks the das networks constitute our first experience offering this type of wireless service das is a low visibility network that uses hub and spoke architecture to connect base station equipment to a low power fiberopticfed network das is a complement to traditional tower leasing in areas with challenging zoning regulations or physical obstructions that significantly degrade or restrict coverage das networks can be deployed by attaching the discrete radiofrequency equipment to existing structures such as utility poles and street lights 

in our new build program we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customer’s network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we intend to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants we intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2009 

in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of 

  

a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix due to the current economic environment we currently intend to limit our acquisition strategy to acquisitions for stock consideration that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and longterm and which meet our investment returns and criteria we intend to resume acquisitions for cash at such time as we see sufficient improvement in the credit markets 

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past three years 

 

    as of december 31 2008 we had 19344 tenants on the 7854 tower sites we owned as of that date or an average of 25 tenants per tower 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit as indicated in the tables below our site leasing business generated 833 of our total revenues during the past year and has represented 95 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years 

 

  

     

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions 

we provide our site development consulting and construction services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry overview 

we believe that growing wireless traffic the successful recent spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use first consumers continue to increase minutes of use whether through wireline to wireless migration increasing use of broadband services new data products or simply talking more consumers are demanding quality wireless networks and list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service to decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage second we expect that the rollout of 3g and 4g wireless services by existing carriers will require our customers to add a large number of additional cell sites and increase the amount of their equipment at current cell sites the federal communications commission’s the “fcc” successful advanced wireless service spectrum auction 66 for advanced broadband services and the more recent fcc spectrum auction 73 relating to the auction of the 700 mhz band have provided existing carriers the opportunity to deploy spectrum for 3g and 4g wireless service which will further drive the demand for communication sites finally the third area of growth in the us market comes from new market launches for emerging carriers in traditional wireless services or new technologies like wimax for example leap wireless and metro pcs acquired spectrum in auction 66 in new coverage areas that have led and continue to lead to the launch of brand new networks while clearwire is in the process of building out new markets as well despite the current recessionary conditions affecting the global marketplace based on these factors we believe that the us wireless industry will continue to grow and is wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

  

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

focusing on our site leasing business with stable recurring revenues we intend to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of our tower portfolio  during 2009 we intend to modestly grow our tower portfolio principally through new builds we have historically used our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build and acquire new towers at prices which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios however given the recent instability in the credit markets we have begun to focus some of our available cash resources on reducing our leverage levels in addition we may pursue some tower acquisitions for stock in situations that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and longterm and which meet our investment returns and criteria we intend to resume acquisitions for cash at such time as we see sufficient improvement in the credit markets we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2008 we own or control for a minimum period of fifty years land under 26 of our communication sites 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

  

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

 during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

  

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing and sales efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and local office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

competition 

site leasing – our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the large independent tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international and global tower partners 2 a large number of smaller independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops broadcast towers and utility poles there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past four years specifically american tower completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our acquisition of aat communications corporation in 2006 and crown castle completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle have substantially more towers and greater financial resources than we do wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

site development – the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including bechtel corporation black  veatch corporation goodman networks general dynamics corporation nsoro and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation geographic reach price and time for completion of a project 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2008 we had 627 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed altered or used 

  

wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc regulations antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operation of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

our das network provides service providers with facilities to offer various wireless communications services we therefore offer facilities supporting other communications services providing service within a state as a competitive local exchange carrier “clec” clec status enables us to negotiate access to utility poles and conduits on fair reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms consistent with the communications act and applicable state law in a number of states we must obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity or similar authority to provide clec service additionally as a clec federal regulation requires us to comply with regulatory and filing requirements of a ministerial nature 

  

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2008 we had 338 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 83 million of annual revenue by comparison at december 31 2007 we had 265 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 59 million of annual revenue

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks related to our business 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness a large portion of which we will need to refinance in the next three years in the event we are not able to refinance or repay such indebtedness we may not be able to access the cash flow from all of our towers and we may need to take certain actions to service our debt obligations 

we have a substantial amount of indebtedness approximately 255 billion as of december 31 2008 and we anticipate refinancing a significant amount of this indebtedness within the next three years as of february 24 2009 we had 20 billion of indebtedness outstanding that has an initial or anticipated maturity date within the next three years including 3918 million of our 2005 commercial mortgagebacked passthrough certificates which have an anticipated repayment date of november 2010 11 billion of our 2006 commercial mortgagebacked passthrough certificates which have an anticipated repayment date of november 2011 1042 million of 0375 convertible senior notes due november 2010 2306 million of borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and 1490 million under our credit facility assumed in the optasite acquisition the “optasite credit facility” each facility matures in 2010 

if our cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by their anticipated repayment dates november 2010 for the 2005 cmbs certificates and november 2011 for the 2006 cmbs certificates then the interest rates on each of the cmbs certificates on such date will increase by the greater of i 5 or ii the amount if any by which the sum of x the tenyear us treasury rate plus y the creditbased spread for such component as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement plus z 5 exceeds the original interest rate for such component such additional interest will accrue and be payable once the principal of all cmbs certificates are repaid furthermore if our 2005 cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by november 2010 then substantially all of the cash flows from the 4969 towers owned by the borrowers under the cmbs certificates will be trapped by the trustee and applied first to repay the original cash coupons on the cmbs certificates then to fund reserves and administrative costs and then to repay principal of the 2005 and the 2006 cmbs certificates in the order of their investment grade ie the 20051a and 20061a subclasses would have their respective principal repaid equally prior to repayment of the other subclasses of the cmbs certificates if we are unable to repay our 2005 cmbs certificates on november 2010 then we would only have access to the cash flow generated by the remaining approximately 2900 towers to repay our other indebtedness and pay all our other corporate expenses 

during 2007 a crisis began in the subprime mortgage sector of the us economy as a result of credit quality deterioration and rising delinquencies and that crisis has continued and strengthened throughout 2008 and into 2009 which has led to continued deterioration of the credit markets a closing up of the debt markets and widening credit spreads also stemming from this crisis the us economy is undergoing a period of recession slowdown and high volatility this crisis has adversely impacted our access to capital and there can be no assurance that this crisis will not worsen or impact the availability or cost of debt financing in the future there can be no assurance that we will be able to effect the anticipated refinancing described above on terms as favorable as our current debt on commercially acceptable terms or at all 

if we are unable to refinance our debt we cannot guarantee that we will generate enough cash flow from operations or that we will be able to obtain enough capital to service our debt obligations and fund our planned capital expenditures in such event we might need to sell certain assets or lines of business issue common stock or securities convertible into common stock to fulfill our debt obligations if implemented these actions could negatively impact our business or dilute our existing shareholders 

  

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which may have an adverse effect on our business or limit our ability to take advantage of business strategic or financing opportunities 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2007 and 2008 

 

 our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts when due subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our substantial level of indebtedness and the uncertainties arising in the credit markets and the us economy 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our senior secured revolving credit facility and our optasite credit facility assumed in the optasite acquisition and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness including our cmbs certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

  

any slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

demand for antenna space on our towers and for our site development services depends on demand for wireless services from 2001 through 2003 economic downturns in the us economy including the wireless telecommunications industry negatively influenced demand for tower space and site development services the current economic downturn in the us economy and similar slowdowns in the future may adversely affect 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g 4g or other wireless services or worse elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for our towers 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

demand for our services may decline if there is additional significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate or fail to renew existing leases for tower space because many of their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers specifically cingular acquired att wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005 as a result of the cingularatt wireless merger as of december 31 2008 att had terminated 307 tenant leases with us which had 77 million of annualized rental revenue on towers where both cingular and att wireless had previously had antennas in addition att did not renew certain tenant leases for other communication sites in close proximity to the extent that it believed it did not need the additional capacity although we have not currently experienced any significant amount of churn as a result of the sprintnextel merger due primarily to the different technologies utilized and their decision to operate two networks we may in the future experience terminations andor nonrenewals due to this merger furthermore to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as much space on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries the announcement of 4g is relatively new and its deployment has been limited to date additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers the loss of any one of our significant customers as a result of bankruptcy merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers representing at least 10 of revenue in any of the last three years and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

   

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

 revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive competitive pressures for tenants could adversely affect our lease rates in addition the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues margins and financial condition 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

   

  

 there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years specifically american tower corporation completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our acquisition of aat communication corporation in 2006 and crown castle international completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and may have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment continue to be under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan 

the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations since the fall of 2008 the us stock market has been undergoing a period of very high volatility where changes in the market prices of equity securities have often been abrupt and profound over short periods of time the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors including the other factors discussed elsewhere in “risk factors” and in “forwardlooking statements” volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock when they want or at attractive prices consequently volatility of the market price of our class a common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans if we were unable to use equity to fund growth of our tower portfolio we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth 

counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to fulfill their obligations and such failure could subject us to significant costs to replace any such portion of our convertible note hedge transactions or subject us to potential dilution or additional cost if settled in cash upon conversion of our convertible notes 

concurrently with the pricing of our 0375 notes and our 1875 notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions with affiliates of certain of the initial purchasers of both convertible note offerings the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 0375 notes is 3356 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of the 0375 notes and cover 10429720 shares of our class a common stock the initial strike price of the convertible note hedge transactions relating to our 1875 notes is 4146 per share of our class a common stock the same as the initial conversion price of our 1875 convertible notes and cover 13265780 shares of our class a common stock 

  

since the fall of 2008 global economic conditions and the financial markets have been and continue to be volatile certain financial institutions have filed for bankruptcy have sold some or all of their assets or may be looking to enter into a merger or other transaction with another financial institution as a result of these conditions some of the counterparties to our convertible note hedge transactions may be unable to perform their obligations under such instruments one of the convertible note hedge transactions entered into in connection with our 1875 notes was with lehman brothers otc derivatives inc “lehman derivatives” which covers 55 of the 13265780 shares of our class a common stock potentially issuable upon conversion in october 2008 lehman derivatives filed a voluntary petition for protection under chapter 11 of the united states bankruptcy code which constituted an “event of default” under the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives as a result on november 7 2008 we terminated the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives based on information available to us we have no indication as of the date of filing this form 10k that any party other than lehman derivatives would be unable to fulfill their obligations to us under the convertible note hedge transactions 

if we were to elect to replace the convertible note hedge transaction with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty we would incur significant costs to replace such hedge transactions additionally if we do not elect to replace our convertible note hedge transactions that were previously with lehman derivatives or any other counterparty fails to perform its obligations under our outstanding convertible note hedge transactions we would be subject to potential dilution or additional cost if settled in cash upon conversion of the applicable 0375 notes and 1875 notes 

increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio longterm 

although our current plans only contemplate modest growth of our tower portfolio in 2009 primarily through new tower builds our ability to achieve material longterm tower portfolio growth will depend on our ability to acquire towers from third parties traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us if we are not able to successfully resolve these issues we may not be able to materially increase our tower portfolio in the longterm 

we may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate 

we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2009 however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2009 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

our senior secured revolving credit facility and the optasite credit facility contain certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit our ability to 

 

   

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under the senior secured revolving credit facility in addition if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness including under our cmbs certificates and our notes then such default could cause a crossdefault under our senior secured revolving credit facility 

the mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage as of the end of any calendar quarter 1 is less than 130 times all cash flow generated by the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and 2 is less than 115 times then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter as lease payments from 4969 towers of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan if this cash flow was not available to us it would adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us additionally the borrowers on the mortgage loan supporting the cmbs certificates must repay the components of the mortgage loan if such 

  

borrowers’ cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4969 tower sites that secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan other than the cash required to repay amounts due under the cmbs certificates we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to repay our notes the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs certificates other than those entities obligated under the cmbs certificates or make any funds available to us for payment the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility and the cmbs certificates 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt as well as impairment charges on our towers and auction rate securities in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer and thomas p hunt our senior vice president chief administrative officer and general counsel we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to exposure to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the federal communications commission the “fcc” the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to exposure to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the federal aviation administration “faa” and fcc regulate the construction modification and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to 

  

obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders we adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

  

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities would have on the market price of our class a common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributes approximately 98 of our total segment operating profit in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2008 we owned 7854 towers we also manage or lease approximately 4200 actual or potential communications sites of which approximately 600 are revenue producing our second business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site each tenant lease is generally for an initial term of five years with five 5year renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3—4 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include 

  

replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing lastly ground leases are generally for an initial term of five years or more with multiple renewable options of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3  4 annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and total segment operating profit contributed by the site leasing business 

 

  

 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development business is complimentary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition technical services and construction 

site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of this project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 

our revenue from site development construction contracts is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty 

  

inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue includes all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction contracts are recognized as incurred 

the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues contributed by site development services over the last three years information regarding the total assets used in our site development services business is included in note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2008 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

construction revenue 

revenue from construction projects is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

  

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or intangible assets has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

results of operations 

year ended 2008 compared to year ended 2007 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased 737 million for the year ended december 31 2008 due to an increase in the number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from revenue generated by the towers that we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2007 as of december 31 2008 we had 19344 tenants as compared to 15429 tenants at december 31 2007 additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher annual rents upon renewal by existing tenants and higher rents from additional equipment added by existing tenants 

site development consulting and construction revenue for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 decreased 70 million as a result of a lower volume of work and a wind down of certain of our prior contracts with sprint offset by additional contracts with tmobile and metro pcs 

  

operating expenses 

 

 site leasing cost of revenues increased 82 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of towers owned by us which was 7854 at december 31 2008 up from 6220 at december 31 2007 offset by the positive impact of our ground lease purchase program 

site development cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2008 decreased 34 million compared to the same period of 2007 as a result of a decline in the volume of work performed for sprint offset by additional contracts with tmobile and metro pcs 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 33 million primarily as a result of a 09 million onetime severance expense related to the departure of our former chief financial officer a 06 million onetime settlement expense associated with the termination of the pension plan the company acquired as part of its acquisition of aat communications corporation in 2006 and an increase in salaries benefits and other employee related expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees and increased noncash compensation expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 

asset impairment of 09 million for the year ended december 31 2008 is the result of a reevaluation of future cash flow expectations for eight towers that have not achieved expected lease up results as determined using a discounted cash flow analysis compared to the related net book value of the tower asset and related intangibles 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 422 million to 2114 million for the year ended december 31 2008 from 1692 million for the year ended december 31 2007 due to an increase in the number of towers and associated intangible assets we owned for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 

operating income 

operating income was 456 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 300 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase of 156 million is primarily the result of higher site leasing segment operating profit offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation accretion and amortization expense 

  

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 656 million is primarily related to additional revenue generated by the number of towers acquired and constructed for the year ended december 31 2008 as well as additional revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue we reconcile these nongaap financial measures and provide the regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section titled nongaap financial measures 

other income expense 

 

 interest income decreased 33 million for the year ended december 31 2008 when compared to the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease is primarily the result of lower interest rates coupled with a decrease in the average cash balances for the year ended december 31 2008 compared to the same period of 2007 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2008 increased 118 million from the year ended december 31 2007 this increase is primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash interest rate for the same periods specifically we issued 5500 million of 1875 convertible senior notes in may 2008 borrowed 4656 million and paid fees and interest on borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility which we entered into in january 2008 and assumed as part of the optasite acquisition its 150 million fullydrawn credit facility in september 2008 

noncash interest for the year ended december 31 2008 is due to the accretion of interest for the discount on the credit facility which was assumed as part of the optasite acquisition in september 2008 there was no noncash interest for the year ended december 31 2007 

amortization of deferred financing fees increased by 31 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to the year ended december 31 2007 this increase was primarily a result of the amortization of fees relating to the senior secured revolving credit facility entered into during the first quarter of 2008 and the 5500 million principal amount of 1875 convertible senior notes issued in may 2008 

  

the net gain from extinguishment of debt and writeoff of deferred financing fees was 316 million for the year ended december 31 2008 the net gain includes 556 million associated with the extinguishment of 1381 million in principal amount of our 0375 convertible senior notes and 655 million of our cmbs certificates for 1478 million in cash the net gain was offset by a loss of 195 million related to the exchange of 3407914 shares of our class a common stock for 738 million in principal amount of 0375 notes and the writeoff of 45 million of deferred financing fees related to the portion of the debt extinguished and the reduction in the aggregate commitment of the lenders under the senior secured revolving credit facility as a result of lehman commercial paper inc’s default of its funding obligations see discussion in note 12 to the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information the loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in april 2007 

other expense of 135 million and 158 million includes an otherthantemporary impairment loss on investments for the year ended december 31 2008 and december 31 2007 respectively associated with our investments in auction rate securities see discussion in “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this otherthantemporary impairment charge 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 2692 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 2094 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the increase of 598 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment we reconcile this measure and other regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled nongaap financial measures 

net loss 

net loss was 468 million for the year ended december 31 2008 as compared to 779 million for the year ended december 31 2007 the decrease of 311 million is primarily the result of the net gains from the early extinguishment of debt and an increase in site leasing segment operating profit partially offset by an increase in depreciation accretion and amortization expense interest expense amortization of deferred financing fees and other expense 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased 656 million due to an increase in the number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from revenue generated by the towers that we acquired in our april 2006 acquisition of aat communications corporation “aat” and the other towers we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2005 the 1850 aat towers were only owned for eight months for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the entire year ended december 31 2007 the aat towers contributed 

  

approximately 986 million of the total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 compared to approximately 632 million for the same period of 2006 an increase of approximately 354 million as of december 31 2007 we had 15429 tenants as compared to 13602 tenants at december 31 2006 additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher annual rents upon renewal by existing tenants and increased rental rates associated with additional equipment added by existing tenants 

site development consulting revenue increased 77 million as a result of a higher volume of work for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the same period of 2006 the higher volume of work was primarily due to services provided in connection with sprint’s development of its network 

site development construction revenue decreased 162 million due to the wind down or completion of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless service providers as well as a significant decline in the volume of work performed for att during 2007 as compared to the same period in the prior year 

operating expenses 

 

 site leasing cost of revenues increased 173 million primarily as a result of the aat towers and the growth in the number of towers owned by us which was 6220 at december 31 2007 up from 5551 at december 31 2006 the aat towers contributed approximately 278 million to the total site leasing cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to approximately 196 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of approximately 82 million 

site development consulting cost of revenues increased 52 million as a result of higher volume of work for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the same period of 2006 largely due to services provided during 2007 in connection with sprint’s development of its network site development construction cost of revenue decreased 158 million due to the wind down or completion of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless service providers as well as a significant decline in the volume of work performed for att for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 33 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries benefits and other back office expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees a significant portion of which is attributable to the aat acquisition selling general and administrative expenses were also impacted by 63 million of stock option and employee stock purchase plan expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2007 in accordance with sfas 123r as compared to 53 million in the comparable period in 2006 an increase of 10 million 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 361 million to 1692 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 1331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 712 million was associated with the aat towers for the year ended december 31 2007 versus approximately 464 million for the comparable period in 2006 an increase of approximately 248 million 

  

operating income 

operating income was 300 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 195 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase of 105 million is primarily the result of higher revenues without a commensurate increase in cost of revenues in the site leasing and site development consulting segments offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation accretion and amortization expense 

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 483 million is primarily related to additional revenue generated by the increased number of towers acquired in the aat acquisition the aat towers contributed approximately 708 million of the total site leasing segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to approximately 436 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of approximately 272 million the remaining increase in our site leasing segment operating profit is due to increased revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the same period in 2006 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue we reconcile these nongaap financial measures and provide the regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section titled nongaap financial measures 

other income expense 

 

 interest income increased 64 million for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase is primarily the result of investment earnings on the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes the “notes” offering completed at the end of the first quarter of 2007 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 112 million from the year ended december 31 2006 this increase is primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash interest rate for the same periods specifically 1 our 11 billion bridge loan for the aat acquisition was only outstanding for seven months of the year ended december 31 2006 and was not outstanding during any portion of the year ended december 31 2007 while the 

  

11 billion cmbs certificates issued in 2006 which were used to refinance the bridge loan were outstanding for a little over one month for the year ended december 31 2006 and were outstanding for the full year ended december 31 2007 and 2 we had 3500 million of additional debt outstanding for nine months in 2007 consisting of our 0375 notes compared to none in the year ended december 31 2006 

there was no noncash interest for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease was a result of the repurchase of all of the outstanding 9 3  4  senior discount notes in april 2006 

amortization of deferred financing fees decreased by 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this decrease was primarily a result of fully amortizing fees relating to the 16 billion of cmbs certificates over a period of five years with one year of amortization during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to fully amortizing fees on the 11 billion bridge loan over nine months with seven months of amortization during the year ended december 31 2006 

the loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in april 2007 this amount was 572 million for the year ended december 31 2006 associated with the loss from writeoff of 102 million of deferred financing fees and 470 million of losses on extinguishment of debt resulting from the prepayment of the 11 billion bridge loan in november 2006 and the repurchase of the 8 1  2  senior notes and 9 3  4  senior discount notes in april 2006 

other expense of 158 million includes an otherthantemporary impairment loss on shortterm investments of 156 million for the year ended december 31 2007 associated with our investments in auction rate securities see discussion in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this otherthantemporary impairment charge 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 2094 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1618 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase of 476 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment largely driven from the aat acquisition we reconcile this measure and other regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled nongaap financial measures 

net loss 

net loss was 779 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1334 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease of 555 million is primarily the result of the decrease in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt

from time to time in order to optimize our liquidity and leverage and take advantage of certain market opportunities we have and may in the future repurchase for cash or equity our outstanding indebtedness including our 0375 convertible notes due 2010 our 1875 convertible senior notes due 2013 and our 2005 and 2006 collateralized mortgage backed securities in privatelynegotiated transactions or in open market transactions 

in order to manage our leverage position andor to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may decide to pursue a variety of other financial transactions these transactions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness the repurchase of outstanding indebtedness for cash or equity selling certain assets or lines of business issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or pursuing other financing alternatives including securitization transactions if either our debt repurchases or exchanges or any of the other financial transactions are implemented these actions could materially impact the amount and composition of indebtedness outstanding increase our interest expense andor dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that we will not implement any of these strategies or that if implemented these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders 

based on the current state of the credit markets during 2009 we expect to limit our cash capital expenditures to 1 nondiscretionary cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures which we expect to be in the range of 60 million to 90 million in 2009 and 2 discretionary cash capital expenditures primarily associated with the 80 to 100 towers we intend to build in 2009 tower augmentations and ground lease purchases which we expect to be in the range of 300 million to 500 million in 2009 if we refinance some of our debt in 2009 we may increase our cash capital expenditures in the interim we may pursue limited tower acquisitions for stock when we can do so on an immediately accretive basis and the acquisition otherwise meets our investment returns and criteria 

we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers all of these planned cash capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and tower acquisition program and our ground lease purchase program

the assets of the trust which issued both the initial cmbs certificates and the additional cmbs certificates consist of a nonrecourse mortgage loan initially made in favor of sba properties as the initial borrower in connection with the additional cmbs certificates each of sba sites inc sba structures inc sba towers inc sba puerto rico inc and sba towers usvi inc the “additional borrowers” and collectively with sba properties inc the “borrowers” were added as additional borrowers under the mortgage loan and the principal amount of the mortgage loan was increased by 115 billion to an aggregate of 156 billion the mortgage loan consists of multiple tranches or components each of which has terms that are identical to the subclass of cmbs certificates to which it relates the borrowers are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers which are subject to the securitization 

the mortgage loan is to be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 4969 towers owned by the borrowers the “cmbs towers” subject to certain limited exceptions described below no payments of principal will be required to be made for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates prior to the monthly payment date in november 2010 which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates and no payments of principal will be required to be made for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates prior to the monthly payment date in november 2011 which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates 

the borrowers may prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part at any time prior to november 2010 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates and november 2011 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates upon payment of the applicable prepayment consideration the prepayment consideration is determined per class and consists of an amount equal to the excess if any of 1 the present value on the date of prepayment of all future installments of principal and interest required to be paid from the date of prepayment to and including the first due date that is nine months prior to the anticipated repayment date assuming the entire unpaid principal amount of such class is required to be paid over 2 that portion of the principal balance of such class prepaid on the date of such prepayment if the prepayment occurs i within nine months of the anticipated repayment date ii with proceeds received as a result of any condemnation or casualty of the borrowers’ sites or iii during an amortization period no prepayment consideration is due the entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan components corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates will be due in november 2035 and those corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates will be due in november 2036 however to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates or the amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates the interest rate of each component would increase by the greater of i 5 or ii the amount if any by which the sum of x the tenyear us treasury rate plus y the creditbased spread for such component as set forth in the mortgage loan agreement plus z 5 exceeds the original interest rate for such component in addition if our 2005 cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by november 2010 then excess cash flow as defined below will be trapped by the trustee and applied first to repay the original cash coupons on the cmbs certificates to fund all reserve accounts fund operating expenses associated with the towers pay the management fees and then to repay principal of the 2005 and the 2006 cmbs certificates in order of their investment grade ie the 20051a and 20061a subclasses would have their respective principal repaid equally prior to repayment of the other subclasses of the cmbs certificates the mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time prior to the anticipated repayment date 

  

the mortgage loan is secured by 1 mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the tower sites and their operating cash flows 2 a security interest in substantially all of the borrowers’ personal property and fixtures 3 the borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they entered into with sba network management inc “sba network management” relating to the management of the borrowers’ tower sites by sba network management pursuant to which sba network management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the borrowers’ behalf 4 the borrowers’ right under certain site management agreements 5 the borrowers’ rights under certain tenant leases 6 the pledge by sba cmbs1 guarantor llc and sba cmbs1 holdings llc of equity interest of the initial borrower and sba cmbs1 guarantor llc 7 the various deposit accounts and collection accounts of the borrowers and 8 all proceeds of the foregoing for each calendar month sba network management is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 75 of the borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month 

in connection with the issuance of the cmbs certificates we established a deposit account into which all rents and other sums due on the cmbs towers are directly deposited by the lessees and are held by the trustee the funds in this deposit account are used to fund a restricted cash amount which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan governing the cmbs certificates to fund certain reserve accounts for the payment of debt service costs ground rents real estate and personal property taxes insurance premiums related to tower sites trustee and service expenses and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the 4969 tower sites based on the terms of the cmbs certificates all rental cash receipts each month are restricted and held by the indenture trustee the monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets the monies held by the indenture trustee in excess of required reserve balances are subsequently released to the borrowers on or before the 15 th calendar day following month end however if the debt service coverage ratio defined as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as “excess cash flow” will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter 

as of december 31 2008 we met the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan agreement

inflation 

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation

 nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as net loss excluding the impact of net interest expenses including amortization of deferred financing fees provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other charges noncash compensation loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt other income and expenses including in 2008 the 133 million otherthantemporary 

  

impairment charge on our auction rate securities nonrecurring acquisition related integration costs associated with the optasite and light tower acquisitions noncash leasing revenue and noncash ground lease expense in addition adjusted ebitda excludes acquisition related costs which are currently capitalized but commencing january 1 2009 is required to be expensed and included within operating expenses pursuant to the adoption of sfas 141r we have included this nongaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income or gross profit margin as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurement of adjusted ebitda has certain material limitations including 

 

  

  

  

 we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results 

the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

 

  

   

segment operating profit 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments segment operating profit is in our opinion an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation accretion and amortization which is largely fixed segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or segment gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations specifically this measurement does not include depreciation accretion and amortization expense as we use capital assets in our business depreciation accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit therefore any measure that excludes depreciation accretion and amortization expense has material limitations we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of the operating performance of our segments

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributed 955 of our segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2007 in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2007 we owned 6220 towers the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers to lease space to wireless service providers we also manage or lease approximately 4500 actual or potential communications sites of which approximately 640 are revenue producing our second business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including alltel att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site tenant leases are generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3– 4 per year including the renewal option periods 

as of december 31 2007 we owned 6220 towers up from 5551 as of december 31 2006 we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio by 5 to 10 in 2008 we intend to meet these growth targets by pursuing new build and tower acquisition opportunities within the parameters of our desired longterm leverage ratios pursuant to these initiatives we built 61 towers and acquired 612 towers during 2007 compared to the year ended 2006 where we built 60 towers and acquired 2189 towers including the 1850 towers acquired through the april 27 2006 acquisition of all the outstanding shares of aat communications corp “aat” which we refer to as the aat acquisition 

in our new build program we construct towers in locations chosen by us under buildtosuit arrangements under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customer’s network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts we intend to have at least one signed tenant lease on each new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants we intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2008 

in our tower acquisition program we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past three years 

 

  

 

 as of december 31 2007 we had 15429 tenants on the 6220 tower sites we owned as of that date or an average of 25 tenants per tower 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit as indicated in the tables below our site leasing business generated 788 of our total revenue during the past year and has represented 95 or more of our total segment operating profit for the past three years 

 

  

 

   

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions 

we provide our site development and construction services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices some of which are opened and closed on a projectbyproject basis the regional offices are responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 23 of our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

industry overview 

we believe that growing wireless traffic the successful recent spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use first consumers continue to push minutes of use higher whether through wireline to wireless migration increasing use of broadband services new data products or simply talking more consumers are demanding quality wireless networks and list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service to decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage second we expect that the rollout of 3g and 4g wireless services by existing carriers will require our customers to add a large number of additional cell sites and increase the amount of their equipment at current cell sites we expect that the federal communications commission’s the “fcc” advanced wireless service spectrum auction 66 for advanced broadband services and the current fcc spectrum auction 73 relating to the auction of the 700 mhz band will provide existing carriers the opportunity to acquire spectrum for 3g and 4g wireless service and will further drive the demand for communication sites finally the third area of growth in the us market comes from new market launches for emerging carriers to get into traditional wireless services or new technologies like wimax for example leap wireless and metro pcs acquired spectrum in auction 66 in new coverage areas that will require brand new networks while clearwire is in the process of building out a nationwide network based on these factors we believe that the us wireless industry is growing wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear trend of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us 

  

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

focusing on site leasing business with stable recurring revenues we intend to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more cyclical by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of tower portfolio  we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio by 5 to 10 during 2008 we intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and longterm and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios furthermore we believe that our tower operations are highly scalable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

controlling our underlying land positions  we have purchased and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future as of december 31 2007 we own or control for a minimum period of fifty years land under 23 of our communication sites 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller regional local or private operators 

  

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

 during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements 

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

  

competition 

site leasing – our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are 1 the large independent tower companies american tower corp crown castle international and global tower partners 2 a large number of smaller independent tower owners 3 wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers and 4 alternative facilities such as rooftops broadcast towers and utility poles there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years specifically american tower corp completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our aat acquisition in 2006 and crown castle international completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle have substantially more towers and greater financial resources than we do wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service to our tenants and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

site development —the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including bechtel corporation black  veach corporation goodman networks nsoro general dynamics corporation and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation geographic reach price and time for completion of a project we believe that our experience base and our established relationships with wireless service providers have allowed us to favorably compete for higher margin site development contracts which has resulted in increasing margins in this segment during 2007 as compared to prior years 

employees 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office our remaining employees are based in our regional and local offices 

as of december 31 2007 we had 617 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

  

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider among other things the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade structures and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers or structures that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc proposals to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights or widths may also require fcc approval a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc standards antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits including fcc radio licenses because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or implementing certain modifications to an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operation of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure modification or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including the need to conduct preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between the exposure to lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws the costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

  

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities often have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of among other things the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2007 we had 265 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 59 million of annual revenue by comparison at december 31 2006 we had 179 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 37 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts as of december 31 2007 we had approximately 406 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately 374 million as of december 31 2006

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks related to our business 

we have a substantial level of indebtedness which we may not have the ability to repay or refinance at commercially reasonable terms or at all 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity the following table sets forth our total debt and shareholders’ equity as of december 31 2006 and december 31 2007 

 

 our indebtedness as of december 31 2007 consists of 1555 billion of commercial mortgagebacked passthrough certificates which we refer to as our cmbs certificates and 3500 million of 0375 convertible senior notes which we refer to as our notes in addition subsequent to december 31 2007 we entered into a 2850 million senior secured revolving credit facility proceeds from the facility may only be used to purchase or construct towers andor purchase the land underlying our towers our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal interest or other amounts when due subject to certain restrictions under our existing indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may also incur significant additional indebtedness in the future some of which may be secured debt this may have the effect of increasing our total leverage 

we will not be able to amortize and repay our substantial indebtedness when due from cash from operating activities upon maturity our indebtedness will need to be repaid from asset sales or equity issuances or will need to be refinanced as a consequence of our indebtedness 1 demands on our cash resources may increase 2 we are subject to restrictive covenants that further limit our financial and operating flexibility and 3 we may choose to institute selfimposed limits on our indebtedness based on certain considerations including market interest rates our relative leverage and our strategic plans for example as a result of our indebtedness 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 these restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development mergers and acquisitions or other opportunities 

  

in addition fluctuations in market interest rates may increase interest expense relating to our floating rate indebtedness which we expect to incur under our senior secured revolving credit facility and may make it difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness including our cmbs certificates at a commercially reasonable rate or at all there is no guarantee future refinancing of our indebtedness will have fixed interest rates or that interest rates on such indebtedness will be equal to or lower than the rates on our current indebtedness 

any slowdown in demand for wireless communications services or for tower space could adversely affect our future growth and revenues 

demand for antenna space on our towers and for our site development services depends on demand for wireless services in 2001 through 2003 economic downturns in the us economy including the wireless telecommunications industry negatively influenced demand for tower space and site development services similar slowdowns in the future may adversely affect 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 as a result of these factors wireless service providers may delay or abandon implementation of new systems and technologies including 3g 4g or other wireless services or worse elect not to renew existing antenna leases in order to reduce operating expenses 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business as expected this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate or fail to renew existing leases for tower space because many of their existing networks and expansion plans may overlap as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers specifically cingular acquired att wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005 as a result of the cingularatt wireless merger as of december 31 2007 att had terminated 164 tenant leases with us which had 40 million of annualized rental revenue on towers where both cingular and att wireless had previously had antennas in addition att did not renew certain tenant leases for other communication sites in close proximity to the extent that it believed it did not need the additional capacity although we have not currently experienced any significant amount of churn as a result of the sprintnextel merger due primarily to the different 

  

technologies utilized and their decision to operate two networks we may in the future experience terminations andor nonrenewals due to this merger furthermore to the extent that other wireless service providers consolidate in the future they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as much space on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness 

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communication sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies or slowing consumer adoption rates may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries the announcement of 4g is relatively new and its deployment has been limited to date additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue therefore if any of our significant customers reduced their demand for tower space or became financially unstable it may materially decrease our revenues 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers the loss of any one of our significant customers as a result of bankruptcy consolidation merger with other customers of ours or otherwise could materially decrease our revenue and have an adverse effect on our growth 

the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenue for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

   

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

  

 revenue from these clients is derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant however if any of our significant site leasing clients were to experience financial difficulty substantially reduce their capital expenditures or reduce their dependence on leased tower space and fail to renew their leases with us our revenues future revenue growth and results of operations would be adversely affected 

our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive competitive pressures for tenants from our competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues margins and financial condition 

  

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

  

 there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years specifically american tower corp completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our aat acquisition in 2006 and crown castle international completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and may have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

the site development segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment continue to be under pressure many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility which could adversely impact our ability to use equity to fund our growth plan 

the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors including the other factors discussed elsewhere in “risk factors” and in “forwardlooking statements” volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock when they want or at attractive prices consequently volatility of the market price of our class a common stock may make it less likely that sellers will accept our equity as consideration in connection with our tower acquisitions and may make it more difficult for us to use our equity to fund our future growth plans if we were unable to use equity to fund growth of our tower portfolio we may be required to either use debt to increase our tower portfolio or reduce our anticipated growth 

increasing competition to acquire existing towers may negatively impact our ability to grow our tower portfolio at anticipated rates 

we currently intend to grow our tower portfolio 5 to 10 annually through acquisitions and new builds our ability to meet these growth targets significantly depends on our ability to acquire existing towers that meet our investment requirements traditionally our acquisition strategy has focused on acquiring towers from smaller tower companies independent tower developers and wireless service providers however as a result of consolidation in the tower industry there are fewer of these midsized tower transactions available and there is more competition to acquire existing towers increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition opportunities for us higher acquisition prices reduced willingness of sellers to accept equity as consideration for 

  

their towers and increased difficulty in negotiating and consummating agreements to acquire such towers furthermore to the extent that the tower acquisition opportunities are for significant tower portfolios many of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

we may not be able to build as many towers as we anticipate 

we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2008 however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2008 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

risks associated with our plans to increase our tower portfolio could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition 

we currently intend to increase our tower portfolio through new builds and acquisitions we intend to review available acquisition opportunities and some of these acquisitions could have the effect of materially increasing our tower portfolio while we intend to fund a portion of the cash required to implement this plan from our cash flow from operating activities we may finance some or all of the costs associated with these new builds and acquisitions furthermore if we were to consummate any significant acquisition we might be required to finance these acquisitions through additional indebtedness which would increase our indebtedness and interest expense and could increase our leverage ratio andor issuances of equity which could be dilutive to our shareholders if we were unable to recognize the expected returns from these new towers or if we did not recognize the expected returns in our anticipated time frames an increase in debt levels without a proportionate increase in our revenues could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition 

our shortterm investments portfolio contains auction rate securities that we may not be able to liquidate at their market value or at all 

we previously invested a portion of our liquidity in auction rate securities credit concerns in the capital markets have significantly reduced our ability to liquidate some of the auction rate securities that we classify as shortterm investments in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet these securities represent interests in contingent capital structures corporate credit default swaps and redundant reserve life insurance structures none of the underlying collateral for the auction rate securities we held consisted of subprime residential or commercial mortgages as a result of our assessment of a number of factors including without limitation market conditions and the credit quality of these securities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 we recorded an otherthantemporary impairment charge of 156 million to reduce the value of our auction rate securities to their estimated fair value of 551 million as of december 31 2007 as of february 22 2008 we still own auction rate securities with a par value of 298 million and a current estimated fair value of 142 million 

due to the lack of a secondary market for our auction rate securities the established fair value of these securities is a matter of judgment if our estimates regarding the fair value of these securities are incorrect a future otherthantemporary impairment charge may be required in the future the credit markets may continue to deteriorate causing further declines in the value of the securities which could lead to additional otherthantemporary impairment charges being reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 

  

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business by limiting our flexibility 

our senior secured revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 these covenants could place us at a disadvantage compared to some of our competitors which may have fewer restrictive covenants and may not be required to operate under these restrictions further these covenants could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing new tower development merger and acquisitions or other opportunities if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under the senior secured revolving credit facility in addition if we default in the payment of our other indebtedness including under our cmbs certificates and our notes then such default could cause a crossdefault under our senior secured revolving credit facility 

the mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates also contains financial covenants that require that the mortgage loan borrowers maintain on a consolidated basis a minimum debt service coverage ratio to the extent that the debt service coverage as of the end of any calendar quarter 1 is less than 130 times all cash flow generated by the pledged towers must be deposited into a reserve account and 2 is less than 115 times then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter as lease payments from 4975 towers of our total tower portfolio are pledged as collateral under the mortgage loan if this cash flow was not available to us it would adversely impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the same communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antenna” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space 

  

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us additionally the borrowers on the mortgage loan supporting the cmbs certificates must repay the components of the mortgage loan if such borrowers’ cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4975 tower sites that secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan other than the cash required to repay amounts due under the cmbs certificates we currently expect that substantially all the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to repay our notes the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs certificates other than those entities obligated under the cmbs certificates or make any funds available to us for payment the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us is restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of the senior secured revolving credit facility and the cmbs certificates 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

  

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following table shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to depreciation amortization and accretion expenses interest expense including noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees and losses from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer thomas p hunt our chief administrative officer and general counsel and anthony j macaione our senior vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the federal communications commission the “fcc” the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the federal aviation administration “faa” and federal communications commission “fcc” regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures to modify existing towers or structures or to use the towers or structures to operate on a certain frequency or frequency band are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure or its use will not present a hazard to air navigation 

  

antenna tower and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction certain proposals to construct or modify antenna towers and structures or to operate wireless communications or radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and antenna structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to incur significant expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders we adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

  

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

future sales of our class a common stock in the public market or the issuance of other equity may cause dilution or adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity or equityrelated offerings 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities in the public market including sales by any selling shareholder or conversion of the notes could depress the market price of our class a common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities we cannot predict the effect that future sales of our class a common stock or other equityrelated securities would have on the market price of our class a common stock

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “special note regarding forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributes approximately 96 of our segment operating profit in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2007 we owned 6220 towers we also manage or lease approximately 4500 actual or potential communications sites of which approximately 640 are revenue producing our second business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including alltel att sprint tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site each tenant lease is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five fiveyear renewal periods at the option of the tenant these tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators which average 3—4 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing lastly land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3—4 annually or provide for term escalators of approximately 15 

  

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit the table below details the percentage of our total revenues and segment operating profit contributed by the site leasing business 

 

  

 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use network expansion and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development business is complimentary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition technical services and construction 

site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of this project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 

our revenue from site development construction contracts is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

  

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting contracts and construction contracts are recognized as incurred 

the table below provides the percentage of our total revenues contributed by site development services over the last three years information regarding the total assets used in our site development services businesses is included in note 23 of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

 

 critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2007 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

shortterm investments 

we classify auction rate securities as shortterm investments due to the short interest rate reset period auction rate securities are debt instruments with longterm scheduled maturities but have interest rates that are typically reset at predetermined intervals usually every 7 28 35 or 90 days at which time the securities can typically be purchased or sold creating a liquid market the rate reset for each instrument is an opportunity to accept the reset rate or sell the instrument at its face value in order to seek an alternative investment in the past the auction process has allowed investors to roll over their holdings or obtain immediate liquidity by selling the securities at par we do not intend to hold these securities to maturity but rather to use the interest rate reset feature to provide the opportunity to maximize returns while preserving liquidity due to the liquidity provided by the interest rate reset mechanism and the shortterm nature of our investment in these securities they have been classified as shortterm investments available for sale in current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 

  

typically the fair value of auction rate securities approximates par value due to the frequent resets through the auction rate process in recent months auctions associated with these securities have failed as a result of there not being any demand in the marketplace we estimated the fair value of these auction rate securities based on a subsequent sale of certain auction rate securities at par value and estimated values provided by the firm managing our auction rate investments management validated the assumptions used in the valuation including the ultimate time horizon and coupon rate for these securities the credit worthiness of the underlying assets and the counterparties and the appropriate discount margins due to the lack of a secondary market for our auction rate securities the established fair value of these securities is a matter of judgment if our estimates regarding the fair value of these securities are incorrect a future otherthantemporary impairment charge may be required additionally these estimated fair values could change significantly based on future market conditions and as such we may be required to record additional unrealized losses for impairment if we determine there are further declines in fair value 

we reviewed the impairment charge in accordance with eitf 031 “the meaning of otherthantemporary impairment and its application to certain investments ” and staff accounting bulletin topic 5m “otherthantemporary impairment of certain investments in debt and equity securities” to determine the classification of the impairment as “temporary” or “otherthantemporary” a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders’ equity it occurs if a loss in an investment is determined to be temporary in nature and we have the ability and intent to hold the investment until a recovery in market value takes place such an unrealized loss does not reduce our net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as otherthantemporary an impairment charge is recorded against earnings to the extent we determine that there is a loss of fair value that is otherthantemporary we have determined that the entire impairment related to our auction rate securities was other–than–temporary and recorded an impairment charge in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations based on a variety of factors including the significant decline in fair value indicated for the individual investments and the adverse market conditions impacting auction rate securities in addition as of december 31 2007 we intend to liquidate these securities within the next twelve months and do not believe that the current state of the credit markets requires us to reclassify them as longterm marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheets 

construction revenue 

revenue from construction projects is recognized using the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or the intangible asset has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

results of operations 

year ended 2007 compared to year ended 2006 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased 656 million due to an increase in the number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our historical towers and from revenue generated by the towers that we acquired in our april 2006 acquisition of aat communications corporation “aat” and the other towers we acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2005 the 1850 aat towers were only owned for eight months for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the entire year ended december 31 2007 the aat towers contributed approximately 986 million of the total revenues for the fiscal year ended december 31 2007 compared to approximately 632 million for the same period of 2006 an increase of approximately 354 million as of december 31 2007 we had 15429 tenants as compared to 13602 tenants at december 31 2006 additionally we 

  

have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher annual rents upon renewal by existing tenants and increased rental rates associated with additional equipment added by existing tenants 

site development consulting revenue increased 77 million as a result of a higher volume of work for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the same period of 2006 the higher volume of work was primarily due to services provided in connection with sprint’s development of its network 

site development construction revenue decreased 162 million due to the wind down or completion of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless service providers as well as a significant decline in the volume of work performed for att during 2007 as compared to the same period in the prior year 

operating expenses 

 

 site leasing cost of revenues increased 173 million primarily as a result of the aat towers and the growth in the number of towers owned by us which was 6220 at december 31 2007 up from 5551 at december 31 2006 the aat towers contributed approximately 278 million to the total site leasing cost of revenues for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to approximately 196 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of approximately 82 million 

site development consulting cost of revenues increased 52 million as a result of higher volume of work for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the same period of 2006 largely due to services provided during 2007 in connection with sprint’s development of its network site development construction cost of revenue decreased 158 million due to the wind down or completion of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless service providers as well as a significant decline in the volume of work performed for att for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the same period in the prior year 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 33 million primarily as a result of an increase in salaries benefits and other back office expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees a significant portion of which is attributable to the aat acquisition selling general and administrative expenses were also impacted by 63 million of stock option and employee stock purchase plan expense that we recognized for the year ended december 31 2007 in accordance with sfas 123r as compared to 53 million in the comparable period in 2006 an increase of 10 million 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 361 million to 1692 million for the year ended december 31 2007 from 1331 million for the year ended december 31 2006 approximately 712 million was associated with the aat towers for the year ended december 31 2007 versus approximately 464 million for the comparable period in 2006 an increase of approximately 248 million 

  

operating income 

operating income was 300 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 195 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase of 105 million is primarily the result of higher revenues without a commensurate increase in cost of revenues in the site leasing and site development consulting segments offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation accretion and amortization expense 

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 483 million is primarily related to additional revenue generated by the increased number of towers acquired in the aat acquisition the aat towers contributed approximately 708 million of the total site leasing segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to approximately 436 million for the year ended december 31 2006 an increase of approximately 272 million the remaining increase in our site leasing segment operating profit is due to increased revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites for the year ended december 31 2007 versus the same period in 2006 without a commensurate increase in site leasing cost of revenue we reconcile these nongaap financial measures and provide the regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section titled nongaap financial measures 

other income expense 

 

 interest income increased 64 million for the year ended december 31 2007 when compared to the year ended december 31 2006 the increase is primarily the result of investment earnings on the net proceeds of the convertible senior notes the “notes” offering completed at the end of the first quarter of 2007 

interest expense for the year ended december 31 2007 increased 112 million from the year ended december 31 2006 this increase is primarily due to the higher weighted average amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 which is partially offset by a reduction in our weighted average cash interest rate for the same periods specifically 1 our 11 billion bridge loan for the aat acquisition was only outstanding for seven months of the year ended december 31 2006 and was not outstanding during any portion of the year ended 

  

december 31 2007 while the 115 billion cmbs certificates issued in 2006 which were used to refinance the bridge loan were outstanding for a little over one month for the year ended december 31 2006 and were outstanding for the full year ended december 31 2007 and 2 we had 3500 million of additional debt outstanding for nine months in 2007 consisting of our notes compared to none in the year ended december 31 2006 

there was no noncash interest for the year ended december 31 2007 compared to 68 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease was a result of the repurchase of all of the outstanding 9 3  4  senior discount notes in april 2006 

amortization of deferred financing fees decreased by 31 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to the year ended december 31 2006 this decrease was primarily a result of fully amortizing fees relating to the 16 billion of cmbs certificates over a period of five years with one year of amortization during the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to fully amortizing fees on the 11 billion bridge loan over nine months with seven months of amortization during the year ended december 31 2006 

the loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was 04 million for the year ended december 31 2007 associated with the termination of the senior revolving credit facility in april 2007 this amount was 572 million for the year ended december 31 2006 associated with the loss from writeoff of 102 million of deferred financing fees and 470 million of losses on extinguishment of debt resulting from the prepayment of the 11 billion bridge loan in november 2006 and the repurchase of the 8 1  2  senior notes and 9 3  4  senior discount notes in april 2006 

other expense of 158 million includes an otherthantemporary impairment loss on shortterm investments of 156 million for the year ended december 31 2007 associated with our investments in auction rate securities see discussion in “liquidity and capital resources” in part ii item 7 as well as note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our investments in auction rate securities and this otherthantemporary impairment charge 

adjusted ebitda 

adjusted ebitda was 2094 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1618 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the increase of 476 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment largely driven from the aat acquisition we reconcile this measure and other regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled nongaap financial measures 

net loss 

net loss was 779 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 1334 million for the year ended december 31 2006 the decrease of 555 million is primarily the result of the decrease in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt 

  

year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased 949 million due to the increased number of new tenant installations the amount of lease amendments related to equipment added to our towers revenue generated by the towers that we acquired in the aat acquisition and other towers acquired or constructed subsequent to december 31 2005 the aat acquisition contributed approximately 632 million of the increase in total revenues as of december 31 2006 we had 13602 tenants as compared to 8278 tenants at december 31 2005 additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenants due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants lastly we added 2249 towers to our portfolio in 2006 versus only adding 244 towers in 2005 

site development consulting revenues increased 31 million as a result of a higher volume of work in 2006 versus 2005 site development construction revenue decreased due to the rolloff of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless carriers and our efforts to focus on capturing higher margin services work rather than volume 

operating expenses 

 

 site leasing cost of revenues increased 234 million primarily as a result of the growth in the number of towers owned by us which was 5551 at december 31 2006 up from 3304 at december 31 2005 the aat acquisition contributed approximately 196 million to the increase in total site leasing cost of revenues site development consulting cost of revenues increased by 21 million as a result of higher volume of work for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the same period of 2005 site development construction cost of revenue decreased by 88 million due to the rolloff of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless carriers and our efforts to focus on capturing higher margin services work rather than volume that focus and changing market conditions for the year ended december 31 2006 resulted in higher margin jobs in 2006 versus 2005 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 141 million which was due to a 69 million increase in salaries benefits and other back office operating expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees a significant portion of which is attributable to the aat acquisition selling general and administrative expenses were also impacted by 53 million of 

  

stock option and employee stock purchase plan expense that we recognized in 2006 in accordance with sfas 123r as compared to 05 million in 2005 the remaining portion of the increase was due to 23 million of bonus transition and integration expenses incurred in connection with the aat acquisition these bonus transition and integration expenses are not expected to recur in future years 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased 459 million primarily due to expense on assets acquired in the aat acquisition which represented approximately 464 million offset by the decrease in certain towers becoming fully depreciated since december 31 2005 

operating income 

operating income was 195 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 42 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase of 153 million is primarily due to increases in the segment operating profit see below of the site leasing segment which was primarily due to an increased number of towers acquired in the aat acquisition this increase was further augmented by an increase in segment operating profit of the site development construction segment which was due to the rolloff of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless carriers which were at lower margins than subsequent work that was at higher margins these increases were offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expenses and depreciation accretion and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the year ended december 31 2005 

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit of 715 million is primarily related to additional revenue generated by the increased number of towers acquired in the aat acquisition which contributed approximately 436 million of the increase the remaining increase is primarily due to the revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites in 2006 versus 2005 which have minimal incremental associated costs we reconcile this measure and provide other regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled nongaap financial measures 

  

other income expense 

 

 interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 408 million from the year ended december 31 2005 this increase is primarily due to the higher aggregate amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding during 2006 which consisted of the 11 billion bridge loan during the second third and a portion of the fourth quarters of 2006 and 405 million of cmbs certificates issued in 2005 were outstanding for all twelve months of 2006 and 115 billion of cmbs certificates issued in 2006 were outstanding for the last two months of 2006 versus an average balance of 5876 million of interest bearing debt in 2005 which was primarily comprised of our 8 1  2  senior notes our senior secured credit facility and the initial cmbs certificates 

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 decreased 194 million from the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was a result of the redemption and repurchase of 1118 million of 9 3  4  senior discount notes in june and november of 2005 and the repurchase of the remaining aggregate principal amount of 2237 million of these notes in april 2006 

amortization of deferred financing fees increased 87 million from the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to amortization of fees relating to the 11 billion bridge loan the 115 billion of cmbs certificates issued in 2006 the 4050 million of cmbs certificates issued in 2005 and the senior revolving credit facility versus the amortization of fees on outstanding 8 1  2  senior notes 9 3  4  senior discount notes and the senior secured credit facility for the year ended december 31 2005 

loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2006 was 572 million an increase of 280 million from the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was attributable to the loss from writeoff of 102 million of deferred financing fees and 470 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the repayment of the 11 billion of the bridge loan in november 2006 repurchase of 2237 million of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and 1625 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes in april 2006 versus the loss from writeoff of 23 million of deferred financing fees and 109 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt associated with the redemption of 1118 million of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes the writeoff of 17 million of deferred financing fees and 74 million of losses from the writeoff of 875 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes the writeoff of 54 million of deferred financing fees associated with the repayment and refinancing of our prior senior credit facility and the writeoff of 08 million of deferred financing fees and 07 million on the extinguishment of debt associated with the redemption of 500 million of our 10 1  4  bonds during 2005 

  

adjusted ebitda 

the adjusted ebitda was 1618 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 953 million for the year ended december 31 2005 the increase of 665 million is primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure we reconcile this measure and provide other regulation g disclosures in this annual report in the section entitled nongaap financial measures 

net loss 

net loss was 1334 million for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to 947 million for the year ended december 31 2005  the increase of 387 million is primarily a result of higher interest expense an increase in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt and higher amortization of deferred financing fees offset by improved operating income and lower noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 

liquidity and capital resources 

sba communications corporation “sba communications” is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications inc “telecommunications” which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of sba senior finance inc “sba senior finance” which directly or indirectly owns the equity interest in substantially all of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through our sba senior finance subsidiaries primarily the borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the cmbs certificates and sba senior finance ii llc accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries 

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

 

 sources of liquidity 

we have traditionally funded our growth including our tower portfolio growth through longterm indebtedness and equity issuances in addition we also fund our growth with cash flows from operations 

during 2005 and 2006 we began to utilize the commercial mortgage backed securities market to refinance our debt as it provided us an opportunity to capitalize on the long term nature of the revenue stream from our tower portfolio to reduce our weighted average cost of interest 

on march 26 2007 we issued 3500 million of our 0375 convertible senior notes due in 2010 semiannual interest payments on the notes are due each june 1 and december 1 beginning june 1 2007 the maturity date of the notes is december 1 2010 the notes are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of 297992 shares per 1000 principal amount of notes subject to certain customary adjustments which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 3356 per share or a 19 conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of 2820 per share of class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market on march 20 2007 the notes are only convertible under certain 

  

specified circumstances upon conversion we have the right to settle the conversion of each 1000 principal amount of notes with either of the three following alternatives at our option delivery of 1 297992 shares of our class a common stock 2 cash equal to the value of 297992 shares of our class a common stock calculated at the market price per share of our class a common stock at the time of conversion or 3 a combination of cash and shares of our class a common stock 

the net proceeds from this offering were approximately 3414 million after deducting discounts commissions and expenses a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes was used to repurchase approximately 324 million shares of our class a common stock at a price of 2820 per share or approximately 912 million which shares were subsequently retired 

cash provided by operating activities was 1229 million for the year ended december 31 2007 as compared to 737 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this increase was primarily the result of segment operating profit from the site leasing segment net of interest expense and selling general and administrative expenses 

in january 2008 sba senior finance entered into a 2850 million senior secured revolving credit facility the facility may be borrowed repaid and redrawn subject to compliance with certain covenants proceeds available under the facility may only be used for the construction or acquisition of towers and for ground lease buyouts amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points based on consolidated total debt to annualized sba senior finance’s ebitda ratio calculated excluding the impact from the borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the cmbs certificates amounts borrowed under this facility will be secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba communications’ telecommunications’ and sba senior finance’s assets not previously pledged under the cmbs certificates and substantially all of the subsidiary guarantors’ assets and are guaranteed by sba communications telecommunications and the subsidiary guarantors subject to compliance with certain covenants the facility does not restrict 1 the payment by senior finance to us of funds generated from operations 2 the use of those funds by us and 3 the incurrence of additional indebtedness by us 

in order to manage our leverage position and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may decide to pursue a variety of actions these actions may include the issuance of additional indebtedness to stay at target leverage levels selling certain assets or lines of business issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or pursuing other financing alternatives including securitization transactions if implemented these actions could increase our interest expense andor dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that we will implement any of these strategies or that if implemented these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to us and our shareholders

uses of liquidity 

our principal use of liquidity is cash capital expenditures associated with the growth of our tower portfolio our cash capital expenditures including cash used for acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2007 were 2292 million the 2292 million included cash capital expenditures of 1780 million that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of 612 completed towers the remaining equity interest in one tower that we previously owned a 50 interest in and earnouts for the year ended december 31 2007 net of related prorated rental receipts and payments this amount also includes 155 million related to new tower construction 54 million for maintenance tower capital expenditures 55 million for augmentations and tower upgrades 14 million for general corporate expenditures and 234 million for ground lease purchases the 155 million of new tower construction included costs associated with the completion of 61 new towers for the year ended december 31 2007 and costs incurred on sites currently in process 

we currently expect to incur capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of 65 million to 85 million during 2008 based upon our current plans we expect discretionary cash capital expenditures during 2008 to be 1700 million to 1900 million primarily these cash capital expenditures relate to the 80 to 100 towers we intend to build in 2008 ground lease purchases and current acquisition plans including as of february 21 2008 the 47 towers acquired since december 31 2007 and the 179 towers that are subject to pending acquisition agreements 

we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build program and tower acquisition program and our ground lease purchase program

debt instruments 

cmbs certificates 

on november 18 2005 sba cmbs1 depositor llc the “depositor” an indirect subsidiary of ours sold in a private transaction 4050 million of initial cmbs certificates issued by sba cmbs trust the “trust” the sole assets of the trust are a nonrecourse mortgage loan in which sba properties inc “sba properties” was the initial borrower the mortgage loan consists of multiple tranches or components each of which has terms that are identical to the subclass of cmbs certificates to which it relates sba properties and each of the additional borrowers defined below added to the mortgage in connection with the issuance of the additional cmbs certificates are special purpose vehicles which exist solely to hold the towers which are subject to the securitization 

the initial cmbs certificates consist of five classes all of which are rated investment grade with a principal balance and pass through interest rate as indicated in the table below 

 

 the weighted average monthly fixed coupon interest rate of the initial cmbs certificates is 56 and the effective weighted average fixed interest rate is 48 after giving effect to a settlement of two interest rate swap agreements entered in contemplation of the transaction the initial cmbs certificates have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in 2035 the proceeds of the initial cmbs certificates were primarily used to purchase the prior senior credit facility of sba senior finance and to fund reserves and pay expenses associated with the offering 

on november 6 2006 the depositor sold in a private transaction 115 billion of additional cmbs certificates issued by the trust the additional cmbs certificates consist of nine classes with a principal balance and pass through interest rate for each class as indicated in the table below 

 

 the weighted average monthly fixed coupon interest rate of the additional cmbs certificates is 60 and the effective weighted average fixed interest rate is 63 after giving effect to the settlement of the nine interest rate swap agreements entered in contemplation of the transaction the additional cmbs certificates have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in 2036 the proceeds of the additional cmbs certificates were primarily used to repay the bridge loan incurred with the acquisition of aat and to fund required reserves and expenses associated with the additional cmbs transaction 

  

in connection with the issuance of the additional cmbs certificates each of sba sites inc sba structures inc sba towers inc sba puerto rico inc and sba towers usvi inc the “additional borrowers” and collectively with the initial borrower the “borrowers” were added as additional borrowers under the mortgage loan and the principal amount of the mortgage loan was increased by 115 billion to an aggregate of 156 billion the borrowers are jointly and severally liable under the mortgage loan the mortgage loan is to be paid from the operating cash flows from the aggregate 4975 towers owned by the borrowers subject to certain limited exceptions described below no payments of principal will be required to be made for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates prior to the monthly payment date in november 2010 which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates and no payments of principal will be required to be made for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates prior to the monthly payment date in november 2011 which is the anticipated repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates 

the borrowers may not prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part at any time prior to 1 november 2010 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates and 2 november 2011 for the components of the mortgage loan corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates except in limited circumstances such as the occurrence of certain casualty and condemnation events relating to the borrowers’ tower sites thereafter prepayment is permitted provided it is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration if the prepayment occurs within nine months of the anticipated repayment date no prepayment consideration is due the entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan components corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates will be due in november 2035 and those corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates will be due in november 2036 however to the extent that the full amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the initial cmbs certificates or the amount of the mortgage loan component corresponding to the additional cmbs certificates are not fully repaid by their respective anticipated repayment dates the interest rate of each component would increase by approximately 5 plus any difference between the contractual weighted average monthly fixed interest rate in effect at the time of issuance of the cmbs certificates and the then current weighted average monthly fixed interest rate the mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time 

the mortgage loan is secured by 1 mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the borrowers’ tower sites and their operating cash flows 2 a security interest in substantially all of the borrowers’ personal property and fixtures and 3 the borrowers’ rights under the management agreement entered into with sba network management inc “sba network management” relating to the management of the borrowers’ tower sites by sba network management pursuant to which sba network management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the borrowers’ behalf for each calendar month sba network management is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 75 of the borrowers’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month this management fee was reduced from 10 in connection with the issuance of the additional cmbs certificates 

in connection with the issuance of the cmbs certificates we are required to fund a restricted cash amount which represents the cash held in escrow pursuant to the mortgage loan governing the cmbs certificates to fund certain reserve accounts for the payment of debt service costs ground rents real estate and personal property taxes insurance premiums related to tower sites trustee and service expenses and to reserve a portion of advance rents from tenants on the 4975 tower sites based on the terms of the cmbs certificates all rental cash receipts each month are restricted and held by the indenture trustee the monies held by the indenture trustee are classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets the monies held by the indenture trustee in excess of required reserve balances are subsequently released to the borrowers on or before the 15 th calendar day following month end however if the debt service coverage ratio defined as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the 

  

amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as excess cash flow will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan until such time as the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 115 times for a calendar quarter otherwise on a monthly basis the excess cash flow of the borrowers held by the trustee after payment of principal interest reserves and expenses is distributed to the borrowers as of december 31 2007 we met the required debt service coverage ratio as defined by the mortgage loan agreement 

0375 convertible senior notes due 2010 

on march 26 2007 we issued 3500 million of our 0375 convertible senior notes due 2010 interest is payable semiannually on june 1 and december 1 beginning june 1 2007 the maturity date of the notes is december 1 2010 the notes are convertible at the holder’s option into shares of our class a common stock at an initial conversion rate of 297992 shares per 1000 principal amount of notes subject to certain customary adjustments which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately 3356 per share or a 19 conversion premium based on the last reported sale price of 2820 per share of class a common stock on the nasdaq global select market on march 20 2007 the notes are only convertible under the following circumstances 

 

  

  

  

 upon conversion we have the right to settle the conversion of each 1000 principal amount of notes with either of the three following alternatives at our option delivery of 1 297992 shares of our class a common stock 2 cash equal to the value of 297992 shares of our class a common stock calculated at the market price per share of our class a common stock at the time of conversion or 3 a combination of cash and shares of our class a common stock 

concurrently with the sale of the notes we entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we purchased from affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the notes an option covering 10429720 shares of our class a common stock at an initial price of 3356 per share separately and concurrently with the sale of the notes we entered into sold warrant transactions whereby we sold to affiliates of two of the initial purchasers of the notes warrants to acquire 10429720 shares of our class a common stock at an initial exercise price of 5500 per share the convertible note hedge transactions and the sold warrant transactions taken as a whole effectively increase the conversion price of the notes from 3356 per share to 5500 per share as we can not determine when or whether the notes will be converted the convertible note hedge transactions and the sold warrant transactions taken as a whole minimize the liquidity risk associated with early conversion of the notes until such time that our class a common stock is trading at a price above 5500 per share the upper strike of the sold warrants

inflation 

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results particularly in light of the fact that our site leasing revenues are governed by longterm contracts with predetermined pricing that we will not be able to increase in response to increases in inflation 

  

recent accounting pronouncements 

in december 2007 the financial accounting standard board “fasb” issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 141r “business combinations” “sfas no 141r” which requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to record all assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their respective acquisitiondate fair values and changes other practices under sfas no 141 some of which could have a material impact on how we account for business combinations these changes include among other things expensing acquisition costs as incurred as a component of selling general and administrative expense we presently capitalize these acquisition costs sfas no 141r also requires additional disclosure of information surrounding a business combination such that users of the entity’s financial statements can fully understand the nature and financial impact of business combinations sfas no 141r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2008 we are currently evaluating what impact the adoption of sfas no 141 r will have on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in december 2007 fasb issued sfas no 160 “noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements” “sfas no 160” which requires entities to report noncontrolling minority interest in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements the adoption of sfas no 160 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flows 

in february 2007 fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard “sfas” no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities – including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” “sfas no 159” which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at their fair values the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement which is consistent with fasb’s longterm measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments sfas no 159 is effective for us on january 1 2008 the adoption of sfas no 159 is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial conditions results of operations or cash flows 

in september 2006 fasb issued sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements sfas no 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2007 except for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november 15 2008 we are currently evaluating what impact if any the adoption of sfas no 157 will have on our consolidated financial condition results of operations or cash flow

 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk tableend we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by only carrying longterm fixed rate debt at december 31 2007 

the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and interest rates associated with our longterm debt instruments assuming our actual level of longterm indebtedness as of december 31 2007 

 

  

 our current primary market risk exposure relates to 1 the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to refinance the cmbs certificates at their expected repayment dates or at maturity at market rates and 2 our ability to meet financial covenants we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding debt through our use of fixed rate debt while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 

we also face market risk exposure associated with our investment in auction rate securities the current conditions in the credit markets have resulted in an otherthantemporary impairment of these securities of 156 million as of december 31 2007 continued deterioration in the credit and equity markets continued failed auctions or the lack of a developing secondary market may all potentially cause further impairment in the value of these securities or negatively impact our ability to liquidate these securities 

our whollyowned subsidiary sba senior finance obtained a threeyear senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 2850 million based on compliance with certain financial ratios on january 18 2008 amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from 150 basis points to 300 basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from 50 basis points to 200 basis points based on consolidated total debt to annualized sba senior finance ebitda ratio excluding the impact from the borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the cmbs certificates consequently in the future we will be subject to interest rate risk on those floating rate loans that are outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations excluding the impact of net interest expense including amortization of deferred financing fees provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other credits charges noncash compensation loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt other income and expense including in the fourth quarter of 2007 the 156 million otherthantemporary impairment charge on our auction rate securities noncash leasing revenue noncash ground lease expense and onetime costs related to transition and integration costs in connection with the aat acquisition we have included this nongaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the profitability and performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurement of adjusted ebitda has certain material limitations including 

 

  

  

  

  

 we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results 

  

the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

 

 segment operating profit 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the three segments segment operating profit is in our opinion an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization which is largely fixed segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations specifically this measurement does not include depreciation accretion and amortization expense as we use capital assets in our business depreciation accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit therefore any measure that excludes depreciation accretion and amortization expense has material limitations we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of the operating performance of our segments 

the reconciliation of site leasing segment operating profit site development consulting segment operating profit and site development construction segment operating profit are as follows

 item1 business tableend general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributes over 90 of our segment operating profit in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2006 we owned 5551 towers we also manage or lease over 5700 actual or potential communications sites of which 785 are revenue producing our second business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

on april 27 2006 we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of aat communications corp “aat” from aat holdings llc ii which we refer to as the aat acquisition the total consideration paid was i 6340 million in cash and ii 17059336 newly issued shares of our class a common stock simultaneously with the closing of the aat acquisition we repurchased 100 of the aggregate outstanding amount of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and 100 of the aggregate outstanding amount of our 8 1  2  senior notes pursuant to tender offers and consent solicitations for an aggregate of 4382 million including accrued interest on the 8 1  2    senior notes and the accreted amount applicable to the 9 3  4  senior discount notes we funded these repurchases including the associated premiums and fees and the cash consideration paid in the aat acquisition with a 11 billion bridge loan on november 6 2006 we issued 115 billion of commercial mortgage pass through certificates series 20061 the “additional cmbs certificates” and used a substantial portion of the proceeds to repay the bridge loan in full 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts we lease antenna space on the towers we have constructed the towers we have acquired the towers we lease sublease andor manage for third parties and on other communications sites that we manage our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless service provider tenants including alltel cingular now att sprint nextel tmobile and verizon wireless we believe our current tower portfolio positions us to take advantage of wireless service providers’ antenna and equipment deployment 

as of december 31 2006 we owned 5551 towers up from 3304 as of december 31 2005 we are currently pursuing new build and tower acquisition programs within the parameters of our desired longterm leverage ratios pursuant to these new initiatives we built 60 towers and acquired 2189 towers during 2006 including the 1850 towers acquired through the aat acquisition 

in our new build program we construct towers either under buildtosuit arrangements or in locations chosen by us in either case after building a tower we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower under buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified when we construct towers in locations chosen by us we utilize our knowledge of our customer’s network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need or will need to locate antennas to meet capacity or service demands we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts our intent is that substantially all of our new builds will have at least one signed tenant lease on the day that it is completed and we expect that some will have multiple tenants we intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2007 

in our tower acquisition program we intend to pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns within our desired leverage ratios for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include projections of a fiveyear unlevered internal rate of return review of available capacity for future lease up projections and a summary of the current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past five years 

 

  as of december 31 2006 we had 13602 tenants on these 5551 towers or an average of 25 tenants per tower our lease contracts typically have terms of five years or more with multiple term tenant renewal options and provide for annual rent escalators 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit as indicated in the chart below our site leasing business generates 73 of our total revenue and represents 95 of our segment operating profit 

 

  site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to 1 keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and 2 capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

  

in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

focusing on site leasing business with stable recurring revenues we intend to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more reactive to changes in industry conditions by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of tower portfolio  we intend to use our available equity free cash flow and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and longterm and which allow us to maintain our longterm target leverage ratios furthermore we believe that our tower operations are highly scaleable consequently we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling general and administrative expenses 

controlling expense base  we have and intend to continue to purchase andor enter into longterm leases for the land that underlies our towers to the extent available at commercially reasonable prices we believe that these purchases andor longterm leases will increase our margins improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

  

industry developments 

we believe that growing wireless traffic the successful recent spectrum auctions and technology developments will require wireless service providers to alter their network structure increase their network capacity and consequently the number and types of antennae sites that they use first consumers continue to push minutes of use higher whether through wireline to wireless migration increasing use of broadband services new data products or simply talking more than they used to consumers are demanding quality wireless networks and have cited network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service to decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth wireless carriers have made steady capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage second we expect that the rollout of 3g wireless services announced plans by a major wireless services provider to deploy a new 4g network and additional investment by other carriers in their existing networks will require our customers to add a large number of additional cell sites and amend their installations at current cell sites we expect that the recent fcc advanced wireless service spectrum auction 66 for advanced broadband services will further drive the robust demand for tower space much of the spectrum was successfully won by the established nationwide carriers such as tmobile sprint nextel as well as cingular now att and verizon with respect to tmobile the auction gives them an opportunity to build new cell sites around the country where they do not have a network in addition to overlaying a 3g network on top of their existing platform and this will benefit the wireless tower companies finally the third area of growth in the us market comes from new market launches for emerging carriers to get into traditional wireless or technologies like wimax for example leap wireless and metro pcs acquired spectrum in auction 66 in new coverage areas that will require brand new networks clearwire received a billion dollars of investment capital for purposes of building out a nationwide network and is seeking additional capital through an initial public offering based on these factors we believe that the us wireless industry is growing wellcapitalized highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services therefore we expect that we will see a multiyear horizon of strong additional cell site demand from our customers which we believe will translate into strong leasing revenue growth for sba 

company services 

we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices some of which are opened and closed on a projectbyproject basis operationally we are divided into three regions each run by a vice president each region is divided into geographic territories run by local managers within each manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers the majority of our contracts have been for personal communications systems or pcs enhanced specialized mobile radio or esmr and cellular providers of wireless telephony services we also serve wireless data and internet paging pcs narrowband specialized mobile radio multichannel multipoint distribution service and multipoint distribution service wireless providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller local regional or private operators we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

   

during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations personnel have revenue and gross profitbased incentive components in their compensation plans 

in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals 

  

competition 

we compete with 

 

  

  

 there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years specifically american tower corporation completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our acquisition of aat in 2006 and crown castle international completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us which provides them advantages with respect to leasing terms with wireless services providers or ability to acquire available towers wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

our primary competitors for our site leasing activities and building andor acquiring new tower assets are the large independent tower companies american tower corporation and crown castle international corp and a large number of smaller independent tower owners in addition we compete with wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers 

the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including alcoa fujikura ltd bechtel corporation black  veach corporation general dynamics corporation and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project we believe that our experience base and our established relationships with wireless service providers have allowed us to favorably compete for higher margin site development contracts which has resulted in increasing margins in this segment during 2006 as compared to prior years 

employees 

as of december 31 2006 we had 615 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures 

  

these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc standards antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction modification or placement of antenna towers or structures failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would 1 discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or 2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operation of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors 

  

local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2006 we had 179 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 37 million of annual revenue by comparison at december 31 2005 we had 122 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 26 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services was approximately 374 million of contractually committed revenue as of december 31 2006 as compared to approximately 475 million as of december 31 2005 the decrease in 2006 is attributable to a 2003 contract signed with sprint for site development work that is expected to be completed by early 2008 this contract represented approximately 117 million in backlog as of december 31 2006 and approximately 258 million in backlog as of december 31 2005

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks related to our business 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate because many of their existing networks and expansion plans overlap as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers specifically cingular acquired att wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005 to the extent that our customers have consolidated or that other customers may consolidate in the future they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as much space on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness 

as of december 31 2006 cingular and the former att wireless both had leases on an aggregate of 290 of the 5551 towers that we owned on such date the annualized contractual revenue generated by these leases at december 31 2006 was approximately 149 million consequently if cingular were not to renew duplicate leases we could lose 50 or more of such revenue as of december 31 2006 the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 29 years our risk of revenue loss from the integration of cingular and att wireless is not limited to leases on the same tower we expect cingular now att to terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity during the second half of 2006 we began experiencing some decommissioning of antennae sites and nonrenewal of leases from the cingular and att wireless acquisition cingular terminated lease agreements during 2006 with total annualized revenue of 15 million in addition we have received termination or nonrenewal notices for leases expiring in the twentyfour months after december 31 2006 with total annualized revenue of 44 million in addition we have received notifications from cingular that it expects to nonrenew other leases with lease terms expiring in three or more years and we may receive additional notifications in the future such terminations or nonrenewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate 

as of december 31 2006 sprint nextel and affiliated entities had multiple leases on 555 of the 5551 towers that we owned on such date the annualized contractual revenue generated by these leases at december 31 2006 was approximately 271 million during the second half of 2006 sprint nextel extended by seven years the term of each duplicate lease consequently as of december 31 2006 the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 96 years however our risk of revenue loss from the integration of sprint and nextel is not limited to leases on the same tower sprint nextel could terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity furthermore at the end of such lease extensions sprint nextel may terminate the duplicate leases such terminations or nonrenewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate 

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently 

  

enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space in addition the deployment of wifi and wimax technologies could impact the network needs of our existing customers providing wireless telephony services this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers particularly in our site development services business the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

 we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

   

  

  revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five fiveyear periods at the option of the tenant our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity 

 

 as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 16 billion in indebtedness all of which is secured in the cmbs market in addition we have the ability to borrow additional amounts under our senior revolving credit facility and may incur additional indebtedness through other debt instruments our ability to service our current and future debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity restructure or refinance some or all of our debt all of which we have done at various times in the last four years we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms in the future if at all the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders or subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy 

we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the cmbs certificates the amounts borrowed under the mortgage loan in connection with the initial cmbs certificates have an anticipated repayment date of november 2010 and a final repayment date of november 2035 while the amounts borrowed under the mortgage loan in connection with the additional cmbs certificates have an anticipated repayment date of november 2011 and a final repayment date of november 2036 however if we do not repay the full amount of each mortgage loan component before its respective anticipated repayment date the interest rate payable on such mortgage loan outstanding will significantly increase in accordance with the formula set forth in the mortgage loan we may not be able to service these higher interests costs if we cannot refinance the amounts outstanding under the mortgage loan before their anticipated repayment dates furthermore if we cannot refinance these amounts prior to the final repayment date we may be required to sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4975 tower sites that among other things secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan although the mortgage loan is a limited recourse obligation of sba properties inc sba sites inc sba structures inc sba towers inc sba towers puerto rico inc and sba towers usvi inc collectively the “borrowers” and no holder of the mortgage loan will have recourse to sba communications our operations would be adversely affected if the borrowers are unable to repay the components of the mortgage loan we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

we and our subsidiaries may incur significant additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt 

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan 

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

risks associated with our plans to increase our tower portfolio could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition 

we currently intend to increase our tower portfolio through new builds and acquisitions we intend to review all available acquisition opportunities and some of these acquisitions could have the effect of materially increasing our tower portfolio while we intend to fund a portion of the cash required to implement this plan from our cash flow from operating activities we may finance some or all of the costs associated with these new builds and acquisitions furthermore if we were to consummate any significant acquisition we would be required to finance these acquisitions through additional indebtedness which would increase our indebtedness and interest expense and could increase our leverage ratio andor issuances of equity which could be dilutive to our shareholders if we were unable to recognize the expected returns from these new towers or if we did not recognize the expected returns in our anticipated time frames an increase in debt levels without a proportionate increase in our revenues could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we are dependent on the financial strength and creditworthiness of our customers 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants the economic slowdown and intense competition in the wireless and telecommunications industries in 2001 through 2003 had impaired the financial condition of some of our customers certain of which operate with substantial leverage as a result a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers although these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business revenues andor the collectability of our accounts receivable in the future the financial uncertainties facing our customers could reduce demand for our communications sites increase our bad debt expense and reduce prices on new customer contracts this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations 

in addition our anticipated growth could be negatively impacted if our customers’ access to debt and equity capital were limited from 2001 through 2003 when capital market conditions were difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers conserved capital by not spending as much as originally anticipated to finance expansion activities this decrease adversely impacted demand for our services and consequently our financial condition if our customers are not able to access the capital markets in the future our growth strategy revenues and financial condition may again be adversely affected 

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business 

our senior revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if our subsidiaries fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under our senior revolving credit facility additionally under our senior revolving credit facility sba senior finance ii llc “senior finance ii” which owns directly or indirectly all of the common stock and membership interests of certain of our operating subsidiaries and is the borrower under our senior revolving credit facility is required to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding senior finance ii’s debt to annualized operating cash flow cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter in addition the senior revolving credit facility contains additional negative covenants that among other things limit our ability to commit to capital expenditures and build or acquire towers without anchor or acceptable tenants our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to do so 

  

a breach of any of these covenants if not remedied within the specified period could result in an event of default amounts borrowed under the senior revolving credit facility are secured by a lien on substantially all of senior finance ii’s assets and are guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries 

upon the occurrence of any default our senior revolving credit facility lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior revolving credit facility in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events the lenders under our senior revolving credit facility by a majority vote can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under such facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior revolving credit facility such lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 

our mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates contains a covenant requiring that all of the borrowers’ cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments fund required reserves pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and make other payments required under the loan documents be deposited into a reserve account if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 130 times as of the end of any calendar quarter the mortgage loan defines debt service coverage ratio as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan if the debt service coverage ratio is less than 130 times then the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers until the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters as significantly all of our cash flow is generated by the borrowers failure to maintain the debt service coverage ratio above 130 times would impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

the mortgage loan provides for customary remedies if an event of default occurs including foreclosure against all or part of the property pledged as security for the mortgage loan the mortgage loan is secured by 1 mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the borrowers’ tower sites and their operating cash flows 2 a security interest in substantially all of the borrowers’ personal property and fixtures and 3 the borrowers’ rights under the management agreement they entered into with sba network management inc “sba network management” relating to the management of the borrowers’ tower sites by sba network management pursuant to which sba network management arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on the borrowers’ behalf we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis with regard to such fluctuations 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

   

  

 although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely basis to respond to the fluctuations in demand for our site development services 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to significant interest expense depreciation amortization and accretion expenses and losses from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt in the periods presented above for the year ended december 31 2006 we had interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees of 997 million depreciation amortization and accretion expense of 1331 million and losses from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of 572 million in connection with the extinguishment of our outstanding 9 3  4  senior discount notes our outstanding 8 1  2  senior notes and our 11 billion bridge loan for the year ended december 31 2005 we had interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees of 696 million depreciation amortization and accretion expense of 872 million and losses from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of 293 million in connection with the extinguishment of a portion of our outstanding 9 3  4  senior discount notes a portion of our outstanding 8 1  2  senior notes our remaining outstanding 10 1  4  senior notes and our prior credit facility for the year ended december 31 2004 we had interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees of 790 million depreciation amortization and accretion expense of 905 million and losses from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of 412 million in connection with the retirement of our outstanding 12 senior discount notes a portion of our 10 1  4  senior notes and the termination of another prior credit facility we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive competitive pressures for tenants from our competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues margins and financial condition increasing competition could also make the acquisition of quality tower assets more costly which could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement andor maintain our tower acquisition program 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

 there has been significant consolidation among the large independent tower companies in the past three years specifically american tower corporation completed its merger with spectrasite inc in 2005 we completed our acquisition of aat in 2006 and 

  

crown castle international completed its merger with global signal inc in 2007 as a result of these consolidations american tower and crown castle are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than us this could provide them with advantages with respect to establishing favorable leasing terms with wireless service providers or in their ability to acquire available towers 

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks are also generally substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

the site development services segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment have decreased over the past few years many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to build andor acquire as many towers as we anticipate 

we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2007 and to consummate a number of tower acquisitions however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits 

our ability to consummate tower acquisitions is also subject to risks specifically these risks include 1 sufficient cash flow from operations or our ability to use debt or equity to fund such acquisitions 2 our ability to identify those towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results and 3 our ability to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers 

due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2007 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer thomas p hunt our senior vice president and general counsel and anthony j macaione our senior vice president and chief financial officer we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies as well as lower consumer demand and slower consumer adoption rates than anticipated may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g 4g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries the announcement of 4g is relatively new and its deployment schedule has not been determined as of yet additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

  

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines relating to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the federal communications commission the “fcc” the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the federal aviation administration “faa” and fcc regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa and fcc regulations and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrades thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to loss limits and deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock and membership interests of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations is dependent upon dividends and other distributions from our subsidiaries to us additionally the borrowers under the cmbs transaction must repay the components of the mortgage loan thereto if the borrowers’ cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 4975 tower sites that among other things secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan other than the amounts required to make repayment of amounts under the cmbs transaction we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to repay the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs transaction other than the borrowers and sba cmbs1 guarantor llc and cmbs1 holdings llc as guarantors or make any funds available to us for payment the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us may be restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of the senior revolving credit facility and the cmbs certificates 

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders we adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

our issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may trigger a future ownership change which may negatively impact our ability to utilize net operating loss deferred tax assets in the future 

the issuance of equity securities and other associated transactions may increase the chance that we will have a future ownership change under section 382 of the internal revenue code of 1986 we may also have a future ownership change outside of our control caused by future equity transactions by our current shareholders depending on our market value at the time of such future ownership change an ownership change under section 382 could negatively impact our ability to utilize our net operating loss deferred tax assets in the event we generate future taxable income currently we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net operating loss deferred tax asset because we have concluded that our loss history indicates that it is not “more likely than not” that such deferred tax assets will be realized 

  

the market price of our class a common stock could be affected by significant volatility 

the market price of our class a common stock has historically experienced significant fluctuations the market price of our class a common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors including the other factors discussed elsewhere in “risk factors” and in “forwardlooking statements” volatility or depressed market prices of our class a common stock could make it difficult for shareholders to resell their shares of class a common stock when they want or at attractive prices

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1a risk factors of this form 10k our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “forwardlooking statements” and item 1a risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in 47 of the 48 contiguous united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands our principal business line is our site leasing business which contributes over 90 of our segment operating profit in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2006 we owned 5551 towers we also manage or lease over 5700 actual or potential communications sites of which 785 are revenue producing our second business line is our site development business through which we assist wireless service providers in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including alltel cingular now att sprint nextel tmobile and verizon wireless wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site each tenant lease is generally for an initial term of five years and is renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant almost all of our tenant leases contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue additional site leasing revenue is generated through the execution of 1 new lease agreements for new tenant installations and 2 amendments to leases for additional equipment being added by existing tenants of the total annualized revenue added through leases and amendments executed during 2006 73 resulted from new tenant leases the remaining 27 resulted from amendments for additional equipment by comparison for leases and amendments executed during 2005 82 of the total annualized revenue resulted from new tenant leases while 18 resulted from amendments for additional equipment 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing lastly ground leases are generally for an initial term of 5 years or more renewable at our option for multiple fiveyear periods and provide for either annual rent escalators which typically average 3  4 annually or for term escalations of approximately 15 

the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and operating profit contributed by the site leasing segment information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site leasing services business is included in note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

  

 as a result of the aat acquisition we expect that site leasing revenues and segment operating profit will increase substantially in 2007 we believe that over the longterm site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue 

site development services 

our site development business is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to 1 keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and 2 capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development services business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of this project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 

our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 

  

the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues and total segment operating profit contributed by site development services over the last three years information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site development services businesses is included in note 22 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

 during 2004 we completed our previously announced plan to exit the services business in the western portion of the united states based on our determination that the business was no longer beneficial to our site leasing business at the time in connection with this plan we realized gross proceeds from sales during the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 of 04 million and recorded a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of 08 million both of which are included in loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

additional cmbs certificates issuance 

on november 6 2006 sba cmbs 1 depositor llc the “depositor” an indirect subsidiary of ours sold in a private transaction 115 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20061 issued by sba cmbs trust the “trust” a trust established by the depositor the “additional cmbs transaction” the additional cmbs certificates have a weighted average monthly fixed coupon interest rate of 60 and a weighted average interest rate to us of 63 after giving effect to the settlement of the hedging arrangements we entered into in anticipation of the financing we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds from this issuance to repay the bridge facility fund required reserves and pay fees and expenses associated with the additional cmbs transaction the remainder of the net proceeds were used for working capital the additional cmbs certificates have an anticipated repayment date of five years with a final repayment date in november 2036 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2006 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

  

construction revenue 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites and intangible assets we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers or the intangible asset has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

property tax expense 

we typically receive notifications and invoices in arrears for property taxes associated with the tangible personal property and real property used in our site leasing business as a result we recognize property tax expense which is reflected as a component of site leasing cost of revenue based on our best estimate of anticipated property tax payments related to the current period we consider several factors in establishing this estimate including our historical level of incurred property taxes the location of the property our awareness of jurisdictional property value assessment methods and industry related property tax information if our estimates regarding anticipated property tax expenses are incorrect a future increase or decrease in site leasing cost of revenue may be required 

  

results of operations 

year ended 2006 compared to year ended 2005 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of new tenant installations the amount of lease amendments related to equipment added to our towers revenue generated by the towers that we acquired in the aat acquisition other towers acquired and towers constructed during 2006 the aat acquisition contributed approximately 632 million of the increase in total revenues as of december 31 2006 we had 13602 tenants as compared to 8278 tenants at december 31 2005 additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants lastly we added 2249 towers to our portfolio in 2006 versus only adding 244 towers in 2005 

site development consulting revenues increased as a result of a higher volume of work in 2006 versus 2005 site development construction revenue decreased due to the rolloff of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless carriers and our efforts to focus on capturing the higher margin services work rather than volume 

operating expenses 

 

 site leasing cost of revenues increased primarily as a result of the growth in the number of towers owned by us which was 5551 at december 31 2006 up from 3304 at december 31 2005 the aat acquisition contributed approximately 196 million to the increase in total site leasing cost of revenues site development consulting cost of revenues increased as a result of higher volume of work for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the same period of 2005 site development construction cost of revenue decreased due to the rolloff of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless carriers and our efforts to focus on capturing the higher margin services work rather than volume that focus and changing market conditions for the year ended december 31 2006 resulted in higher margin jobs in 2006 versus 2005 

  

selling general and administrative expense increased 141 million which was due to a 69 million increase in salaries benefits and other backoffice operating expenses resulting primarily from a higher number of employees a significant portion of which is attributable to the aat acquisition selling general and administrative expense was also impacted by 53 million of stock option and employee stock purchase plan expense that we recognized in 2006 in accordance with sfas 123r as compared to 05 million in 2005 the remaining portion of the increase was due to 23 million of bonus transition and integration expenses incurred in connection with the aat acquisition these bonus transition and integration expenses are not expected to recur in future years 

depreciation accretion and amortization expense increased primarily due to expense on assets acquired in the aat acquisition which represented approximately 464 million offset by the decrease in certain towers becoming fully depreciated since december 31 2005 

operating income 

 

 the increase in operating income was primarily due to increases in the segment operating profit see below of the site leasing segment which was primarily due to an increased number of towers acquired in the aat acquisition this increase was further augmented by an increase in segment operating profit of the site development construction segment which was due to the rolloff of certain of our prior construction contracts from the larger wireless carriers which were at lower margins than subsequent work that was at higher margins these increases were offset by an increase in selling general and administrative expense and depreciation accretion and amortization expense for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the year ended december 31 2005 

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit related primarily to additional revenue generated by the increased number of towers acquired in the aat acquisition which contributed 436 million of the increase the remaining increase is primarily due to the revenue from the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites in 2006 versus 2005 which had minimal incremental associated costs 

  

other income expense 

 

 interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 increased 408 million from the year ended december 31 2005 this increase is primarily due to the higher aggregate amount of cashinterest bearing debt outstanding during 2006 which consisted of a 11 billion bridge loan during the second third and a portion of the fourth quarters of 2006 and 405 million of initial cmbs certificates outstanding for all twelve months of 2006 and 115 billion of additional cmbs certificates outstanding for the last two months of 2006 versus an average balance of 5876 million of cash interest bearing debt in 2005 which was primarily comprised of our 8 1  2  senior notes our senior secured credit facility and the initial cmbs certificates 

noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 decreased 194 million from the year ended december 31 2005 the decrease was a result of the redemption and repurchase of 1118 million of 9 3  4  senior discount notes in june and november of 2005 and the repurchase of the remaining aggregate principal amount of 2237 million of these notes in april 2006 

amortization of deferred financing fees for the year ended december 31 2006 increased by 87 million as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 this increase was primarily due to amortization of fees relating to the 11 billion bridge loan the 115 billion of additional cmbs certificates the 4050 million of initial cmbs certificates and the senior revolving credit facility for the year ended december 31 2006 versus the amortization of fees on outstanding 8 1  2  senior notes 9 3  4  senior discount notes and the senior secured credit facility for the year ended december 31 2005 

loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt for the year ended december 31 2006 was 572 million an increase of 279 million from the year ended december 31 2005 the increase was attributable to the loss from writeoff of 102 million of deferred financing fees and 470 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the repayment of the 11 billion of the bridge loan in november 2006 repurchase of 2237 million of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and 1625 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes in april 2006 versus the loss from writeoff of 23 million of deferred financing fees and 109 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt associated with the redemption of 1118 million of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes the writeoff of 17 million of deferred financing fees and 74 million of losses from the writeoff of 875 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes the writeoff of 54 million of deferred financing fees associated with the repayment and refinancing of our prior senior credit facility and the writeoff of 08 million of deferred financing fees and 07 million on the extinguishment of debt associated with the redemption of 500 million of our 10 1  4  senior notes during 2005 

  

adjusted ebitda 

 

 the increase in adjusted ebitda for the year ended december 31 2006 was primarily the result of increased segment operating profit from our site leasing segment adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure we reconcile this measure and provide other regulation g disclosures later in this annual report in the section titled nongaap financial measures 

net loss 

 

 net loss for year ended december 31 2006 increased 387 million from the year ended december 31 2005 the increase in net loss is primarily a result of higher interest expense an increase in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt and higher amortization of deferred financing fees offset by improved operating income and lower noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2006 as compared to the year ended december 31 2005 

year ended 2005 compared to year ended 2004 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of new tenant installations the amount of lease amendments related to equipment added to our towers and the towers we acquired and constructed during 2005 as of december 31 2005 we had 8278 tenants as compared to 7449 tenants at december 31 2004 additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants lastly we added 244 towers in 2005 versus only 15 towers in 2004 

site development construction revenue increased primarily as a result of revenue generated from a services contract with cingular in the north and south carolina markets that was only in its initial stages in 2004 the increase in site development construction revenue is also a result of an increase in the overall volume of work in the second third and fourth quarters of 2005 as compared to the same periods of 2004 

  

operating expenses 

 

 site development construction cost of revenue increased primarily as a result of the increase in volume related to the cingular contract mentioned above as well as an increase in the overall volume of work in the second third and fourth quarters of 2005 as compared to the same periods of 2004 

asset impairment charges decreased as a result of impairment charges taken on one tower for 02 million and the remaining value of the microwave network equipment of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as opposed to charges on 40 towers of 26 million and microwave network equipment of 45 million for the year ended december 31 2004 

operating income loss 

 

 the decrease in operating loss from continuing operations primarily was a result of higher revenues and lower overall operating expenses in particular asset impairment charges and a decrease in depreciation accretion and amortization expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit was related primarily to additional revenue per tower generated by the increased number of tenants on our sites in 2005 versus 2004 without a commensurate increase in the cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization due to property tax reductions and tower operating cost reduction initiatives 

  

other income expense 

 

 interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees decreased primarily as a result of the redemptions of 35 of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and our 8 1  2  senior notes from the proceeds of our may and october equity offerings totaling 2269 million in 2005 

the decrease in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was attributed to the writeoff of 102 million of deferred financing fees and 191 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the retirement of our 10 1  4  senior notes refinancing our senior credit facility and redemptions of 35 of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and our 8 1  2  senior notes for the year ended december 31 2005 versus a writeoff of 131 million of deferred financing fees and 281 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt associated with the early retirement of our 12 senior discount notes a significant portion of our 10 1  4  senior notes and the termination of a prior senior credit facility in the year ended december 31 2004 

adjusted ebitda 

 

 the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily the result of improvement in the site leasing segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2005 versus the year ended december 31 2004 adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial measure we reconcile this measure and provide other regulation g disclosures later in this annual report in the section titled nongaap financial measures 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

 

 loss from discontinued operations of 33 million in 2004 was primarily a result of the loss on the western services business which was sold in 2004 as compared to only trailing costs of 006 million in 2005 

  

net loss 

 

 the decrease in net loss is primarily a result of improved operating income loss lower asset impairment charges lower depreciation accretion and amortization expense and lower interest expense and noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared with the year ended december 31 2004 

liquidity and capital resources 

sba communications corporation “sba communications” is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications inc “telecommunications” which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of sba senior finance inc “sba senior finance” which directly or indirectly owns the equity interest in substantially all of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through our sba senior finance subsidiaries primarily through the borrowers under the mortgage loan underlying the initial cmbs certificates and additional cmbs certificates collectively the “cmbs certificates” and sba senior finance ii llc the borrower under the revolving credit facility 

accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our cmbs certificates and our other debt instruments 

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

 

 sources of liquidity 

we have traditionally funded our growth including our tower portfolio growth through borrowings under our revolving credit facility longterm indebtedness and equity issuances in addition we have recently begun to fund our growth with cash flows from operations 

during the past few years we have pursued a strategy of refinancing our higher cost longterm debt with lower cost debt and equity in order to lower our total indebtedness our interest expense and our weighted average cost of debt as a result of these initiatives we redeemed andor repurchased an aggregate of 2493 million of our highyield notes during 2005 and the remaining 3862 million in 2006 in addition we reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 735 at december 31 2005 to 596 at december 31 2006 

  

in connection with the aat acquisition we repurchased all of our outstanding 9 3  4    senior discount notes and 8 1  2  senior notes we funded these repurchases including the associated premiums and fees and the cash consideration paid in the aat acquisition with a portion of 11 billion bridge loan entered into by senior finance 

on november 6 2006 sba cmbs1 depositor llc an indirect subsidiary of ours sold in a private transaction 115 billion of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20061 issued by sba cmbs trust the additional cmbs certificates have a weighted average fixed coupon interest rate of 60 and a weighted average interest rate to us of 63 after giving effect to the settlement of the hedging arrangements we entered into in anticipation of the financing the additional cmbs certificates have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in 2036 we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds received from this offering to repay our 11 billion bridge facility to fund required reserves and pay fees and expenses associated with the additional cmbs transaction the remainder of the net proceeds were used for working capital upon the closing of the additional cmbs transaction we had total indebtedness outstanding of 16 billion consisting entirely of a mortgage loan held by the trust bearing a weighted average coupon fixed interest rate of 59 

on december 22 2005 we entered into a credit agreement for a senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of 1600 million this facility consists of a 1600 million revolving loan which may be borrowed repaid and redrawn subject to compliance with certain covenants this facility will mature on december 21 2007 amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from 75 basis points to 200 basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from 125 basis points to 100 basis points amounts borrowed under this facility will be secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance ii’s assets and are guaranteed by certain of our other subsidiaries no amounts were outstanding under this facility at december 31 2006 as of december 31 2006 we were in full compliance with the terms of the credit facility and based on our current leverage we had the ability to draw an additional 290 million 

cash provided by operating activities was 760 million for the year ended december 31 2006 this amount was primarily the result of operating income from the site leasing segment exclusive of depreciation accretion and amortization 

in order to manage our leverage position and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may decide to pursue a variety of actions these actions may include incurring additional indebtedness to stay at target leverage levels selling certain assets or lines of business issuing common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or pursuing other financial alternatives including securitization transactions if implemented these actions could increase one interest expense andor dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that we will implement any of these strategies or that if implemented these strategies could be implemented on terms favorable to our company and its shareholders 

registration statements 

in connection with our acquisitions we have on file with the securities and exchange commission shelf registration statements on form s4 registering shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services during 2006 the company filed a shelf registration statement on form s4 with the securities and exchange commission registering an aggregate 40 million shares of its class a common stock during 2006 we issued approximately 18 million shares of class a common stock under these registration statements in connection with the acquisition of 131 towers and related assets as of december 31 2006 we had approximately 45 million shares of class a common stock remaining under these shelf registration statements

uses of liquidity 

our principal use of liquidity is cash capital expenditures associated with the growth of our tower portfolio our cash capital expenditures including cash used for acquisitions for the year ended december 31 2006 were 7545 million comprised of 6444 million of cash capital expenditures associated with the aat acquisition and 1101 million of other cash capital expenditures the 1101 million included 163 million related to new tower construction 41 million for maintenance tower capital expenditures 57 million for augmentations and tower upgrades 29 million for general corporate expenditures and 58 million for ground lease purchases this amount also includes cash capital expenditures of 753 million that we incurred in connection with the acquisition of 339 completed towers two towers in process related prorated rental receipts and payments and earnouts for the year ended december 31 2006 the 163 million of new tower construction included costs associated with the completion of 60 new towers during 2006 and costs incurred on sites currently in process 

we currently expect to incur cash capital expenditures associated with tower maintenance and general corporate expenditures of 80 million to 100 million during 2007 based upon our current plans we expect our discretionary cash capital expenditures during 2007 to be at least 750 million to 800 million primarily these cash capital expenditures would relate to the 80 to 100 new towers we intend to build in 2007 ground lease purchases and current acquisitions plans including as of february 22 2007 the 16 towers acquired since december 31 2006 and the 148 towers that are subject to pending acquisition agreements however we are continually and actively looking for additional acquisition opportunities which if consummated would result in additional capital expenditures we expect to fund our discretionary cash capital expenditures from cash on hand cash flow from operations availability under our senior credit facility andor through the issuances of our class a common stock in connection with tower acquisitions 

we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio our new tower build and tower acquisition program and our ground lease purchase program

cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that the borrowers will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as excess cash flow will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to the borrowers the funds in the reserve account will not be released to the borrowers unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan otherwise on a monthly basis the excess cash flow of the borrowers held by the trustee is distributed to the borrowers

 nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconciliation of such nongaap measures to their most directly comparable gaap measures an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations plus net interest expense provision for taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment and other charges noncash compensation and other expenses and excluding noncash leasing revenue noncash ground lease expense and other income we have included this nongaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results in addition adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with some of our debt instruments particularly our senior credit facility adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurement of adjusted ebitda has certain material limitations including 

 

  

  

  

  

   

we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results 

the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda is as follows 

 

 segment operating profit 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments segment operating profit is in our opinion an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization which is largely fixed segment operating profit is not intended to be an alternative measure of revenue or gross profit as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations specifically this measurement does not include depreciation accretion and amortization expense as we use capital assets in our business depreciation accretion and amortization expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate profit therefore any measure that excludes depreciation accretion and amortization expense has material limitations we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of the cash generation of our segment operations

 item 1 business tableend general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers we currently operate in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our towers are located our principal business line is our site leasing business in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2005 we owned 3304 towers in continuing operations our second business line is our site development business through which we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts we lease antenna space on the towers we have constructed the towers we have acquired and the towers we lease sublease andor manage for third parties our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless service provider tenants including alltel cingular sprint nextel tmobile and verizon wireless we believe our current tower portfolio positions us to take advantage of wireless service providers’ antenna and equipment deployment 

as of december 31 2005 we owned 3304 towers up from 3060 as of december 31 2004 we currently believe that tower portfolio growth is the best use of our capital resources to provide our shareholders longterm value consequently we are currently pursuing a limited new build program and tower acquisition program pursuant to these new initiatives we built 36 towers and acquired 208 towers during 2005 the towers under our new build program will be constructed either 1 under buildtosuit arrangements or 2 in locations chosen by us under our buildtosuit arrangements we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower in addition we intend on building towers on locations chosen by us based on our knowledge of our customers’ needs we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts our intent is that substantially all of our new builds will have at least one signed tenant lease on the day that it is completed and we expect that some will have multiple tenants we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2006 with respect to acquisitions we intend to pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential returns and the impact of such acquisition on our leverage ratios for each acquisition we prepare various analyses that include 1 projections of a fiveyear internal rate of return 2 review of available capacity for future lease up projections and 3 summary of current and future tenanttechnology mix 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past five years 

 

  

 as of december 31 2005 we had 8278 tenants on these 3304 towers or an average of 25 tenants per tower our lease contracts typically have terms of five years or more with multiple term tenant renewal options and provide for annual rent escalators 

our site leasing business generates substantially all of our segment operating profit as indicated in the chart below our site leasing business generates 62 of our total revenue and represents 95 of our segment operating profit as defined below 

 

 we believe that over the long term our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and network coverage requirements we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers to be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring wireless service providers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications furthermore because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue 

at december 31 2005 our same tower revenue growth defined as revenue growth for the most recent quarter compared to the comparable quarter in the prior year on towers owned at december 31 2004 that we still owned at december 31 2005 was 12 and our same tower site leasing segment operating profit growth was 18 on the 3060 towers we owned as of december 31 2004 and december 31 2005 

site development services 

our site development business is a corollary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to 1 keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue 

  

and 2 capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following range of services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance personnel in our site development business also support our leasing and new tower build functions through an integrated plan across the divisions 

during 2004 we completed our previously announced plan to exit the services business in the western portion of the united states based on our determination that this business was no longer beneficial to our site leasing business as we had sold our tower portfolio in this region consequently our services business is focused in the northeast and southeast regions of the us in these regions we are involved in major projects with most of the major wireless communications and services companies our site development customers include bechtel corporation cingular general dynamics sprint nextel tmobile and verizon wireless 

for financial information about our operating segments please see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this form 10k 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

focusing on site leasing business with stable recurring revenues we intend to continue to focus on and allocate substantially all of our capital resources to expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more reactive to changes in industry conditions by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

disciplined growth of tower portfolio  we currently believe that the best use of our available capital resources is to use these funds to increase our tower portfolio we intend to use our cash flow from operating activities and available liquidity including borrowings to build andor acquire new towers at prices that we believe will be accretive to our shareholders both short and longterm and which allow us to maintain our target leverage ratios longterm we intend to review all acquisition opportunities both large and small which meet our minimum target levels 

controlling expense base  over the last two years we have successfully restructured our balance sheet to significantly reduce the interest expense associated with our indebtedness we accomplished this by means of our equity offerings redemption of 35 of the 9 3  4  senior discount notes and the 8 1  2  senior notes and the issuance of 4050 million of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates “cmbs certificates” our first securitization transaction which we refer to as the “cmbs transaction” we intend to continue to explore opportunities including those that may be available in the assetbacked securitization market to reduce our interest expense furthermore we have and intend to continue to purchase if available at commercially 

  

reasonable prices the land that underlies our towers as we believe that these purchases will increase our margins and minimize our exposure to increases in ground lease rents in the future due to the relatively young age of our towers we believe that the maintenance and augmentation capital expenditures should be limited for the foreseeable future 

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is best done locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

company services 

we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices some of which are opened and closed on a projectbyproject basis operationally we are divided into two regions in the eastern portion of the united states run by vice presidents each region is divided into geographic territories run by local managers within each manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for all of the large wireless service providers the majority of our contracts have been for personal communications systems or pcs enhanced specialized mobile radio or esmr and cellular providers of wireless telephony services we also serve wireless data and internet paging pcs narrowband specialized mobile radio multichannel multipoint distribution service or mmds and multipoint distribution service or mds wireless providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller local regional or private operators we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

 

   

during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are to 

 

  

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations personnel have revenue and gross profitbased incentive components in their compensation plans 

in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals 

competition 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

   

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

our primary competitors for our site leasing activities and building andor acquiring new tower assets are the large independent tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international corp global signal inc aat communications corp and global tower partners and a large number of smaller independent tower owners in addition we compete with wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers 

the site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including alcoa fujikura ltd bechtel corporation black  veach corporation general dynamics corporation lcc international inc and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and wireless service providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project while we believe that our experience base and our established relationships with wireless service providers causes us to be viewed favorably our margins in this segment have significantly decreased in the last few years due to competition and a decrease in the demand for site development services 

employees 

as of december 31 2005 we had approximately 515 employees none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc standards antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure 

  

registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would 1 discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or 2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operation of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

  

backlog 

backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been signed but have not yet commenced as of december 31 2005 we had 122 new leases which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 26 million of annual revenue by comparison at december 31 2004 we had 113 new leases and 4 amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 25 million of annual revenue 

our backlog for site development services was approximately 48 million of contractually committed revenue as of december 31 2005 as compared to approximately 62 million as of december 31 2004 the decrease in 2005 is attributable to a 2003 contract signed with sprint for site development work that is expected to be completed by mid 2007 this contract represented approximately 26 million in backlog as of december 31 2005 and approximately 46 million in backlog as of december 31 2004

 item 1a risk factors tableend risks related to our business 

we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity 

 

  

 our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity or repurchase restructure or refinance some or all of our debt all of which we have done at various times in the last two years we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms in the future if at all the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders or subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy 

we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay our 9 3  4  senior discount notes or our 8 1  2  senior notes upon their respective maturities therefore prior to the maturity of our outstanding 

  

notes we may be required to refinance andor restructure some or all of this debt we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or restructure this debt on acceptable terms or at all and in particular we cannot assure you that interest rates will be favorable to us at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring if we were unable to refinance restructure or otherwise repay the principal amount of this debt upon its maturity we may need to sell assets cease operations andor file for protection under the bankruptcy laws 

we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the components of the mortgage loan that comprises part of the cmbs transaction therefore prior to the final repayment date for the components of the mortgage loan we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 1714 tower sites that among other things secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan although the mortgage loan is a limited recourse obligation of sba properties inc and no holder of the mortgage loan will have recourse to sba communications our operations would be adversely affected if sba properties is unable to repay the components of the mortgage loan we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

as of december 31 2005 we had no borrowings under our 1600 million senior credit facility of which 391 million was available giving effect to leverage limitations contained in the indenture governing the 9 3  4  senior discount notes subject to maintenance covenants borrowing base limitations and other conditions furthermore we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt 

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates for new tenant leases may decline 

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates for new tenant leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers 

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate because many of their existing networks and expansion plans overlap as a result of regulatory changes in january 2003 which removed prior restrictions on wireless service providers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area there have been significant consolidations of the large wireless service providers specifically cingular acquired att wireless in october 2004 and sprint pcs and nextel merged to form sprint nextel corporation in august 2005 to the extent that our customers have consolidated or that other customers may consolidate in the future they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as much space on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

as of december 31 2005 cingular and the former att wireless both had leases on 274 of our 3304 towers the contractual revenue generated by these leases on these towers at december 31 2005 was approximately 136 million consequently if cingular were not to renew duplicate leases we could lose 50 or more of such revenue as of december 31 2005 the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 29 years our risk of revenue loss from the integration of cingular and att is not limited to leases on the same tower we expect cingular to terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity such terminations or nonrenewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate 

as of december 31 2005 sprint nextel and affiliated entities had multiple leases on 421 of our 3304 towers the contractual revenue generated by these leases on these towers at december 31 2005 was approximately 197 million consequently if sprint nextel were not to renew duplicate leases we could lose 50 or more of such revenue as of december 31 2005 the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 35 years our risk of revenue loss from the integration of sprint nextel merger is not limited to leases on the same tower we expect sprint nextel to terminate or not renew some leases on our towers where they have other antenna sites in close proximity such terminations or nonrenewals could have a material adverse impact on our growth rate 

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers particularly in our site development services business the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

 

   

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

 

  

 revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five fiveyear periods at the option of the tenant our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan 

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan for example it could 

 

  

  

  

  

   

  

 risks associated with our plans to increase our tower portfolio could negatively impact our results of operations or our financial condition 

we currently intend to increase our tower portfolio through new builds and acquisitions we intend to review all available acquisition opportunities including some that are currently available and some of these acquisitions could have the effect of materially increasing our tower portfolio while we intend to fund a portion of the cash required to implement this plan from our cash flow from operating activities we may finance some or all of the costs associated with these new builds and acquisitions furthermore if we were to consummate any significant acquisition we would be required to finance these acquisitions through additional indebtedness which would increase our indebtedness and interest expense and could increase our leverage ratio andor issuances of equity which could be dilutive to our shareholders if we were unable to recognize the expected returns from these new towers or if we did not recognize the expected returns in our anticipated time frames the increase in debt levels without a proportionate increase in our revenues could negatively impact our results of operations and our financial condition 

due to the longterm expectation of revenue from our tenant leases we are dependent on the financial strength and creditworthiness of our customers 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants the economic slowdown and intense competition in the wireless and telecommunications industries in 2001 through 2003 had impaired the financial condition of some of our customers certain of which operate with substantial leverage as a result a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers although these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business revenues andor the collectability of our accounts receivable in the future the financial uncertainties facing our customers could reduce demand for our communications sites increase our bad debt expense and reduce prices on new customer contracts this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations 

in addition our anticipated growth could be negatively impacted if our customers’ access to debt and equity capital were limited from 2001 through 2003 when capital market conditions were difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers conserved capital by not spending as much as originally anticipated to finance expansion activities this decrease adversely impacted demand for our services and consequently our financial condition if our customers are not able to access the capital markets in the future our growth strategy revenues and financial condition may again be adversely affected 

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes each contain certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants limit our ability to 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

 if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments the acceleration of amounts due under one of our debt instruments would also cause a crossdefault under our other debt instruments 

sba senior finance ii llc “senior finance ii” which owns directly or indirectly all of the common stock and membership interests of the majority of our operating subsidiaries is the borrower under our senior credit facility the senior credit facility requires senior finance ii to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding senior finance ii’s debt to annualized operating cash flow cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter in addition the senior credit facility contains additional negative covenants that among other things limit our ability to commit to capital expenditures and build or acquire towers without anchor or acceptable tenants our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to do so a breach of any of these covenants if not remedied within the specified period could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 

  

upon the occurrence of any default our senior credit facility lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events senior credit facility lenders by a majority vote can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a crossdefault under our indentures thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility andor indebtedness under our outstanding notes were to be accelerated our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility the senior credit facility lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness amounts borrowed under the senior credit facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of senior finance ii’s assets and are guaranteed by sba communications and certain of its subsidiaries in such an event of default our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes 

our 4050 million mortgage loan relating to our cmbs certificates contains a covenant requiring all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents be deposited into a reserve account if the debt service coverage ratio falls to 130 times or lower as of the end of any calendar quarter debt service coverage ratio is defined as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that sba properties inc will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan the funds in the reserve account will not be released to sba properties unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters failure to maintain the debt service coverage ratio above 130 times would impact our ability to pay our indebtedness other than the mortgage loan and to operate our business 

the mortgage loan provides for customary remedies if an event of default occurs including foreclosure against all or part of the property pledged as security for the mortgage loan the mortgage loan is secured by 1 mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 1714 collateralized tower sites and their operating cash flows 2 a security interest in substantially all of sba properties’ personal property and fixtures and 3 sba properties’ rights under the management agreement with sba network management inc who manages all of sba properties’ sites we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay this indebtedness in full 

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our longterm results 

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

   

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely basis to accommodate market slowdowns 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 

 our losses are principally due to significant interest expense and depreciation and amortization in each of the periods presented above for the year ended december 31 2005 we recorded asset impairment charges of 04 million and a charge associated with the writeoff of deferred financing fees and loss on the extinguishment of debt of 293 million for the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded an asset impairment charge of 71 million and a charge associated with the writeoff of deferred financing fees and loss on the extinguishment of debt of 412 million we recorded an asset impairment charge of 130 million a charge associated with the loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of 242 million and a restructuring charge of 21 million during the year ended december 31 2003 we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us 

our industry is highly competitive competitive pressures for tenants from our competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues margins and financial condition increasing competition could also make the acquisition of quality tower assets more costly which could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement andor maintain our tower acquisition program 

in the site leasing business we compete with 

 

  

  

 wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

the site development services segment of our industry is also extremely competitive there are numerous large and small companies that offer one or more of the services offered by our site development business as a result of this competition margins in this segment have decreased over the past few years many of our competitors have lower overhead expenses and therefore may be able to provide services at prices that we 

  

consider unprofitable if margins in this segment were to further decrease our consolidated revenues and our site development segment operating profit could be adversely affected 

we may not be able to build andor acquire as many towers as we anticipate 

we currently intend to build 80 to 100 new towers during 2006 and to consummate a number of tower acquisitions however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits 

our ability to consummate tower acquisitions is also subject to risks specifically these risks include 1 sufficient capital to fund such acquisitions 2 our ability to identify those towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our financial results and 3 our ability to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2006 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to achieve our financial goals 

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer and thomas p hunt our senior vice president and general counsel we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

new technologies and their use by wireless service providers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the increased use by wireless service providers of signal combining and related technologies and products that allow two or more wireless service providers to provide services on different transmission frequencies using the communications antenna and other facilities normally used by only one wireless service provider could reduce the demand for our tower space additionally the use of technologies that enhance spectral capacity such as beam forming or “smart antennae” that can increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of additional sites a wireless service provider needs to adequately serve a certain subscriber base and therefore reduce demand for our tower space the development and growth of communications and other new technologies that do not require groundbased sites such as the growth in delivery of video voice and data services by satellites or other technologies could also adversely affect the demand for our tower space in addition the deployment of wifi and wimax technologies could impact the network needs of our existing customers providing wireless telephony services this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

delays or changes in the deployment or adoption of new technologies as well as lower consumer demand and slower consumer adoption rates than anticipated may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate 

there can be no assurances that 3g or other new wireless technologies will be deployed or adopted as rapidly as projected or that these new technologies will be implemented in the manner anticipated the deployment of 3g has already experienced significant delays from the original projected timelines of the wireless and broadcast industries additionally the demand by consumers and the adoption rate of consumers for these new technologies once deployed may be lower or slower than anticipated these factors could have a material 

  

adverse effect on our growth rate since growth opportunities and demand for our tower space as a result of such new technologies may not be realized at the times or to the extent anticipated 

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects 

the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the fcc and faa regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa standards and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or 

  

underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations including the principal and interest premium if any and additional interest if any on our outstanding 9 3  4  senior discount notes and our 8 1  2  senior notes is dependent upon dividends and other distribution from our subsidiaries to us additionally sba properties as the borrower under the cmbs transaction must repay the components of the mortgage loan thereto if sba properties’ cash flow is insufficient to cover such repayments we may be required to refinance the mortgage loan or sell a portion or all of our interests in the 1714 tower sites that among other things secure along with their operating cash flows the mortgage loan other than the amounts required to make interest and principal payments on the notes and repayment of amounts under the cmbs transaction we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay the principal interest and other amounts on the notes or repay the components of the mortgage loan pursuant to the cmbs transaction other than sba properties as the borrower and sba cmbs1 guarantor llc and cmbs1 holdings llc as guarantors or make any funds available to us for payment the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us may be restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of the senior credit facility and the cmbs certificates although the indentures governing the notes will limit the ability of our operating subsidiaries to enter into consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us these limitations are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in item 1b risk factors of this form 10k our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “forwardlooking statements” and item 1b risk factors 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers we currently operate in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our towers are located our principal business line is our site leasing business in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage for or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2005 we owned 3304 towers the substantial majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who like us have built such towers taking into consideration colocation opportunities in addition through our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

revenues derived from the leasing of antenna space at or on communication towers continued to increase as a result of our emphasis on our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites during 2004 we completed our previously announced plan of disposing of our services business in the western twothirds of the united states 

site leasing services 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants including alltel cingular sprint nextel tmobile and verizon wireless revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different tenant leases each tenant lease relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years and is renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant almost all of our tenant leases contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods tenant leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

 

  

  

  

  

  

 for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower the amount of other direct costs associated with operating a tower varies from site to site depending on the taxing jurisdiction and the height and age of the tower but typically do not make up a large percentage of total operating costs the ongoing maintenance requirements are typically minimal and include replacing lighting systems painting a tower or upgrading or repairing an access road or fencing lastly ground leases are generally for an initial term of 5 years or more with multiple renewal options of five year periods at our option and provide for rent escalators which typically average 3  4 annually or provide for term escalations of approximately 15 

  

the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and operating profit contributed by the site leasing segment information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site leasing services business is included in note 21 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

 

 site development services 

our site development business is a corollary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to 1 keep in close contact with the wireless service providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and 2 capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities such as antenna installation and equipment installation at our tower locations our site development services business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services we principally perform services for third parties in our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction 

site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to twelve months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 

our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 

since 2001 our site development services profit levels have decreased significantly as a result of a substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless service providers particularly during 20012003 as well as competitive pricing pressures that have driven margins below our desired levels the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues and total segment operating profit contributed by site development services over the last three years information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site development services businesses is included in note 21 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

  

 we have mitigated the decline in site development services revenues and operating profit levels by focusing on site leasing as our primary business as well as focusing on our core historical areas of wireless expertise specifically site acquisition zoning technical services and construction for our site development services business during 2004 we completed our previously announced plan to exit the services business in the western portion of the united states based on our determination that the business was no longer beneficial to our site leasing business gross proceeds realized from sales during the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 were 04 million and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of 08 million was recorded which is included in loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2005 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

construction revenue 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

asset impairment 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider 

  

many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

results of operations 

year ended 2005 compared to year ended 2004 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of new tenant installations the amount of lease amendments related to equipment added to our towers and the towers we acquired and constructed during 2005 as of december 31 2005 we had 8278 tenants as compared to 7449 tenants at december 31 2004 during the year ended 2005 82 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2005 were related to new tenant installation and 18 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants during the year ended 2004 88 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2004 were related to new tenant installation and 12 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants additionally we have experienced higher average rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants lastly we added 244 towers to our portfolio in 2005 versus only 15 towers in 2004 

site development construction revenue increased primarily as a result of revenue generated from a services contract with cingular in the north and south carolina markets that was only in its initial stages in 2004 the increase in site development construction revenue is also a result of an increase in the overall volume of work in the second third and fourth quarters of 2005 as compared to the same periods of 2004 

  

operating expenses 

 

 site development construction cost of revenue increased primarily as a result of the increase in volume related to the cingular contract mentioned above as well as an increase in the overall volume of work in the second third and fourth quarters of 2005 as compared to the same periods of 2004 

asset impairment charges decreased as a result of impairment charges taken on one tower for 02 million and the remaining value of the microwave network equipment of 02 million for the year ended december 31 2005 as opposed to charges on 40 towers of 26 million and microwave network equipment of 45 million for the year ended december 31 2004 

operating income loss from continuing operations 

 

 the decrease in operating loss from continuing operations primarily was a result of higher revenues and lower overall operating expenses in particular asset impairment charges and a decrease in depreciation accretion and amortization expense in 2005 as compared to 2004 

segment operating profit 

 

 the increase in site leasing segment operating profit was related primarily to additional revenue per tower generated by the increased number of tenants and tenant equipment on our sites in 2005 versus 2004 without a commensurate increase in the cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization due to property tax reductions and tower operating cost reduction initiatives 

  

other income expense 

 

 interest expense noncash interest expense and amortization of deferred financing fees decreased primarily as a result of the redemptions of 35 of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and our 8 1  2  senior notes from the gross proceeds of our may and october equity offerings totaling 2269 million in 2005 

the decrease in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was attributed to the writeoff of 102 million of deferred financing fees and 191 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the retirement of our 10 1  4  senior notes refinancing our senior credit facility and redemptions of 35 of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and our 8 1  2  senior notes for the year ended december 31 2005 versus a writeoff of 131 million of deferred financing fees and 281 million of losses on the extinguishment of debt associated with the early retirement of our 12 senior discount notes a significant portion of our 10 1  4  senior notes and the termination of a prior senior credit facility in the year ended december 31 2004 

adjusted ebitda 

 

 the increase in adjusted ebitda was primarily the result of stronger performance of the site leasing segment operating profit for the year ended december 31 2005 versus the year ended december 31 2004 

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

 

 loss from discontinued operations of 33 million in 2004 was primarily a result of the loss on the western services business which was sold in 2004 as compared to only trailing cost of 006 million recorded in 2005 

  

net loss 

 

 the decrease in net loss is primarily a result of improved operating income loss from continuing operations lower asset impairment charges lower depreciation accretion and amortization expense and lower interest expense and noncash interest expense for the year ended december 31 2005 as compared with the year ended december 31 2004 

year ended 2004 compared to year ended 2003 

revenues 

 

 site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our towers during the year ended 2004 88 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2004 were related to new tenant installation and 12 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants during the year ended 2003 89 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2003 were related to new tenant installation and 11 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants additionally we have experienced higher average rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants 

site development construction revenue increased primarily as a result of the significant services contract awarded by sprint in mid 2003 which increased our volume of activity for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period a year ago 

  

operating expenses 

 

 cost of revenues increased primarily due to increased activity associated with the significant services contract awarded by sprint in mid 2003 related to the site development construction business 

in 2004 we recognized approximately 71 million in asset impairment charges related to 40 towers and a microwave network by comparison in 2003 we recognized approximately 130 million of asset impairment charges related to 70 towers in addition selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the reduction of bad debt expense of approximately 20 million as a result of improved collections and credit quality of our receivables

other income expense 

 

 interest expense decreased in 2004 primarily as a result of the repurchases and redemption of the 12 senior discount notes with proceeds from the 9 3  4  senior discount notes issued in december 2003 and proceeds from our prior senior credit facility which we obtained in january 2004 as well as repurchases of our 10 1  4  senior notes throughout 2004 

non cash interest expense increased due to the amortization of the original interest discount of the 9 3  4  senior discount notes which were issued to refinance the 12 senior discount notes in late 2003 

the increase in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was attributed to a writeoff of 131 million of deferred financing fees and a 281 million loss on the extinguishment of debt associated with the early retirement of our 12 senior discount notes a significant portion of our 10 1  4  senior notes and the termination of the may 2003 senior credit facility in the year ended december 31 2004 versus the writeoff of 44 million of deferred financing fees associated with the refinancing of our senior credit facility loans which were repaid in full and a loss on extinguishment of debt of 198 million relating to the repurchase of our 12 senior discount notes for the comparable period in 2003

liquidity and capital resources 

sba communications corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications inc “telecommunications” which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of sba senior finance sba senior finance owns directly or indirectly the capital stock of our subsidiaries or is the sole member if the subsidiary is a limited liability company “llc” we conduct all of our business operations through our sba senior finance subsidiaries 

accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our cmbs certificates senior credit facility and the indentures for the 9 3  4  senior discount notes and the 8 1  2  senior notes 

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

 

   

sources of liquidity 

we have traditionally funded our growth including our tower portfolio growth through longterm indebtedness during 2003 and 2004 we issued longterm indebtedness to permit us to redeem our older more expensive outstanding notes and reduce our weighted cost of debt in december 2003 sba communications and telecommunications coissued 4020 million of aggregate principal amount at maturity of their 9 3  4  senior discount notes and used the proceeds to redeem andor repurchase all of our 12 senior discount notes and to repurchase a portion of our 10 1  4  senior notes in december 2004 we issued 2500 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes and used the proceeds to redeem andor repurchase all of our outstanding 10 1  4  senior notes of which we repurchased 1865 million in december 2004 and redeemed the remaining 500 million on february 1 2005 

on may 11 2005 we issued 80 million shares of our class a common stock the shares were issued off of the universal shelf registration statement we have on file with the securities and exchange commission “sec” which registers the issuance of any combination of the following securities class a common stock preferred stock debt securities depositary shares or warrants the net proceeds from the issuance were 754 million after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses and were used to redeem an accreted balance of 689 million of the 9 3  4  senior discount notes and to pay the applicable premium for the redemption 

on october 5 2005 we issued 100 million shares of our class a common stock the shares were issued off of the universal shelf registration statement discussed above the net proceeds from the issuance were 1515 million after deducting underwriting fees and offering expenses on november 7 2005 these proceeds were used to redeem an accreted balance of 429 million of the 9 3  4  senior discount notes and pay the applicable premium for the redemption redeem 875 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes and pay the applicable premium for the redemption and for working capital purposes after adjustment for the may 11 2005 and october 5 2005 offerings we can still issue up to 214 million of securities under our universal shelf registration statement 

on november 18 2005 sba cmbs1 depositor llc the “depositor” an indirect subsidiary of sba communications sold in a private transaction 405 million of commercial mortgage passthrough certificates series 20051 the “cmbs certificates” issued by sba cmbs trust the “trust” a trust established by the depositor the cmbs certificates have a contract weighted average fixed interest rate of 56 and an weighted average interest rate to us of 48 after giving effect to the settlement gain of two interest rate swap agreements entered in contemplation of the transaction the cmbs certificates are rated investment grade and have an expected life of five years with a final repayment date in 2035 we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds from this issuance to refinance the prior senior credit facility and fund reserves and expenses associated with the cmbs transaction the remainder of the net proceeds will be used by us at our discretion 

we also have on file with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s4 registering shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states as of december 31 2005 we have approximately 23 million shares of class a common stock remaining under this shelf registration statement 

on december 22 2005 we closed on a new senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of 1600 million the new facility consists of a 1600 million revolving loan which may be borrowed repaid and redrawn subject to compliance with certain covenants the new facility will mature on december 21 2007 amounts borrowed under the facility will accrue interest at libor plus a margin that ranges from 75 basis points to 200 basis points or at a base rate plus a margin that ranges from 125 basis points to 100 basis points amounts borrowed under this facility will be secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance ii’s assets and are guaranteed by certain of our other subsidiaries no amounts were outstanding under this facility at december 31 2005 as of december 31 2005 we were in full compliance with the terms of the new credit facility and had the ability to draw an additional 391 million giving effect to leverage limitations contained in the indenture governing the 9 3  4  senior discount notes 

a main priority for us continues to be reductions in our weighted average cost of debt as part of this initiative we have and may continue to repurchase for cash andor equity our higher cost outstanding indebtedness as a result of our refinancing debt repurchase and redemption activities we have reduced our weighted average cost of debt from 77 at december 31 2004 to 74 at december 31 2005 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 498 million for the year ended december 31 2005 this amount was primarily the result of operating income from the site leasing segment exclusive of depreciation accretion and amortization 

in addition to our capital restructuring activities completed in 2003 2004 and 2005 in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may explore a number of alternatives including selling certain assets or lines of business issuing equity repurchasing restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives including securitization transactions and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives upon closing the cmbs transaction in november 2005 we used a substantial portion of the net proceeds to refinance the entire 4000 million senior credit facility which had a balance outstanding of 3209 million and we intend to explore the possibilities and alternatives for refinancing our remaining high yield debt securities in the future one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of entering into a new credit facility issuing high yield notes entering into a securitization transaction issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting our existing indebtedness into shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock any of which would dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that any of these strategies can be consummated or if consummated would effectively address the risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 

uses of liquidity 

during 2005 cash used by us relating to financing activities included 1 the payment of 525 million relating to the redemption of our outstanding 10 1  4  senior notes which were redeemed from proceeds from the issuance of our 8 1  2  senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2004 2 the payment of 756 million relating to the redemption of 689 million accreted value of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes which were redeemed from the net proceeds of the issuance of 80 million shares of our class a common stock in may 2005 3 the payment of 471 million relating to the redemption of 429 million accreted value of our 9 3  4  senior discount notes and the payment of 949 million relating to the redemption of 875 million of our 8 1  2  senior notes which were redeemed from the net proceeds of the issuance of 100 million shares of our class a common stock in october 2005 and 4 the payment of an aggregate of 3209 million relating to the repayment and refinancing of our prior senior credit facility 

our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2005 were 810 million included in this amount was 122 million related to new tower construction 28 million for maintenance tower capital expenditures 31 million for augmentations and tower upgrades 16 million for general corporate expenditures and 45 million for ground lease purchases in addition we had cash capital expenditures of 568 million and issued approximately 17 million shares of class a common stock in connection with the acquisition of 208 towers related prorated rental receipts and payments and earnouts for the year ended december 31 2005 

the 122 million of new tower construction included costs associated with the completion of 36 new towers during 2005 and costs incurred on sites currently in process as of february 20 2006 we plan to make total cash capital expenditures during 2006 of 255 million to 325 million primarily in connection with our plans to build between 80 and 100 towers and to make cash expenditures of approximately 484 million relating to the acquisition of 164 towers already acquired or under signed purchase agreements as of february 20 2006 all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow from operations availability under our new senior credit facility andor through the issuances of our class a common stock in connection with tower acquisitions 

we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year for capital improvements or modifications to our towers all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and our new tower build program

cmbs certificates 

on november 18 2005 the depositor sold in a private transaction 405 million of cmbs certificates series 20051 issued by the trust the cmbs certificates consist of five classes all of which are rated investment grade as indicated in the table below 

 

 the contract weighted average fixed interest rate of the certificates is 56 and the effective weighted average fixed interest rate to sba properties is 48 after giving effect to a settlement gain of two interest rate swap agreements entered in contemplation of the transaction the cmbs certificates have an 

  

expected life of five years with a final repayment date in 2035 the proceeds of the cmbs certificates were primarily used to purchase the prior senior credit facility of sba senior finance and to fund reserves and pay expenses associated with the offering 

the purpose of the cmbs transaction was to refinance our prior senior credit facility and therefore continue to improve our balance sheet in connection with the cmbs transaction the prior senior credit facility was amended and restated to replace sba properties as the new borrower to completely release sba finance and the other guarantors of any obligations under the senior credit facility to increase the principal amount of the loan to 4050 million and to amend various other terms as amended and restated the “mortgage loan” furthermore the mortgage loan was purchased by the depositor with proceeds from the cmbs transaction the depositor then assigned the mortgage loan to the trust who has all rights as lender under the mortgage loan 

interest on the mortgage loan will be paid from the operating cash flows from sba properties’ 1714 tower sites sba properties is required to make monthly payments of interest on the mortgage loan subject to certain limited exceptions described below no payments of principal will be required to be made prior to the monthly payment date in november 2010 which is the anticipated repayment date however if the debt service coverage ratio defined as the net cash flow as defined in the mortgage loan agreement divided by the amount of interest on the mortgage loan servicing fees and trustee fees that sba properties will be required to pay over the succeeding twelve months as of the end of any calendar quarter falls to 130 times or lower then all cash flow in excess of amounts required to make debt service payments to fund required reserves to pay management fees and budgeted operating expenses and to make other payments required under the loan documents referred to as excess cash flow will be deposited into a reserve account instead of being released to sba properties the funds in the reserve account will not be released to sba properties unless the debt service coverage ratio exceeds 130 times for two consecutive calendar quarters if the debt service coverage ratio falls below 115 times as of the end of any calendar quarter then an “amortization period” will commence and all funds on deposit in the reserve account will be applied to prepay the mortgage loan otherwise on a monthly basis the excess cash flow of sba properties held by the trustee after payment of principal interest reserves and expenses is distributed to sba properties 

sba properties may not prepay the mortgage loan in whole or in part at any time prior to november 2010 except in limited circumstances such as the occurrence of certain casualty and condemnation events relating to sba properties’ tower sites thereafter prepayment is permitted provided it is accompanied by any applicable prepayment consideration if the prepayment occurs within nine months of the final maturity date no prepayment consideration is due the entire unpaid principal balance of the mortgage loan will be due in november 2035 the mortgage loan may be defeased in whole at any time 

the mortgage loan is secured by 1 mortgages deeds of trust and deeds to secure debt on substantially all of the 1714 tower sites and their operating cash flows 2 a security interest in substantially all of sba properties’ personal property and fixtures and 3 sba properties’ rights under the management agreement it entered into with sba network management inc relating to the management of sba properties’ tower sites by sba network pursuant to which sba network arranges for the payment of all operating expenses and the funding of all capital expenditures out of amounts on deposit in one or more operating accounts maintained on sba properties’ behalf for each calendar month sba network is entitled to receive a management fee equal to 10 of sba properties’ operating revenues for the immediately preceding calendar month

recent accounting pronouncements 

stockbased compensation 

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued sfas no 123r “ sharebased payment ” sfas no 123r is a revision of sfas 123 and supersedes apb 25 among other items sfas 123r eliminates the use of apb 25 and the intrinsic value method of accounting and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in the financial statements pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard although early adoption is allowed we will adopt sfas 123r as of the required effective date for calendar year companies which is january 1 2006 

sfas 123r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a “modified prospective” method or a “modified retrospective” method under the “modified prospective” method compensation expense is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas 123r for all sharebased payments granted after that date and based on the requirements of sfas 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas 123r under the “modified retrospective” method the requirements 

  

are the same as under the “modified prospective” method but also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas 123 we have determined that we will use the “modified prospective” method to recognize compensation expense 

we currently utilize the blackscholes option pricing model to measure the fair value of stock options granted to our employees while sfas 123r permits entities to continue to use such a model the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial or “lattice” model based upon our evaluation of the alternative models available to value option grants we have determined that we will continue to use the blackscholes model for option valuation 

other pronouncements 

in may 2005 fasb issued statement no 154 “accounting changes and error correctionsa replacement of apb opinion no 20 and fasb statement no 3” “sfas 154” this standard replaces apb opinion no 20 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 3 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle sfas 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions sfas 154 also requires that a change in depreciation amortization or depletion method for longlived nonfinancial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle sfas 154 requires that the change in accounting principle be applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather than being reported in an income statement such a change would require us to restate its previously issued financial statements to reflect the change in accounting principle to prior periods presented sfas 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december 15 2005 the adoption of sfas 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 

in march 2005 fasb interpretation no 47 “accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 143” “fin 47” was issued fin 47 provides clarification with respect to the timing of liability recognition of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible longlived assets when the timing andor method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event fin 47 is effective no later than the end of fiscal years ending after december 15 2005 december 31 2005 for calendaryear enterprises the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets—an amendment of apb no 29” “sfas 153” the amendments made by sfas 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged further the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have “commercial substance” this standard was effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july 1 2005 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

nongaap financial measures 

this report contains certain nongaap measures including adjusted ebitda and segment operating profit information we have provided below a description of such nongaap measures a reconcilement of such nongaap measures to their most comparable gaap measures an explanation as to why management utilizes these measures their respective limitations and how management compensates for such limitations 

adjusted ebitda 

we define adjusted ebitda as loss from continuing operations plus net interest expenses provision for income taxes depreciation accretion and amortization asset impairment charges noncash compensation restructuring and other charges and other expenses and excluding noncash leasing revenue and noncash ground lease expense we have included this nongaap financial measure because we believe this item is an indicator of the profitability and performance of our core operations and reflects the changes in our operating results in addition adjusted ebitda is a component of the calculation used by our lenders to determine compliance with some of our debt instruments particularly our senior credit facility adjusted ebitda is not intended to be an alternative measure of operating income as determined in accordance with gaap 

the nongaap measurements of adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin have certain material limitations including 

 

  

  

  

 we compensate for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda and the adjusted ebitda margin as only two of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of our profitability and operating results 

  

 segment operating profit 

each respective segment operating profit is defined as segment revenues less segment cost of revenues excluding depreciation accretion and amortization total segment operating profit is the total of the operating profits of the two segments segment operating profit is in our opinion an indicator of the operating performance of our site leasing and site development segments and is used to provide management with the ability to monitor the operating results and margin of each segment while excluding the impact of depreciation and amortization segment operating profit is not intended to be alternative measures of revenue or operating income as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

  

 the nongaap measurement of segment operating profit has certain material limitations specifically this measurement does not include depreciation accretion and amortization expense because depreciation accretion and amortization expense is required by gaap as it is deemed to reflect additional operating expenses relating to our site leasing and site development segments any measure that excludes these items has material limitations we compensate for these limitations by using segment operating profit as only one of several comparative tools together with gaap measurements to assist in the evaluation of the cash generation of our segment operations

 item 1 business 

  

general 

  

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the eastern third of the united states we generate revenues from our two businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired as of december 31 2004 we owned 3060 towers in continuing operations approximately 60 of which we have built ourselves in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks since our founding in 1989 we have participated in the development of more than 25000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major wireless markets in the united states 

  

site leasing services 

  

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts our site leasing business generates substantially all of our gross profit our activities are focused in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our towers are located we believe that over the long term our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of network use and network coverage requirements we lease antenna space on the towers we have constructed the towers we have acquired and the towers we lease sublease andor manage for third parties our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless carrier tenants including alltel cingular nextel sprint pcs tmobile and verizon wireless and we believe our current tower portfolio positions us to take advantage of wireless carriers’ antenna and equipment deployment we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers will be minimal consequently we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring carriers to bear all or a portion of the cost of tower modifications because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue our lease contracts typically have terms of five years or more with multiple term tenant renewal options and provide for annual rent escalators 

  

during 2004 we announced our intention to recommence on a limited basis our new build program the towers under our new build program will be constructed either under buildtosuit arrangements or in locations chosen by us under our buildtosuit arrangements we will build towers for a wireless service provider on a location of their direction we retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower in addition we intend on building towers on locations chosen by us based on our knowledge of our customers’ needs we seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts our intent is that each of our new builds will have at least one tenant on the day that it is completed and we expect that many will have multiple tenants we expect to build a total of 50 to 75 new towers during 2005 

  

the table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower portfolio over the past five years 

  

   

   

as of december 31 2004 we had 7257 tenants on our 3060 towers included in continuing operations 

  

at december 31 2004 our same tower revenue growth defined as year over year growth on towers owned at december 31 2003 that were still owned by the company at december 31 2004 was 14 and our same tower site leasing gross profit growth was 20 on the 3053 towers we owned as of december 31 2003 and december 31 2004 in continuing operations 

  

the following chart includes details regarding our site leasing revenue and gross profit percentage 

  

   

to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in our towers we provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space the services we provide or may provide in the future include generator provisioning antenna installation equipment installation maintenance and backhaul which is the transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by an antenna to a carrier’s network some of these services are part of our site leasing services eg the generator provisioning and are recurring in nature and are contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the way they lease antenna space 

  

site development services 

  

our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance during 2004 we completed our previously announced plan to exit the services business in the western portion of the united states based on our determination that this business was no longer beneficial to our site leasing business consequently our services business is focused in the northeast and southeast regions of the us in these regions we are involved in major projects with most of the major wireless communications and services companies our site development customers include bechtel corporation cingular general dynamics nextel sprint pcs tmobile and verizon wireless 

  

business strategy 

  

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

  

focusing on site leasing business with stable recurring revenues we intend to continue to focus on and allocate substantially all of our capital resources to expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin rent escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more reactive to changes in industry conditions by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

  

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed our towers to accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

  

geographically focusing our tower ownership we have decided to focus our tower ownership geographically in the eastern third of the united states we believe that focusing our site leasing activities in this smaller geographic area where we have a higher concentration of towers will improve our operating efficiencies and reduce our overhead expenses and procure higher revenue per tower 

  

disciplined capital expenditures while reducing our leverage  over the last two years we have successfully reduced our leverage and implemented a disciplined level of capital expenditures while we plan on selectively investing in new tower builds andor tower acquisitions that we believe present good business opportunities we intend that these investments will be consistent with our commitment to proactively manage our level of capital expenditures and reduce our leverage below current levels 

  

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is best done locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

  

capturing other revenues that flow from our tower ownership to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from capital investment in our towers we provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space including antenna installation and equipment installation because of our ownership of the tower our control of the tower site and experience and capabilities in providing installation services we believe that we are well positioned to perform more of these services and capture the related revenue 

  

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

  

company services 

  

we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices some of which are opened and closed on a projectbyproject basis operationally we are divided into two regions in the eastern portion of the united states run by vice presidents each region is divided into geographic territories run by local managers within each manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

  

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office 

  

customers 

  

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for most of the largest wireless service providers the majority of our contracts have been for pcs enhanced specialized mobile radio or esmr and cellular providers of wireless telephony services we also serve wireless data and internet paging pcs narrowband specialized mobile radio multichannel multipoint distribution service or mmds and multipoint distribution service or mds wireless providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller local regional or private operators we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues the following customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues during at least one of the last three years 

  

   

during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

  

   

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing goals are to 

  

   

   

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations personnel have revenue and gross profitbased incentive components in their compensation plans 

  

in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

  

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals 

  

competition 

  

we compete with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  

our primary competitors for our site leasing activities and generating new tower assets are five large independent tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international corp global signal inc spectrasite inc and aat communications corp and a large number of smaller independent tower owners in addition we compete with wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers 

  

we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including american tower corporation alcoa fujikura ltd bechtel corporation black  veach corporation general dynamics corporation lcc international inc and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project we believe that we compete favorably in these areas 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately 475 employees none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

  

regulatory and environmental matters 

  

federal regulations both the federal communications commission the “fcc” and the federal aviation administration the “faa” regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

  

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc standards antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would 1 discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or 2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

  

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the 

  

environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operation of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

  

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

  

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations or certain other entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog of pending leases for antenna space on our towers varies from time to time and reflects the relatively shortcycle of three to six months of the antenna space leasing process leasing backlogs vary widely within a fiscal quarter and are generally lowest on the last day of a quarter as our customers strive to meet their own quarterly antenna site deployment goals backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments which have been executed with customers but have not begun generating revenue as of december 31 2004 we had 113 new leases and 4 amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 25 million of annual revenue as of december 31 2003 we had 116 new leases and 15 amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately 26 million of annual revenue 

  

backlog related to our site development services business consists of work under contracts executed with customers that have not yet commenced and thus have not begun generating revenue our backlog for site development services was approximately 62 million of contractually committed revenue as of december 31 2004 as compared to approximately 80 million as of december 31 2003 the decrease in 2004 is attributable to a 2003 contract signed with sprint for site development work which is expected to be completed by mid 2006 this contract represented approximately 46 million in backlog as of december 31 2004 and approximately 60 million in backlog as of december 31 2003 

  

backlog related to our tower acquisition efforts consists of pending acquisitions under signed purchase agreements which have not yet closed our backlog for pending tower acquisitions as of december 31 2004 was approximately 81 million we did not have any pending acquisitions as of december 31 2003 

  

risks related to our business 

  

we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness 

  

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity 

  

    

our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance our earnings were insufficient to cover our fixed charges for the year ended december 31 2004 by  1433 million and 1731 million for the year ended december 31 2003 based on our outstanding debt at december 31 2004 we would require approximately  460 million of cash flow from operating activities before net cash interest expenses to discharge our cash interest and principal obligations for the year ending december 31 2005 by comparison for the year ended december 31 2004 we generated 932 million of cash flow from operating activities before net cash interest expenses in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity or repurchase restructure or refinance some or all of our debt all of which we have done at various times in the last two years in 2003 we sold 784 towers located in the western twothirds of the united states and realized gross proceeds of 1967 million we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms in the future if at all the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders or subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy 

  

we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the remaining amount of our outstanding senior credit facility our 9 3  4  senior discount notes or our 8 1  2  senior notes upon their respective maturities therefore prior to the maturity of our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance andor restructure some or all of this debt we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or restructure this debt on acceptable terms or at all if we were unable to refinance restructure or otherwise repay the principal amount of this debt upon its maturity we may need to sell assets cease operations andor file for protection under the bankruptcy laws 

  

as of december 31 2004 we had approximately  365 million of additional borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility subject to maintenance covenants borrowing base limitations and other conditions furthermore we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt 

  

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates on new leases may decline 

  

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates on new leases decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers 

  

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness could be adversely affected 

  

demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate because many of their existing networks and expansion plans overlap in january 2003 the spectrum cap which previously prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area expired some wireless carriers have consolidated with each other and others may be encouraged to consolidate with each other as a result of this regulatory change and as a means to strengthen their financial condition economic conditions have resulted in the consolidation of several wireless service providers and this trend is likely to continue to the extent that our customers consolidate they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as many spaces on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to service our indebtedness in october 2004 cingular acquired att wireless as of december 31 2004 cingular and att were both tenants on 355 of our 3060 towers the contractual revenue generated by both of these tenants on these 355 towers at december 31 2004 was approximately 16 million if as a result of this transaction cingular were not to renew duplicate leases we could lose up to 50 of such revenue the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately two years 

  

in january 2005 sprint pcs and nextel agreed to merge which is expected to be consummated in the second half of 2005 as of december 31 2004 sprint pcs and nextel were both tenants on 349 of our 3060 towers the contractual revenue generated by both of these tenants on the 349 towers at december 31 2004 was approximately 16 million if this merger is consummated and either sprint pcs or nextel were not to renew duplicate leases we could lose up to 50 of such revenue the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 2 years 

  

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers particularly in our site development services business the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  

the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

  

    

revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five fiveyear periods at the option of the tenant our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan 

  

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan for example it could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

we are dependent on the financial stability of our customers and any deterioration in their financial condition may reduce the demand for our services which would adversely affect our growth strategy revenues and financial condition 

  

our business depends on the financial stability of our customers the economic slowdown and intense competition in the wireless and telecommunications industries over the past several years have impaired the financial condition of some of our customers certain of which operate with substantial leverage and certain of which have filed or may file for bankruptcy the financial uncertainties facing our customers could reduce demand for our communications sites increase our bad debt expense and reduce prices on new customer contracts this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations 

  

in addition we may be negatively impacted by our customers’ limited access to debt and equity capital recently when capital market conditions were difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers conserved capital by not spending as much as originally anticipated to finance expansion activities this decrease adversely impacted demand for our services and consequently our financial condition as a result we adjusted our business during 2002 and early 2003 to significantly reduce and subsequently suspend any material investment for new towers and our site development activities if our customers are not able to access the capital markets in the future our growth strategy revenues and financial condition may again be adversely affected 

  

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business 

  

our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes each contain certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants restrict our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments the acceleration of amounts due under one of our debt instruments would also cause a crossdefault under our other debt instruments 

  

sba senior finance inc “sba senior finance” which owns directly or indirectly all of the common stock of our operating subsidiaries is the borrower under our senior credit facility the senior credit facility requires sba senior finance to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding sba senior finance’s debt to annualized operating cash flow debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter in addition the senior credit facility contains additional negative covenants that among other things restrict our ability to commit to capital expenditures and build towers without anchor tenants our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to do so a breach of any of these covenants if not remedied within the specified period could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 

  

upon the occurrence of any default our senior credit facility lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events senior credit facility lenders by a majority vote can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a crossdefault under our indentures thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility andor indebtedness under our outstanding notes were to be accelerated our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility the senior credit lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility in such an event of default our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes 

  

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from our tenant leases we are very sensitive to the creditworthiness of our tenants 

  

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants wireless service providers often operate with substantial leverage and financial problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable the loss of customers and lower than anticipated lease revenues during the past three years a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers although these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business revenues andor the collectability of our accounts receivable 

  

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our longterm results 

  

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely basis to adjust to market slowdowns 

  

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

  

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

  

   

our losses are principally due to significant interest expense and depreciation and amortization in each of the periods presented above for the year ended december 31 2004 we recorded an asset impairment charge of 71 million and a charge associated with the writeoff of deferred financing fees and loss on the extinguishment of debt of 412 million we recorded an asset impairment charge of 130 million a charge associated with the loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt of 242 million and a restructuring charge of 21 million during the year ended december 31 2003 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 478 million a 607 million charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 142 and an asset impairment charge of 242 million in the year ended december 31 2002 we expect to continue to incur significant losses which may affect our ability to service our indebtedness 

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us 

  

our industry is highly competitive particularly with respect to securing quality tower assets and adequate capital to support tower networks competitive pressures for tenants on their towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues margins and financial condition increasing competition could also make the acquisition of quality tower assets more costly 

  

we compete with 

  

   

   

   

   

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  

the site development market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services we believe that a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site development business 

  

we may not be able to build andor acquire as many towers as we anticipate 

  

we currently intend to build 50 to 75 new towers during 2005 and to consummate a limited number of tower acquisitions however our ability to build these new towers is dependent upon 1 the availability of sufficient capital to fund construction 2 our ability to locate and acquire at commercially reasonable prices attractive locations for such towers and 3 our ability to obtain the necessary zoning and permits 

  

our ability to consummate tower acquisitions is also subject to risks specifically these risks include 1 our ability to identify those towers that would be attractive to our clients and accretive to our revenues 2 our ability to negotiate and consummate agreements to acquire such towers and 3 sufficient capital to fund such acquisitions due to these risks it may take longer to complete our new tower builds than anticipated the costs of constructing or acquiring these towers may be higher than we expect or we may not be able to add as many towers as we had planned in 2005 if we are not able to increase our tower portfolio as anticipated it could negatively impact our ability to make our goals for site leasing revenue 

  

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer and thomas p hunt our senior vice president and general counsel we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

  

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the development of and use of products that would permit multiple wireless carriers to use a single antenna share networks or increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of antennas needed by our customers in addition the deployment of wifi and wimax technologies could impact the network needs of our existing customers providing wireless telephony services this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

  

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

  

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects 

  

the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the fcc the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

  

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the fcc and faa regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

  

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa standards and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

  

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

  

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

  

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

  

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations including the principal and interest premium if any and additional interest if any on our outstanding 9¾ senior discount notes and our 8½ senior notes is dependent upon dividends and other distribution from our subsidiaries to us other than amounts required to make interest and principal payments on the notes we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay the principal interest and other amounts on the notes or make any funds available to us for payment the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us may be restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of the senior credit facility although the indenture governing the notes will limit the ability of our operating subsidiaries to enter into consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us these limitations are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions

 item 2 properties 

  

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 73000 square feet of space we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business and offices for new tower build projects are generally leased for periods not to exceed 18 months 

  

our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements easements and licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities of the 3060 towers in our portfolio approximately 10 are located on parcels of land that we own and approximately 90 are located on parcels of land that have leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements and easements licenses or 

  

rightofway granted by government entities in rural areas a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10000 square foot tract which supports towers equipment shelters and guy wires to stabilize the structure less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communication tower sites land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more in some instances we have entered into 99 year ground leases 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations or liquidity

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the information contained in our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto the following discussion includes forwardlooking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties including but not limited to those described in the “risks related to our business” section of this annual report our actual results may differ materially from those discussed below see “forwardlooking statements” and “risks related to our business” 

  

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the eastern third of the united states we generate revenues from our two businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own manage for or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

  

revenues derived from the leasing of antenna space at or on communication towers continued to increase as a result of our emphasis on our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites we focus our leasing and site development activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our towers are located during 2004 we completed our previously announced plan of disposing of our services business in the western third of the united states 

  

operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results you should be aware of the changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 

  

restatement of financial results 

  

on february 7 2005 the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission “sec” issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america “gaap” in light of this letter we initiated a review of our accounting practices and determined that we would adjust our method of accounting for certain types of ground leases underlying our tower sites and amortization of tower assets as a result we have restated our consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 included in this report 

  

we had historically defined the minimum lease term of our ground leases underlying our tower sites as the initial term of the leases and had been straight lining all rental payments due to the lessor evenly over this term which typically is five years in length as a result of the february 7 2005 letter from the sec we changed our rental expense recognition policy to redefine the minimum lease term as the period from lease inception through the end of the term in which all tenant lease obligations in existence at ground lease inception including renewal periods will be met if no tenant lease obligations existed at the date of ground lease inception the initial term of the ground lease is considered the minimum lease term all rental obligations due to be paid out over the minimum lease term including fixed escalations have therefore been straightlined evenly over the minimum lease term additionally if the minimum lease term ends prior to the originally established depreciable life of the tower typically 15 years we have shortened the depreciable life of the tower to coincide with the minimum lease term of the ground lease 

  

as a result of the adjustments described above the accompanying results of operations for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 have been adjusted to record additional rent expense included in cost of sales on the statements of operations of 57 million and 59 million respectively additional depreciation expense of 95 million and 101 million respectively a reduction of asset impairment charges of 40 million and 14 million respectively a decrease in provision for income taxes of 009 million and 001 million respectively and a decrease increase in loss from discontinued operations of 81 million and 34 million respectively 

  

the consolidated balance sheets have been adjusted to record additional straight line rent liabilities included in other long term liabilities of 24 million and 73 million a reduction in fixed assets of 55 million and 88 million as well as a decrease in assets held for sale of 002 million and 49 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively additionally retained earnings deficit have been reduced by 455 million and 425 million at december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively these adjustments did not have any impact on the cash flows of the company 

  

see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a summary of the effects of these changes on our consolidated balance sheets as of december 31 2003 as well as on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 the accompanying management’s discussion and analysis gives effect to these corrections 

  

site leasing services 

  

site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years and is renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant almost all of our site leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the current term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

  

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 

  

the table below details the percentage of total company revenues and gross profit contributed by site leasing services information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site leasing services business is included in note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

  

   

site development services 

  

our site development services business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance 

  

site development services revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management services to wireless communications companies our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from three to 12 months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of this project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 

  

our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on 

  

the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

  

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 

  

the table below provides the percentage of total company revenues and gross profit contributed by site development services information regarding the total and percentage of assets used in our site development services businesses is included in note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in this report 

  

   

in may 2004 our board of directors approved a plan of disposition related to the western site development services in june 2004 two business units were sold and two business units were closed within western site development services in the third quarter of 2004 the remaining two site development construction business units were sold gross proceeds realized from sales during the fiscal year ended december 31 2004 were 04 million and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations of 08 million was recorded which is included in loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2004 included herein our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

  

construction revenue 

  

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment 

  

asset impairment 

  

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

  

asset retirement obligations 

  

effective january 1 2003 we adopted the provisions of sfas 143 under the new accounting principle we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over its estimated useful life 

  

significant management estimates and assumptions are required in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations assumptions were made with respect to the historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs and the credit adjusted riskfree rate used to discount future obligations while we feel the assumptions were appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from estimates we will review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

  

operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results as our gross profit mix shifts more towards site leasing you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business in prior periods when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 

  

year ended 2004 compared to year ended 2003 

  

revenues 

  

   

site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our towers as of december 31 2004 we had 7257 tenants as compared to 6847 tenants at december 31 2003 during the year ended 2004 88 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2004 were related to new tenant installation and 12 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants during the year ended 2003 89 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2003 were related to new tenant installation and 11 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants 

  

site development construction revenue increased primarily as a result of the significant services contract awarded by sprint spectrum lp in mid 2003 which increased our volume of activity for the year ended december 31 2004 compared to the same period a year ago 

  

cost of revenues 

  

   

cost of revenues increased primarily due to increased activity associated with the significant services contract awarded by sprint in mid 2003 related to the site development construction business 

  

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit margin percentages 

  

   

gross profit and gross profit margin percentage for the site leasing business increased as a result of higher revenues per tower and tower operating cost reduction initiatives gross profit from site development construction decreased as a result of lower pricing without a commensurate reduction in cost and performance issues which resulted in actual margins below estimates 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

in 2004 we recognized approximately 71 million in asset impairment charges related to 40 towers by comparison in 2003 we recognized approximately 130 million of asset impairment charges related to 70 towers in addition selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to the reduction of bad debt expense of approximately 20 million as a result of improved collections and credit quality of our receivables 

  

operating loss from continuing operations 

  

   

the decrease in operating loss from continuing operations primarily was a result of higher gross profit and lower impairment charges in 2004 as compared to 2003 

  

other expense 

  

   

interest expense decreased primarily as a result of the repurchases and redemption of the 12 senior discount notes with proceeds from the 9¾ senior discount notes issued in december 2003 and proceeds from our senior credit facility which we obtained in january 2004 as well as repurchases of our 10¼ senior notes throughout 2004 

  

non cash interest expense increased due to the amortization of the original interest discount of the 9¾ senior discount notes which replaced the 12 senior discount notes 

  

the increase in loss from writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt was attributed to a writeoff of 131 million of deferred financing fees and 281 million loss on the extinguishment of debt associated with the early retirement of our 12 senior discount notes a significant portion of our 10¼ senior notes and the termination of the prior senior credit facility in the year ended december 31 2004 versus the writeoff of 44 million of deferred financing fees associated with the refinancing of our senior credit facility loans which were repaid in full and a loss on extinguishment of debt of 198 million relating to the repurchase of our 12 senior discount notes for the comparable period in 2003 

  

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

  

   

the increase in loss from discontinued operations was primarily a result of the gain from discontinued operations relating to the towers sold in the western tower sale in 2003 versus the loss on the western services business which was sold in 2004 

  

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 

  

   

the decrease in the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle was the result of the adoption of sfas 143 on january 1 2003 

  

net loss 

  

   

the decrease in net loss is primarily a result of higher gross profit lower asset impairment charges and lower depreciation expense and restructuring expense for the year ended december 31 2004 as compared with the year ended december 31 2003 

  

year ended 2003 compared to year ended 2002 

  

revenues 

  

   

site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our towers as of december 31 2003 we had 6847 tenants as compared to 6389 tenants at december 31 2002 during the year ended 2003 89 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2003 were related to new tenant installation and 11 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants during the year ended 2002 87 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2002 were related to new tenant installation and 13 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants 

  

both site development consulting and construction revenue decreased primarily as a result of the decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers for additional antenna sites and vigorous competition which adversely affected our volume of activity and the pricing for our services 

  

cost of revenues 

  

   

both site development consulting and construction cost of revenues decreased due primarily to lower levels of activity 

  

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit margin percentages 

  

   

gross profit and gross profit margin percentage for the site leasing business increased as a result of higher revenues per tower and tower operating cost reduction initiatives gross profit from both site development consulting and construction decreased as a result of the lower volumes and lower pricing without a commensurate reduction in cost 

  

operating expenses 

  

   

selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of reductions in the number of offices elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 600 employees whereas as of december 31 2002 we had approximately 750 employees 

  

in 2003 we recognized approximately 130 million in asset impairment charges related to 70 towers by comparison in 2002 we recognized approximately 150 million of asset impairment charges related to 144 towers the impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluations of the fair value of our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no tenants andor with little or deteriorating prospects for future lease up in addition the 2002 asset impairment charge included 92 million of goodwill impairment that was recorded during the first two quarters of 2002 which was determined to be impaired during june 2002 when the transitional impairment test of goodwill was performed under sfas 142 

  

in february 2002 as a result of the deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers we reduced our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities suspended any new investment for additional towers reduced our workforce and closed or consolidated offices of the 473 million charge recorded during the year ended december 31 2002 approximately 404 million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in progress and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites the remaining 69 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices during 2003 in response to a decline in expenditures by wireless services providers particularly with respect to site development activities we committed to new plans of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities of the 21 million charge recorded for the year ended december 31 2003 approximately 01 million related to the abandonment of new tower build work in process and trailing costs associated with previously abandoned new tower build work in process the remaining 20 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 165 employees and exit costs associated with the closing or consolidation of 17 offices annualized aggregate lease costs associated with the 17 offices closed or consolidated during 2003 were 07 million

this decrease in operating loss from continuing operations primarily was a result of lower restructuring and other charges and lower asset impairment charges in 2003 as compared to 2002 

  

other expense 

  

   

interest expense increased as a result of higher borrowings and higher weighted average interest rates additionally interest expense in 2002 was reduced as a result of our interest rate swap agreement that existed during most of 2002 the writeoff of deferred financing fees and loss on extinguishment of debt is attributable to a writeoff of 44 million of deferred financing fees associated with the termination of the prior senior credit facility and 198 million associated with the early retirement of a portion of our 12 senior discount notes and our 10¼ senior notes 

  

discontinued operations net of income taxes 

  

   

the decrease in loss from discontinued operations was the result of the gain on the sale of the 784 towers sold in the western tower sale in 2003 

  

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 

  

   

the decrease in the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle was the result of completing the transitional impairment test of goodwill under fas 142 effective january 1 2002 which resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change in the amount of 607 million representing the excess of the carrying value of certain assets as compared to their estimated fair value of this amount 585 million related to the site development construction segment and 22 million related to the site leasing reporting segment in 2003 we recorded 05 million in cumulative effect of accounting change related to the adoption of sfas 143 effective january 1 2003 which resulted in the recording of an asset retirement obligation on our tower portfolio 

  

net loss

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sba communications corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications inc “telecommmunications” which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of sba senior finance sba senior finance owns directly or indirectly the capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through our sba senior finance subsidiaries 

  

accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries even if we decided to pay a dividend we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend furthermore the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indenture for the 9¾ senior discount notes and the 8½ senior notes 

  

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

  

   

sources of liquidity 

  

in december 2003 sba communications and telecommunications coissued 4020 million of aggregate principal amount at maturity of their 9¾ senior discount notes which produced net proceeds of approximately 2671 million after deducting offering expenses a portion of the proceeds from the senior discount notes were used to tender repurchase and redeem all of our 12 senior discount notes during the first quarter of 2004 and to repurchase a portion of our 10¼ senior notes during the quarter ended march 31 2004 

  

during january 2004 sba senior finance closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of 4000 million this new credit facility consists of a 2750 million term loan which was funded at closing a 500 million delayed draw term loan and a 750 million revolving line of credit sba senior finance used the proceeds from the funding of the 2750 million term loan under the new senior credit facility in part to repay the old credit facility in full consisting of 1442 million of principal and accrued interest outstanding in addition to the amounts outstanding on the old credit facility we were required to pay 80 million to the lenders under the old credit facility to facilitate the assignment of the old credit facility to the new lenders sba senior finance has recorded additional deferred financing fees of approximately 65 million associated with this new credit facility between june and november 2004 we drew an additional 500 million on the delayed draw term loan as of december 31 2004 we were in full compliance with the financial covenants contained in this agreement and had an outstanding balance of 3234 million which consisted entirely of the term loan as of december 31 2004 we have approximately 365 million of additional borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility subject to maintenance covenants borrowing base limitations and other conditions 

  

on december 1 2004 we issued 2500 million of 8½ senior notes due 2012 which produced net proceeds of 2448 million after deducting offering expenses interest accrues on the notes and is payable in cash semiannually in arrears on june 1 and december 1 commencing june 1 2005 proceeds from the 8½ senior notes were used to repay 2365 million of our outstanding 10¼ senior notes of which we redeemed 1865 million in december 2004 and the remaining 500 million on february 1 2005 

  

in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants in addition to our capital restructuring activities completed in 2003 and 2004 we may explore a number of alternatives including selling certain assets or lines of business issuing equity repurchasing restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting existing indebtedness into shares of common stock any of which would dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that any of these strategies can be consummated or if consummated would effectively address the risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 

  

cash provided by operating activities was 142 million for the year ended december 31 2004 included in this amount is 152 million related to a decrease in shortterm investments associated with the sale of trading securities additionally growth in our site leasing business during the year ended december 31 2004 also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities offset by a net increase of other working capital items 

  

uses of liquidity 

  

during the first quarter of 2004 we repurchased and redeemed all 657 million of our outstanding 12 senior discount notes during the year ended december 31 2004 we repurchased in the open market 3732 million of our outstanding 10¼ senior notes of these repurchases 3068 million were repurchased with cash and 497 million were exchanged for 87 million shares of our class a common stock on february 1 2005 we called the remaining 500 million of our 10¼ senior notes additionally during the year ended december 31 2004 we paid approximately 637 million of cash for interest on our various debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities discussed above and the effect of this offering our cash interest requirements for 2005 are expected to be significantly lower than our requirements in 2004 

  

our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2004 were 90 million which was comprised of 40 million of tower upgrades and other capital improvements 19 million of new tower construction 18 million of earnouts and acquisitions and 13 million for general corporate expenditures due to the relatively young age of our towers and remaining capacity available to accommodate new tenants it is not necessary for us to spend a significant amount of funds for capital improvements or modifications to our towers to accommodate new tenants we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year on maintenance capital expenditures for 2005 we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately 100 million to 150 million primarily in connection with our plans to build 50 to 75 new towers additionally we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately 120 million to 130 million primarily in connection with acquiring towers during the first quarter of 2005 all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow from operations and availability under our senior credit facility the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio

as of december 31 2004 we had 3234 million outstanding under our senior credit facility based on this outstanding amount and rates in effect at such time we estimate our annual debt service including amortization to be approximately 157 million annually related to our senior credit facility 

  

the issuance of our 8½ senior notes in december 2004 as well as the repurchase of 1865 million of 10¼ senior notes in december 2004 pursuant to a tender offer and the redemption of the remaining 500 million of 10¼ senior notes in february 2005 is expected to result in a cash savings of approximately 26 million in debt service payments in 2005 

  

capital instruments

recent accounting pronouncements 

  

in december 2004 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued a revised sfas no 123 sharebased payment “statement 123r” which is effective for our third quarter of fiscal 2005 statement 123r requires companies to expense in their consolidated statement of operations the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards we are currently evaluating which application method will be applied once sfas 123r is adopted depending on the model used to calculate stockbased compensation expense in the future the implementation of certain other requirements of statement 123r and additional option grants expected to be made in the future the pro forma disclosure may not be indicative of the stockbased compensation expense that will be recognized in our future financial statements we are in the process of determining how the new method of valuing stockbased compensation as prescribed in statement 123r will be applied to valuing stockbased awards granted after the effective date and the impact the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on its financial statements 

  

the effective date of certain elements of sfas no 150 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity “statement 150” has been delayed indefinitely by the fasb these elements of statement 150 require that noncontrolling interests in limitedlife subsidiaries be classified as liabilities as a result of this indefinite delay we have not adopted these elements of statement 150 the company has adopted the other elements of statement 150 for which the effective date was not delayed currently we do not expect that the adoption of the remaining elements of statement 150 will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 

  

in december 2004 the fasb issued sfas no153 “exchanges of nonmonetary assets—an amendment of apb no 29” sfas 153 the amendments made by sfas 153 are based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged further the amendments eliminate the narrow exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replace it with a broader exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have “commercial substance” this standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring after july 1 2005 the adoption of this standard is not expected to impact our consolidated financial statements

disclosure controls and procedures  the company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the company’s reports under the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management including the company’s chief executive officer “ceo” and chief financial officer “cfo” as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure in designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures management recognized that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives as the company’s are designed to do and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures 

  

in connection with the preparation of this annual report on form 10k as of december 31 2004 an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the company’s management including the ceo and cfo of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule 13a15e under the exchange act in performing this evaluation management reviewed the company’s lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices partially in light of the recent attention and focus on such practices by restaurant and retail companies as a result of this review the company concluded that its previously established lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices were not appropriate and determined that the company’s annual rent and depreciation expense over the last several years had been understated accordingly as described below the company determined to restate certain of its previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction in the company’s lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices based on that evaluation the company’s ceo and cfo concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of december 31 2004 

  

management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting  management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule 13a15f under the exchange act the company’s internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the company’s management and board of directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations therefore even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 

  

management has assessed the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 in making its assessment of internal control over financial reporting management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations “coso” of the treadway commission in internal control—integrated framework 

  

in performing this assessment management reviewed the company’s lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices partially in light of the recent attention and focus on such practices by restaurant and retail companies as a result of this review management concluded that the company’s controls over the selection and monitoring of appropriate assumptions and factors affecting lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices were insufficient and as a result management has determined that the company’s annual rent and depreciation expense over the last several years had been understated on february 25 2005 the audit committee of the board of directors the “committee” and senior management determined to restate certain of the company’s previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction in its lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices 

  

management evaluated the impact of this restatement on the company’s assessment of its system of internal control and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted in the incorrect lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices represented a material weakness as a result of this material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting management has concluded that as of december 31 2004 the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria set forth by the coso of the treadway commission in internal control—integrated framework a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting is a control deficiency within the meaning of the public company accounting oversight board “pcaob” auditing standard no 2 or combination of control deficiencies that results in there being more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected pcaob auditing standard no 2 identifies a number of circumstances that because of their likely significant negative effect on internal control over financial reporting are to be regarded as at least significant deficiencies as well as strong indicators that a material weakness exists including the restatement of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of a misstatement 

  

the company’s independent registered public accounting firm ernst  young llp has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the company’s internal control over financial reporting this report appears below 

  

remediation steps to address material weakness  to remediate the material weakness in the company’s internal control over financial reporting subsequent to year end the company has implemented additional review procedures over the selection and monitoring of appropriate application of accounting standards affecting lease accounting and leasehold depreciation accounting practices 

  

change in internal control over financial reporting  there were no changes in the company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the company’s last fiscal quarter that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the company’s internal control over financial reporting 

  

report of independent registered public accounting firm on internal control over financial reporting 

  

we have audited management’s assessment included in the accompanying management’s annual report on internal control over financial reporting that sba communications corporation and subsidiaries did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 because of the effect of the company’s insufficient controls over the selection and monitoring of appropriate assumptions and factors affecting lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices based on criteria established in internal control—integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission the coso criteria sba communications corporation and subsidiaries management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit 

  

we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting evaluating management’s assessment testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion 

  

a company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles a company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that 1 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company 2 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company and 3 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 

  

because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

  

a material weakness is a control deficiency or combination of control deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected the following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment in its assessment as of december 31 2004 management identified as a material weakness the company’s insufficient controls over the selection and monitoring of appropriate assumptions and factors affecting lease accounting and leasehold depreciation practices as a result of this material weakness in internal control management concluded the company’s previously reported annual depreciation expense and rent expense had been understated and that previously issued financial statements should be restated this material weakness was considered in determining the nature timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2004 financial statements and this report does not affect our report dated march 14 2005 on those financial statements 

  

in our opinion management’s assessment that sba communications corporation and subsidiaries did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 is fairly stated in all material respects based on the coso control criteria also in our opinion because of the effect of the material weakness described above on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria sba communications corporation and subsidiaries has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2004 based on the coso control criteria 

  

we also have audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states the consolidated balance sheets of sba communications corporation and subsidiaries as of december 31 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december 31 2004 and our report dated march 14 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon

 item 1 business tableend   

general 

  

we are a leading independent owner and operator of over 3000 wireless communications towers in the eastern third of the united states we generate revenues from our two primary businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired we have built approximately 60 of our currently owned towers as of december 31 2003 we owned 3093 towers of which 3032 are in continuing operations in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks since our founding in 1989 we have participated in the development of more than 25000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major wireless markets in the united states 

  

site leasing services 

  

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts we believe that over the long term our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers lease additional antenna space on our towers due to increasing minutes of use and network coverage requirements we lease antenna space on the towers we have constructed the towers we have acquired and the towers we lease sublease andor manage for third parties our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless carrier tenants including att wireless cingular wireless nextel sprint pcs tmobile and verizon wireless and we believe our current tower portfolio positions us to take advantage of wireless carriers’ antenna and equipment deployment we believe our site leasing business is characterized by stable and longterm recurring revenues predictable operating costs and minimal capital expenditures we expect to grow our cash flows by adding tenants to our towers at minimal incremental costs by using existing tower capacity or requiring carriers to bear the cost of tower modifications because our towers are strategically positioned and our customers typically do not relocate we have historically experienced low customer churn as a percentage of revenue our lease contracts typically have terms of five years or more with multiple term tenant renewal options and provide for annual rent escalators we are focusing our leasing activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our towers are located additionally due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we expect future expenditures required to maintain these towers will be low 

  

the following chart shows the number of towers we built for our own account the number of towers we acquired the number of towers we reclassified or disposed of the number of towers held for sale and the number of towers owned for the periods indicated before discontinued operations treatment 

  

   

   

the following chart shows the number of towers owned for the periods indicated after discontinued operations treatment 

  

   

as of december 31 2003 we had 6847 tenants on our 3032 towers 

  

at december 31 2003 our same tower revenue growth was 93 and our same tower site leasing gross profit growth was 161 on the 3020 towers we owned as of december 31 2002 

  

the following chart includes details regarding our site leasing revenues and gross profit percentage 

  

   

to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in our towers we provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space the services we provide or may provide in the future include generator provisioning antenna installation equipment installation maintenance and backhaul which is the transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by an antenna to a carrier’s network some of these services are part of our site leasing services eg the generator provisioning and are recurring in nature and are contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the way they lease antenna space 

  

site development services 

  

our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance currently our largest site development project is the network development contract we were awarded by sprint spectrum lp we estimate that this contract will generate approximately 70 to 90 million in site development construction revenue over the next two years 

  

our site development customers include most of the major wireless communications and services companies including att wireless bechtel corporation cingular wireless general dynamics nextel sprint pcs tmobile and verizon wireless site development revenue was 842 million and 1250 million for the years ended december 31 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during the year ended december 31 2003 compared to the year ended december 31 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers particularly for our site development construction services and increased competition which adversely affected our volume of activity and the pricing for our services 

  

business strategy 

  

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

  

focusing on site leasing business with stable recurring revenues  we intend to continue to focus on and allocate substantially all of our capital resources to our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as longterm contracts builtin price escalators high operating margins and low customer churn the longterm nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business which is more reactive to changes in industry conditions by focusing on our site leasing business we believe that we can maintain a stable recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending 

  

maximizing use of tower capacity we generally have constructed our towers to accommodate multiple tenants and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we actively market space on our towers through our internal sales force 

  

geographically focusing our tower ownership we have decided to focus our tower ownership geographically in the eastern third of the united states we believe that focusing our site leasing activities in this smaller geographic area where we have a higher concentration of towers will improve our operating efficiencies reduce our overhead expenses and produce higher revenue per tower 

  

maintaining low cost structure with reduced capital expenditures we believe we have a low cost structure and we intend to proactively manage our cost structure to reflect the size and stage of our business and changes in the business environment in addition we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures since 2001 and intend to maintain lower levels compared to 1999 to 2001 of annual capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 

  

using our local presence to build strong relationships with major wireless service providers given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe that substantially all of what we do is best done locally consequently we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience expertise and relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships due to our presence in local markets we believe we are well positioned to capture additional site leasing business in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets 

  

capturing other revenues that flow from our tower ownership to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in our towers we provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space including antenna installation and equipment installation because of our ownership of the tower our control of the tower site and our experience and capabilities in providing installation services we believe that we are well positioned to perform more of these services and capture the related revenue 

  

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services 

  

company services 

  

we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices some of which are opened and closed on a projectbyproject basis operationally we are divided into three regions throughout the united states run by vice presidents each region is divided into subregions run by general managers and we have further divided each subregion into geographic territories run by local managers within each manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all site development operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

  

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology and site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our boca raton office 

  

customers 

  

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for most of the largest wireless service providers the majority of our contracts have been for pcs enhanced specialized mobile radio or esmr and cellular providers of wireless telephony services we also serve wireless data and internet paging pcs narrowband specialized mobile radio multichannel multipoint distribution service or mmds and multipoint distribution service or mds wireless providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller local regional or private operators we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 the following three customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues 

  

   

of our total revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 the following three customers represented at least 10 of our total revenues 

  

   

during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

  

   

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing goals are to 

  

   

   

   

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations personnel have revenue and gross profitbased incentive components in their compensation plans 

  

in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel at the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

  

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals 

  

competition 

  

we compete with 

  

   

   

   

   

   

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  

our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are five large independent tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international corp global signal inc spectrasite inc and aat communications corp and a large number of smaller independent tower owners in addition we compete with att wireless sprint pcs and other wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers 

  

we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including american tower corporation alcoa fujikura ltd bechtel corporation black  veach corporation general dynamics corporation lcc international inc and wireless facilities inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project we believe that we compete favorably in these areas 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 600 employees none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

  

regulatory and environmental matters 

  

federal regulations both the fcc and the faa regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas many faa requirements are implemented in fcc regulations these regulations govern the construction lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures require prior approval and registration of towers or structures wireless communications equipment and radio or television stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

  

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of the proposed tower or structure the relationship of the tower or structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor painting requirements antenna towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower or structure that 

  

requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting andor painting owners of wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with faa and fcc standards antenna tower and structure owners also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna tower or structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would 1 discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or 2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

  

owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 among other statutes which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing operation of wireless communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure in the event the fcc determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact statement which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure 

  

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower or structure placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency “rf” emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to rf emissions exposure to high levels of rf energy can produce negative health effects the potential connection between lowlevel rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

  

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services 

  

through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures in addition many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog of pending leases for antenna space on our towers varies from time to time and reflects the relatively shortcycle of three to six months of the antenna space leasing process leasing backlogs vary widely within a fiscal quarter and are generally lowest on the last day of a quarter as our customers strive to meet their own quarterly antenna site deployment goals as of december 31 2003 we had 136 new leases and 15 amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately  28 million of annual revenues as of december 31 2002 we had 150 new leases and 9 amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue these leases contractually provided for approximately  33 million of annual revenues 

  

our backlog for site development services was approximately 80 million as of december 31 2003 as compared to approximately 29 million as of december 31 2002 the increase in 2003 is attributable to a contract received from sprint for site development work which is expected to result in revenues of 70 million to 90 million over a two year period of which approximately 60 million is reflected in backlog as of december 31 2003 we had no backlog for pending tower acquisitions as of december 31 2003 

  

risks related to our business 

  

we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness 

  

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity 

  

   

   

our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance our earnings were insufficient to cover our fixed charges for the year ended december 31 2003 by 162 million and 184 million for the year ended december 31 2002 subsequent to december 31 2003 we obtained a new senior credit facility a portion of the proceeds from this facility were used to repay the then existing credit facility to purchase 12 senior discount notes in the open market to redeem all 12 senior discount notes outstanding on march 1 2004 and to repurchase 10¼ senior notes in the open market as adjusted for these transactions we would require approximately 535 million of cash flow from operating activities before net cash interest expenses to discharge our cash interest and principal obligations for the year ending december 31 2004 by comparison for the year ended december 31 2003 we generated 567 million of cash flow from operations before net cash interest expenses in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity or 

  

repurchase restructure or refinance some or all of our debt we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms if at all the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders or subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and as a result could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy 

  

we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the remaining amount of our outstanding senior credit facility our 10¼ senior notes and our 9¾ senior discount notes upon their respective maturities in 2008 2009 and 2011 therefore prior to the maturity of our outstanding debt we may be required to refinance andor restructure some or all of this debt there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or restructure this debt on acceptable terms or at all if we were unable to refinance restructure or otherwise repay the principal amount of this debt upon its maturity we may need to sell assets cease operations andor file for protection under the bankruptcy laws 

  

as of december 31 2003 adjusted for the transactions discussed above we would have had approximately 21 million of additional borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility subject to maintenance covenants borrowing base limitations and other conditions furthermore we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments some of which may be secured debt 

  

we are dependent on the financial stability of our customers and any deterioration in their financial condition may reduce the demand for our services which would adversely affect our growth strategy revenues and financial condition 

  

our business depends on the financial stability of our customers the economic slowdown and intense competition in the wireless and telecommunications industries over the past several years have impaired the financial condition of some of our customers certain of which operate with substantial leverage and certain of which have filed or may file for bankruptcy the financial uncertainties facing our customers could reduce demand for our communications sites increase our bad debt expense and reduce prices on new customer contracts this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations 

  

in addition we may be negatively impacted by our customers’ limited access to debt and equity capital recently when capital market conditions were difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers conserved capital by not spending as much as originally anticipated to finance expansion activities this decrease adversely impacted demand for our services and consequently our financial condition as a result we adjusted our business during 2002 and early 2003 to significantly reduce and subsequently suspend any material investment for new towers and our site development activities if our customers are not able to access the capital markets in the future our growth strategy revenues and financial condition may again be adversely affected 

  

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan 

  

our substantial indebtedness may negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan for example it could 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business 

  

our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes each contain certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants restrict our ability to 

  

   

   

   

   

   

if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments the acceleration of amounts due under one of our debt instruments would also cause a crossdefault under our other debt instruments 

  

sba senior finance inc “sba senior finance” which owns directly or indirectly all of the common stock of our operating subsidiaries is the borrower under our senior credit facility the senior credit facility requires sba senior finance to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding sba senior finance’s debt to annualized operating cash flow debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter in addition the senior credit facility contains additional negative covenants that among other things restrict our ability to commit to capital expenditures and build towers without anchor tenants our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests and comply with these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to do so a breach of any of these covenants if not remedied within the specified period could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility 

  

upon the occurrence of any default our senior credit facility lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events senior credit facility lenders by a majority vote can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a crossdefault under our indentures thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility andor indebtedness under our outstanding notes were to be accelerated our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility the senior credit lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility in such an event of default our assets may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations under the notes 

  

if our wireless service provider customers combine their operations to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow could be adversely affected 

  

demand for our services may decline if there is significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers as they may then reduce capital expenditures in the aggregate because many of their existing networks and expansion plans overlap in january 2003 the spectrum cap which previously prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area expired some wireless carriers may be encouraged to consolidate with each other as a result of this regulatory change and as a means to strengthen their financial condition economic conditions have resulted in the consolidation of several wireless service providers and this trend is likely to continue to the 

  

extent that our customers consolidate they may not renew any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as many spaces on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow in february 2004 cingular wireless and att wireless entered into an agreement by which cingular would acquire att in a transaction anticipated to close in late 2004 or 2005 as of december 31 2003 cingular and att were both tenants on 287 of our 3032 towers the contractual revenue generated by both of these tenants on these 287 towers at december 31 2003 was approximately 12 million if as a result of this transaction cingular were not to renew duplicate leases we could lose up to 50 of such revenue the average remaining contractual life of such duplicate leases was approximately 3 years 

  

similar consequences may occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antenna space wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers particularly in our site development services business the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  

the following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of our total revenues for the specified time periods derived from these customers 

  

   

we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments 

  

   

   

   

  

revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five fiveyear periods at the option of the tenant our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers furthermore our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned or our lease rates may decline 

  

if tenant demand for tower space or our lease rates for new tenants decrease we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our financial and other contractual obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand and potential lease rates for independently owned towers 

  

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from our tenant leases we are very sensitive to the creditworthiness of our tenants 

  

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants wireless service providers often operate with substantial leverage and financial problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable the loss of customers and lower than anticipated lease revenues during the past three years a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers although these bankruptcies have not had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business revenues andor the collectability of our accounts receivable 

  

our quarterly operating results for our site development services fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our longterm results 

  

the demand for our site development services fluctuates from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

although the demand for our site development services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts in addition the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long therefore we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely basis to adjust to market slowdowns 

  

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

  

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

  

   

our losses are principally due to significant interest expense and depreciation and amortization in each of the periods presented above we recorded an asset impairment charge of 170 million a charge associated with the writeoff of deferred financing fees and loss on extinguishment of debt of 242 million and a restructuring charge of 25 million during the year ended december 31 2003 additionally we recognized a loss net of taxes of approximately 77 million for the year ended december 31 2003 in connection with discontinued operations we recorded restructuring and other charges of 478 million a 607 million charge related to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 142 and an asset impairment charge of 255 million in the year ended december 31 2002 we recorded restructuring and other charges of 244 million in the year ended december 31 2001 

  

in 2004 we expect to incur material additional charges for the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt associated with the senior credit facility refinancing 10¼ senior note repurchases and 12 senior discount note repurchases and redemptions which occurred subsequent to december 31 2003 interest expense and depreciation charges will continue to be substantial in the future 

  

increasing competition in the tower industry may adversely affect us 

  

our industry is highly competitive particularly with respect to securing quality tower assets and adequate capital to support tower networks competitive pressures for tenants on their towers from these competitors could adversely affect our lease rates and services income in addition the loss of existing customers or the failure to attract new customers would lead to an accompanying adverse effect on our revenues margins and financial condition increasing competition could also make the acquisition of quality tower assets more costly 

  

we compete with 

  

   

   

   

   

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks and several of the other tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  

the site development market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services we believe that a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site development business 

  

the loss of the services of certain of our key personnel or a significant number of our employees may negatively affect our business 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key personnel we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key personnel we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer and thomas p hunt our senior vice president and general counsel we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key personnel if we were to lose any key personnel we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected we do not currently have a permanent chief financial officer and if we are unable to timely hire one our business may be negatively impacted further the loss of a significant number of employees or our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

new technologies and their use by carriers may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

  

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers for example the development of and use of products that would permit multiple wireless carriers to use a single antenna share networks or increase the range and capacity of an antenna could reduce the number of antennas needed by our customers this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

  

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency “rf” energy 

  

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to rf energy exposure to high levels of rf energy can cause negative health effects 

  

the potential connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years according to the federal communications commission “fcc” the results of these studies to date have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding health risks could cause a decrease in the demand for wireless communications services moreover if a connection between exposure to low levels of rf energy and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to claims relating to rf energy even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

  

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business in particular both the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate the construction and maintenance of antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio and television antennas in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communications equipment and television and radio stations operating from such towers and structures faa and fcc regulations govern construction lighting painting and marking of towers and structures and may depending on the characteristics of the tower or structure require registration of the tower or structure certain proposals to construct new towers or structures or to modify existing towers or structures are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower or structure will not present a hazard to air navigation 

  

antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or structures or install lighting to conform to faa standards and to maintain such marking painting and lighting antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any lighting outages certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the fcc to ensure compliance with environmental impact requirements failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

  

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require antenna tower owners and antenna structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower or structure construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new construction colocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

  

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

  

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes and hurricanes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance subject to deductibles to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a significant number of our towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  

we could have liability under environmental laws that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our operations like those of other companies engaged in similar businesses are subject to the requirements of various federal state local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations including those relating to the management use storage disposal emission and remediation of and exposure to hazardous and nonhazardous substances materials and wastes as owner lessee or operator of numerous tower sites we may be liable for substantial costs of remediating soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous materials without regard to whether we as the owner lessee or operator knew of or were responsible for the contamination we may be subject to potentially significant fines or penalties if we fail to comply with any of these requirements the current cost of complying with these laws is not material to our financial condition or results of operations however the requirements of these laws and regulations are complex change frequently and could become more stringent in the future it is possible that these requirements will change or that liabilities will arise in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

  

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

  

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our ability to pay our obligations including the principal and interest premium if any and additional interest if any on our outstanding 10¼ senior notes and our 9¾ senior discount notes is dependent upon dividends and other distribution from our subsidiaries to us other than amounts required to make interest and principal payments on the notes we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by 

  

them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations our operating subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation contingent or otherwise to pay the principal interest and other amounts on the notes or make any funds available to us for payment the ability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or transfer assets to us may be restricted by applicable state law and contractual restrictions including the terms of the senior credit facility although the indenture governing the notes will limit the ability of our operating subsidiaries to enter into consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to us these limitations are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions 

  

as a company whose common stock is publicly traded we are subject to the rules and regulations of federal state and financial market exchange entities 

  

in response to recent laws enacted by congress most notably the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 some of these entities have recently issued new requirements and some are continuing to develop additional requirements most notably the requirements associated with section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our material internal control systems processes and procedures will have to be in compliance with the new requirements and such compliance may require the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources and significant changes to such controls systems processes and procedures

 item 2 properties tableend   

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 73000 square feet of space we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business and offices for new tower build projects are generally leased for periods not to exceed 18 months 

  

our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements easements and licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities of the 3032 towers in our portfolio approximately 16 are located on parcels of land that we own and approximately 84 are located on parcels of land that have leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements and easements licenses or rightofway granted by government entities in rural areas a wireless communications site typically consists of up to a 10000 square foot tract which supports towers equipment shelters and guy wires to stabilize the structure less than 2500 square feet is required for a monopole or selfsupporting tower structure of the kind typically used in metropolitan areas for wireless communication tower sites land leases generally have an initial term of five years with five or more additional automatic renewal periods of five years for a total of thirty years or more in some instances we have entered into 99 year ground leases

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

we are a leading independent owner and operator of over 3000 wireless communications towers in the eastern third of the united states we generate revenues from our two primary businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for or lease from others the towers that we own have 

  

been constructed by us at the request of a carrier built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

  

the percentage of revenues derived from the leasing of antenna space at or on communication towers continued to increase as a result of our emphasis on our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites subsequent to the sale of 784 towers to aat communications corp during 2003 “western tower sale” we have focused our leasing activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our remaining towers are located 

  

operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results you should be aware of the significant changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results the 784 towers sold in the western tower sale during 2003 have been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles additionally 64 towers located in the western twothirds of the united states that we had previously decided to sell have also been accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as of december 31 2003 61 of these towers remain as held for sale all discussion related to the consolidated statements of operations for the periods discussed in this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” have been adjusted to reflect these towers as discontinued operations 

  

site leasing services 

  

site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of five years renewable for five fiveyear periods at the option of the tenant almost all of our site leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

  

cost of site leasing revenue primarily consists of 

  

   

   

   

   

   

for any given tower such costs are generally unrelated to the number of tenants on such tower as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 

  

site leasing revenues comprised 603 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2003 and 479 of total revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 site leasing contributed 931 of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2003 and 767 of total gross profit for the year ended december 31 2002 

  

as a result of the western tower sale we reduced our tower portfolio by 784 towers during 2003 to further improve efficiencies in our portfolio we decided to sell an additional 64 towers remaining in the western twothirds of the united states which were not part of the western tower sale three of these towers were sold during the fourth quarter of 2003 leaving 61 towers held for sale at december 31 2003 

  

gross profit margins on the towers sold in the western tower sale were relatively comparable to the gross profit margins on the towers we retained therefore the sale of these towers is not expected to have a material impact on our site leasing gross profit margin we do not anticipate making any other material changes to our tower portfolio in 2004 

  

as of december 31 2003 we owned 3032 towers substantially all of which are in the eastern third of the united states this number excludes the 61 towers held for sale at december 31 2003 

  

site development services 

  

our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance 

  

site development revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management services to wireless communications companies our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects both consulting and construction include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis time and materials based site development contracts are billed and revenue is recognized at contractual rates as the services are rendered our site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete for those site development consulting contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 

  

our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 

  

revenue from our site development construction business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

  

cost of site development consulting revenue and construction revenue include all costs of materials salaries and labor including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development consulting projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 

  

our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during 2002 and 2003 this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers and vigorous competition particularly for our site development construction services which adversely affected our volume of activity and the pricing for our services 

  

   

critical accounting policies and estimates 

  

we have identified the policies and significant estimation processes below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december 31 2003 included herein note that our preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

  

construction revenue 

  

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because we consider total cost to be the best available measure of progress on each contract these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on each contract nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our allowance is a matter of judgment see the consolidated balance sheet 

  

asset impairment 

  

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup in addition we make certain assumptions in determining an asset’s fair value less costs to sell for purposes of calculating the amount of an impairment 

  

charge changes in those assumptions or market conditions may result in a fair value less costs to sell which is different from management’s estimates future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required see note 18 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

asset retirement obligations 

  

effective january 1 2003 we adopted the provisions of sfas 143 under the new accounting principle we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made and we accrete such liability through the obligation’s estimated settlement date the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over its estimated useful life 

  

significant management estimates and assumptions are required in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases in determining the scope and fair value of our obligations assumptions were made with respect to the  historical retirement experience as an indicator of future restoration probabilities intent in renewing existing ground leases through lease termination dates current and future value and timing of estimated restoration costs and the credit adjusted riskfree rate used to discount future obligations while we feel the assumptions were appropriate there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from estimates we will review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary see note 5a to the consolidated financial statements 

  

results of operations 

  

as our gross profit mix shifts more towards site leasing operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 

  

year ended 2003 compared to year ended 2002 

  

revenues 

  

   

site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants and the amount of equipment added to our towers as of december 31 2003 we had 6847 tenants as compared to 6389 tenants at december 31 2002 during the year ended 2003 887 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2003 were related to new tenant installation and 113 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants during the year ended 2002 867 of contractual revenues from new leases and amendments executed in 2002 were related to new tenant installation and 133 were related to additional equipment being added by existing tenants additionally we have experienced on average higher rents per tenant due to higher rents from new tenants higher rents upon renewal by existing tenants and additional equipment added by existing tenants both site development consulting and construction revenue decreased primarily as a result of the decline in capital expenditures by wireless 

  

carriers for additional antenna sites and vigorous competition which adversely affected our volume of activity and the pricing for our services 

  

cost of revenues 

  

   

both site development consulting and construction cost of revenues decreased due primarily to lower levels of activity 

  

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit for the site leasing business increased as a result of higher revenues per tower and tower operating cost reduction initiatives gross profit from both site development consulting and construction decreased as a result of the lower volumes and lower pricing without a commensurate reduction in cost 

  

gross profit margin percentages 

  

   

operating expenses 

  

   

selling general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of reductions in the number of offices elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure as of december 31 2003 we had approximately 600 employees whereas as of december 2002 we had approximately 750 employees 

  

in 2003 we recognized approximately 170 million in asset impairment charges related to 70 towers by comparison in 2002 we recognized approximately 164 million of asset impairment charges related to 144 towers the impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluations of the fair 

  

value of our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no tenants andor with little or deteriorating prospects for future leaseup in addition the 2002 asset impairment charge included 92 million of goodwill that was recorded during the first two quarters of 2002 which was determined to be impaired during june 2002 when the transitional impairment test of goodwill was performed under sfas 142 

  

in february 2002 as a result of the deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers we reduced our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities suspended any new investment for additional towers reduced our workforce and closed or consolidated offices of the 473 million charge recorded during the year ended december 31 2002 approximately 404 million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in progress and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites the remaining 69 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices during 2003 in response to a decline in expenditures by wireless service providers particularly with respect to site development activities we committed to new plans of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities of the 25 million charge recorded for the year ended december 31 2003 approximately 06 million related to the abandonment of new tower build work in process and trailing costs associated with previously abandoned new tower build work in process the remaining 19 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 165 employees and exit costs associated with the closing or consolidation of 17 offices annualized aggregate lease costs associated with the 17 offices closed or consolidated during 2003 were 07 million 

  

operating loss from continuing operations 

  

   

this decrease in operating loss from continuing operations primarily was a result of lower restructuring and other charges and lower asset impairment charges in 2003 as compared to 2002 

  

other expense 

  

   

interest expense increased as a result of higher borrowings and higher weighted average interest rates additionally interest expense in 2002 was reduced as a result of our interest rate swap agreement that existed during most of 2002 the writeoff of deferred financing fees and loss on extinguishment of debt is attributable to a writeoff of 44 million of deferred financing fees associated with the termination of the prior senior credit facility and 198 million associated with the early retirement of a portion of our 12 senior discount notes and our 10¼ senior notes we expect to incur additional material charges in 2004 from the writeoff of deferred financing fees and extinguishment of debt associated with the senior credit refinancing the 10¼ senior note repurchases and the 12 senior discount note repurchases and redemptions which occurred subsequent to december 31 2003 

  

discontinued operations 

  

   

as previously discussed a total of 848 towers 784 towers sold in the western tower sale and 64 additional towers held for sale meet the criteria for discontinued operations treatment the increase in loss from discontinued operations resulted primarily from a loss on sale of 21 million related to the western tower sale 

  

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 

  

   

effective january 1 2003 we adopted a method of accounting for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas 143 under the new accounting principle we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our tower fixed assets the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately 05 million that is included in net loss for the year ended december 31 2003 

  

during 2002 we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas 142 which was adopted effective january 1 2002 as a result of completing the required transitional test we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of accounting change in the amount of 607 million representing the excess of the carrying value of certain assets as compared to their estimated fair value of the total 607 million cumulative effect adjustment 585 million related to the site development construction reporting segment and 22 million related to the site leasing reporting segment 

  

net loss 

  

   

this decrease in net loss is primarily a result of lower restructuring and other charges lower asset impairment charges and lower amounts resulting from a cumulative effect in change in accounting principle offset by an increase in interest expense and write offs associated with the extinguishment of debt we expect to incur additional net losses in 2004 

  

year ended 2002 compared to year ended 2001 

  

revenues 

  

   

site leasing revenue increased due to the increased number of tenants added to our towers higher average rents received and the increase in the number of towers in our portfolio as of december 31 2002 we had 6389 tenants as compared to 5558 tenants at december 31 2001 site development consulting revenues increased due to several new contracts for site acquisition and zoning services from wireless communications carriers site development construction revenue decreased due primarily to reduced carrier activity and price competition resulting from lower capital expenditures by wireless carriers on or around cell sites 

  

cost of revenues 

  

   

site leasing cost of revenue increased due to the increased number of towers owned resulting in an increased amount of lease payments to site owners and related site costs as well as increases in operating costs of certain sites maintenance and property taxes site development consulting cost of revenue increased reflecting higher levels of activity and increased personnel costs site development construction cost of revenue decreased due primarily to lower levels of activity 

  

gross profit 

  

   

gross profit for the site leasing business increased as a result of the increased number of tenants added to our towers and to a lesser extent additional towers added to our portfolio gross profit decreased for both site development consulting and construction this decrease primarily resulted from lower pricing for our services due to competition 

  

gross profit margin percentages 

  

   

operating expenses 

  

   

the decrease in selling general and administrative expense primarily resulted from a decrease in tower developmental expenses as well as the reduction of offices elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure that had previously been necessary to support our prior level of new asset growth but was no longer required as a result of the restructurings previously discussed included within selling general and administrative expenses is a provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts increased to 34 million for the year ended december 31 2002 from 26 million for the year ended december 31 2001 reflecting our assessment of a more challenging financial environment for our customers 

  

during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred restructuring charges in the amount of 473 million of the 473 million charge approximately 404 million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites the remaining 69 million of restructuring expense related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities 

  

in the first quarter of 2002 certain tower sites held and used in operations were considered to be impaired resulting in a 164 million impairment charge towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no tenants and little or no prospects for future leaseup in addition during the first six months of 2002 we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately 92 million resulting from the achievement of certain earnout obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july 1 2001 which was determined to be impaired and written off the 164 million and the 92 million are included within asset impairment charges in the year ended december 31 2002 consolidated statement of operations 

  

the increase in depreciation amortization and accretion is directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 2002 as compared to 2001 offset by a decrease in amortization resulting from the writeoff of goodwill which was recorded in connection with the implementation of sfas no 142 

  

operating loss from continuing operations 

  

   

this increase in operating loss was a result of increased restructuring and other charges and the asset impairment charges recorded in the year ended december 31 2002 

  

other expenses 

  

   

total other expenses increased primarily as a result of a reduction in interest income increased interest expense and increased noncash amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs the decrease in interest income was due to lower cash balances during 2002 the increase in interest expense was primarily due to higher principal amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility in 2002 as compared to 2001 and to a full quarter of interest expense on our 5000 million 10¼ senior notes in the first quarter of 2002 compared to a partial quarter of interest expense on these senior notes in the first quarter of 2001 although the aggregate principal amount of total debt increased from the prior year the resulting increase in interest expense associated with the higher principal in 2002 was offset in part by the interest rate reduction we recognized in connection with our interest rate swap agreement the increase in noncash amortization was primarily due to higher accretion on the 12 senior discount notes 

  

discontinued operations 

  

   

the increase in loss is primarily attributable to interest expense allocated to discontinued operations in 2002 no interest expense was allocated to discontinued operations in 2001 as a result of the lower debt balances in 2001 as compared to 2002 

  

cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 

  

   

during the period ended june 30 2002 we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas 142 which was adopted effective january 1 2002 as a result of completing the required transitional test we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of 607 million representing the excess of the carrying value of certain assets as compared to their estimated fair value at january 1 2002 of the total 607 million cumulative effect adjustment 585 million related to the site development construction reporting segment and 22 million related to the site leasing reporting segment 

  

net loss 

  

   

as a result of the factors discussed above net loss significantly increased from 2001 to 2002 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sba communications corporation “sba communications” is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications inc “telecommunications” which is also a holding company that owns the outstanding capital stock of sba senior finance sba senior finance owns directly or indirectly the capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries 

  

accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend the ability of our subsidiaries to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our current senior credit facility 

  

a summary of our cash flows is as follows 

  

   

sources of liquidity 

  

during 2003 we sold 784 sites representing substantially all of our towers in the western twothirds of the united states in exchange for gross cash proceeds of approximately 1967 million as a result of this transaction we produced cash from investing activities the purchase and sale agreement contained a number of provisions providing for adjustments to the purchase price we anticipate that the final gross cash proceeds to be realized from the western tower sale after all potential purchase price adjustments will be approximately 1941 million 

  

in december 2003 sba communications and telecommunications coissued 4020 million of its 9¾ senior discount notes which produced net proceeds of approximately 2671 million after deducting offering expenses proceeds from the senior discount notes were used to tender for approximately 1533 million of our 12 senior discount notes and for general working capital purposes 

  

during january 2004 sba senior finance closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of 4000 million this facility consists of a 2750 million term loan which was funded at closing a 500 million delayed draw term loan and a 750 million revolving line of credit sba senior finance used the proceeds from the funding of the 2750 million term loan under the new senior credit facility to in part repay the old credit facility in full consisting of 1442 million outstanding in addition to the amounts outstanding we were required to pay 80 million to the lenders under the old facility to facilitate the assignment of the old facility to the new lenders sba senior finance has recorded additional deferred financing fees of approximately 54 million associated with this new facility see note 14 of notes to consolidated financial statements for further details relating to the financial impact of this refinancing 

  

in addition to our capital restructuring activities completed in 2003 and the first quarter of 2004 in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to ensure continued compliance with our financial covenants we may explore a number of alternatives including selling certain assets or lines of business issuing equity repurchasing restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting our existing indebtedness into shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock any of which would dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that any of these strategies can be consummated or if consummated would effectively address the risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 

  

uses of liquidity 

  

we used the proceeds from the may 2003 credit facility discussed in this report cash on hand and a portion of the proceeds from the western tower sale to repay in full the prior credit facility which had 2550 million outstanding immediately prior to repayment as discussed above subsequent to december 31 2003 we used a portion of the proceeds from the january 2004 credit facility to repay the may 2003 credit facility to repurchase 12 senior discount notes and 10¼ senior notes in the open market and to redeem all outstanding 12 senior discount notes on march 1 2004 as a result primarily of the repayment of 255 million under a prior credit facility we used 1785 million of cash in financing activities 

  

our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2003 were 151 million as compared to 864 million for the year ended december 31 2002 this decrease is a result of lower investment in new tower assets during 2003 we built 13 new towers as compared to 2002 when we built 141 new towers and bought 53 existing towers we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during 2004 of 50 million to 80 million due to the relatively young age of our towers and remaining capacity available to accommodate new tenants it is not necessary for us to spend a significant amount of dollars for capital improvements or modifications to our towers to accommodate new tenants we estimate we will incur approximately 1000 per tower per year on these type of capital expenditures all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and to complete pending buildtosuit obligations 

  

cash used in operations was 298 million for the year ended december 31 2003 of this amount 152 million was related to an increase in shortterm investments and approximately 60 million was related to the reduction in accounts payable during 2003 we focused our efforts on improving our outstanding receivables balances as a result of these efforts our accounts receivable balance after allowances and writeoffs was improved by approximately 170 million additionally during 2003 approximately 848 million of cash was paid for interest on our various debt instruments as a result of our refinancing activities discussed above our cash interest requirements for 2004 are expected to be significantly lower than the requirements in 2003 

  

debt service requirements 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 4064 million outstanding of our 10¼ senior notes as of the date of this filing we had 3554 million outstanding of our 10¼ senior notes the 10¼ senior notes mature february 1 2009 interest on these notes is payable february 1 and august 1 of each year based on amounts outstanding at the time of this filing annual debt service requirements are approximately 364 million 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 2758 million outstanding of our 9¾ senior discount notes the 9¾ notes accrete in value until december 15 2007 at which time the notes will have a balance of 4020 million these notes mature december 15 2011 interest on these notes is payable june 15 and december 15 beginning june 15 2008 

  

at december 31 2003 we had 657 million outstanding of our 12 senior discount notes the 12 senior discount notes were originally scheduled to mature on march 1 2008 these notes were redeemed on march 1 2004 at the call price of 1075 of the aggregate principal amount 

  

as of december 31 2003 we had 1182 million outstanding under the senior credit facility in existence at that time as of march 10 2003 we had 2750 million outstanding under the new senior credit facility based on the outstanding amount of 2750 million and rates in effect at such time we estimate our annual debt service including amortization to be approximately 139 million related to our senior credit facility 

  

the issuance of our 9¾ senior discount notes and the new senior credit facility coupled with the retirement of the 12 senior discount notes open market purchases and exchanges of our 10¼ senior notes and the repayment of our prior senior credit facility will result in a cash savings of approximately 500 million in debt service and amortization payments in 2004 

  

capital instruments 

  

senior notes and senior discount notes 

  

the10¼ senior notes were issued by sba communications are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness the 9¾ senior discount notes were coissued by sba communications and telecommunications in december 2003 are unsecured rank pari passu with the senior indebtedness and are structurally senior to all indebtedness of sba communications both the 10¼ senior notes and the 9¾ senior discount notes place certain restrictions on among other things the incurrence of debt and liens issuance of preferred stock payment of dividends or other distributions sale of assets transactions with affiliates sale and leaseback transactions certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities 

  

may 2003 senior credit facility 

  

on may 9 2003 telecommunications closed on a senior credit facility with the senior credit lenders in the amount of 1950 million in november 2003 in connection with the offering of our 9¾ senior discount notes and our tender offer for 70 of our outstanding 12 senior discount notes sba senior finance a newly formed whollyowned subsidiary of telecommunications assumed all rights and obligations of telecommunications under the senior credit facility pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement with the senior credit lenders telecommunications was released from any obligation to repay the indebtedness under the senior credit facility simultaneously with this assumption telecommunications contributed substantially all of its assets consisting primarily of stock in our various operating subsidiaries to sba senior finance sba senior finance refinanced this credit facility in january 2004 and used the proceeds from the new facility to repay this facility in full 

  

this prior senior credit facility as amended provided for 950 million in term loans and 1000 million in revolving lines of credit which could be borrowed repaid and redrawn and which would have converted to a term loan january 28 2004 amortization of amounts borrowed under this facility was to commence in 2004 at an annual rate of 10 in 2004 and 15 in each of 2005 2006 and 2007 all remaining amounts were to be due and payable at maturity on december 31 2007 amounts borrowed under this facility accrued interest at base rate as defined in the agreement plus 300 basis points or the euro dollar rate plus 400 basis points additional interest of 35 per annum also accrued but was not due to be paid until maturity as of december 31 2003 32 million of this additional interest was converted to a term loan as a result at december 31 2003 we had 982 million outstanding under the term loan of the senior credit facility at variable cash rates of 516 to 517 excluding the 35 of additional interest and we had 200 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a rate of 515 as of december 31 2003 the remaining 800 million under the revolver was fully available to us the credit facility was prepayable at our option amounts borrowed under the credit facility were secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance’s assets in addition each of sba senior finance’s domestic subsidiaries guaranteed the obligations of sba senior finance under the senior credit facility and pledged substantially all of its assets to secure such guarantee in addition sba communications and telecommunications pledged on a nonrecourse basis all of the common stock of telecommunications and sba senior finance respectively to secure sba senior finance’s obligations under this senior credit facility 

  

this prior senior credit facility as amended required sba senior finance to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding its leverage debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges 

  

for each quarter the senior credit facility contained affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restricted sba senior finance’s and its subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and liens sell assets make or commit to make capital expenditures enter into affiliate transactions or saleleaseback transactions andor build towers without anchor tenants additionally as of december 31 2003 we were in full compliance with all of the financial covenants of this facility 

  

january 2004 senior credit facility 

  

on january 29 2004 sba senior finance closed on a new senior credit facility in the amount of 4000 million this facility consists of a 2750 million term loan which was funded at closing a 500 million delayed draw term loan which we have until november 15 2004 to draw and a 750 million revolving line of credit the revolving lines of credit may be borrowed repaid and redrawn amortization of the term loans commence september 2004 at an annual rate of 1 in each of 2004 2005 2006 and 2007 all remaining amounts under the term loan are due october 31 2008 there is no amortization of the revolving loans and all amounts outstanding under the revolving facility are due on august 31 2008 amounts borrowed under this facility accrue interest at either the base rate as defined in the agreement plus 250 basis points or a euro dollar rate plus 350 basis points this facility may be prepaid at any time with no prepayment penalty amounts borrowed under this facility are secured by a first lien on substantially all of sba senior finance’s assets in addition each of sba senior finances’s domestic subsidiaries has guaranteed the obligations of sba senior finance under the senior credit facility and has pledged substantially all of their respective assets to secure such guarantee in addition sba communications and telecommunications have pledged on a nonrecourse basis all of the common stock of telecommunications and sba senior finance to secure sba senior finance’s obligations under this senior credit facility 

  

this new senior credit facility requires sba senior finance to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding its debt to annualized operating cash flow debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter this new senior credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants that among other things restricts its ability to incur debt and liens sell assets commit to capital expenditures enter into affiliate transactions or saleleaseback transactions andor build towers without anchor tenants additionally this facility permits distributions by sba senior finance to telecommunications and sba communications to service their debt pay consolidated taxes pay holding company expenses and for the repurchase of senior notes or senior discount notes subject to compliance with the covenants discussed above sba senior finance’s ability in the future to comply with the covenants and access the available funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on its future financial performance had this facility been in place on december 31 2003 we would have had the ability to draw an additional approximately 21 million over the 275 million drawn at closing 

  

inflation 

  

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 

  

accounting pronouncements adopted in 2003 

  

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations “sfas 143” this standard requires companies to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred when the liability is initially recorded a company capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset upon settlement of the liability a company either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement we adopted this standard effective january 1 2003 as a result of our obligation to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases 

  

underlying a majority of our towers and our estimate as to the probability of incurring these obligations we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment of approximately 05 million during the first quarter of 2003 the adoption of sfas 143 resulted in an increase in tower fixed assets of approximately 09 million and the recording of an asset retirement obligation liability of approximately 14 million 

  

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements nos 4 44 and 62 amendment of sfas no 13 and technical corrections “sfas 145” sfas 145 requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas 4 extraordinary treatment is required for certain extinguishments as provided in apb opinion no 30 the statement also amended sfas 13 for certain saleleaseback and sublease accounting we adopted the provisions of sfas 145 effective january 1 2003 pursuant to sfas 145 our previously reported extraordinary item of 51 million related to the early extinguishment of debt was reclassified to operating expense in the accompanying december 31 2001 consolidated statement of operations 

  

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities “sfas 146” and nullified eitf issue no 943 sfas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred whereas eitf no 943 had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan sfas 146 requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value we adopted the provisions of sfas 146 effective january 1 2003 the adoption of sfas 146 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas 148 sfas 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2002 we adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas 148 as of december 31 2002 we will continue to account for stockbased compensation in accordance with apb 25 as such we do not expect this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

  

in april 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 149 “sfas 149” amendment of statement 133 on derivative instruments and hedging activities  this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities under statement of financial accounting standards no 133 “sfas 133” accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities the statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after june 30 2003 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 150 “sfas 150” accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances this standard was effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 except for mandatorily redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities that are subject to the provisions of this statement for the first fiscal period beginning after december 15 2003 the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 45 “fin 45” guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 

  

fin 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin 45 also clarifies requirements for the recognition of guarantees at the onset of an arrangement the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees used or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements of fin 45 are effective for interim or annual financial statements after december 15 2002 we implemented the disclosure requirements of fin 45 as of december 31 2002 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of this implementation 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation no 46 consolidation for variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 which requires all variable interest entities “vies” to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the vie in addition the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests but not the majority fin 46 is effective immediately for all vies and for all special purpose entities created or acquired after january 31 2003 for vies created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first quarter ended march 31 2004 the adoption of fin 46 did not have nor is it expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements

 item 1 business 

general 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the continental united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands we generate revenues from our two primary businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others the towers that we own have either been built by us at the request of a wireless carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative as of december 31 2002 we owned or managed 3877 towers in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks including designing a network with friendly site identification acquiring locations to place their antennas and transmission equipment obtaining zoning approvals building towers when necessary and installing and maintaining their antennas and transmission equipment since our founding in 1989 we have participated in the development of more than 20000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major wireless markets in the united states 

recent developments 

  as a result of certain estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility in 2003 the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003 

on march 17 2003 certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications corp “aat communications” to sell 679 towers or if aat communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers an aggregate of 801 towers which represent substantially all of our towers in the western twothirds of the us the “aat transaction” gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be 1600 million if 679 towers are sold or 2030 million if 801 towers are sold subject to adjustment in certain circumstances the aat transaction is expected to close in stages commencing on may 9 2003 and ending on september 30 2003 we intend to use substantially all of the proceeds net of anticipated transaction costs of approximately 50 million to reduce indebtedness upon consummation of the complete aat transaction we will own 3076 towers substantially all of which will be in the eastern third of the united states 

we entered into the aat transaction to address our anticipated noncompliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness the sale is subject to a number of conditions including an amendment to our senior credit facility we anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would among other things 1 waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification 2 modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and 3 permit certain actions that are part of the aat transaction we believe that the aat transaction in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility will eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from our auditors based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers and the amendment to the senior credit facility we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow 

company services 

we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices which are opened and closed on a projectbyproject basis operationally we are divided into regions throughout the united states run by regional vice presidents each region is divided into subregions run by general managers and we have further divided each subregion into geographic territories run by local managers within each manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology departments site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida we also have in our boca raton office certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel 

site leasing services 

in 1997 we began aggressively expanding our site leasing business by capitalizing on our nationally recognized site development experience and strong relationships with wireless service providers to take advantage of the trends toward 

colocation which is the placement of multiple antennas on one tower or other structure and independent tower ownership we believe our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants with minimal incremental costs additionally due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we believe future expenditures required to maintain these towers will be minimal 

the following chart shows the number of towers we built for our own account the number of towers we acquired and the number of tenants at yearend on our towers for the periods indicated 

  at december 31 2002 our same tower revenue growth on the 3734 towers we owned as of december 31 2001 was 16 and our same tower cash flow growth on these 3734 towers was 20 based on tenant leases signed and annualized lease amounts in effect as of december 31 2002 and 2001 

our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless carrier tenants including att wireless cingular nextel sprint pcs tmobile and verizon site leasing revenue was 1396 million for the year ended december 31 2002 and 1032 million for the year ended december 31 2001 we believe that over the long term our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers continue to lease antenna space on our towers 

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts we lease antenna space on 

 a significant number of our towers were built under our buildtosuit program through which we built towers for a wireless service provider on a location of their direction we retained ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower many wireless service providers chose the buildtosuit option as an alternative to owning the towers themselves our buildtosuit sites came from a variety of wireless carriers including alamosa pcs att wireless cingular horizon pcs sprint pcs triton pcs and tmobile 

to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in the towers we own we provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space the services we provide or may provide in the future include generator provisioning antenna installation equipment installation maintenance and backhaul which is the transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by an antenna to a carrier’s network some of these services are recurring in nature and are contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the way they lease antenna space 

in february 2002 we announced the reduction of our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities under this plan we suspended any material new investment for additional towers among other 

actions if the aat transaction successfully closes we will further reduce our tower portfolio by at least 679 towers and a maximum of 801 towers we do not anticipate making any material additions to our tower portfolio in 2003 

site development services 

our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including but not limited to the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 antenna installation and 3 radio equipment installation commissioning and maintenance we have capitalized on our leadership position in the site development business and our strong relationships with wireless service providers to build and acquire towers in locations that we believe are attractive to wireless service providers 

our site development customers currently comprise many of the major wireless communications and services companies including att wireless bechtel corporation cingular nextel sprint pcs tmobile and verizon site development revenue was 1250 million for the year ended december 31 2002 and 1397 million for the year ended december 31 2001 

our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during the year ended december 31 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to the substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers particularly for our site development construction services which adversely affected our volume of activity and our pricing levels during 2003 we expect these trends to continue consequently we anticipate continued decline in our site development revenues and profit margins 

business strategy 

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers key elements of our strategy include 

maximizing use of tower capacity we believe that many of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennae and that increased use of our owned towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we generally have constructed our towers to accommodate multiple tenants in addition to the anchor tenant and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers we actively market space on our own towers through our internal sales force 

geographically focusing our tower ownership we have decided to focus our tower ownership geographically to the eastern us upon consummation of the aat transaction substantially all of our remaining towers will be located in the eastern third of the us we believe that by focusing our site leasing activities in a smaller geographic area where we have such a high concentration of our towers we will improve our operating efficiencies and reduce our overhead expenses 

executing on a local basis we believe that substantially all of what we do is best done locally given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe our customers make decisions locally we believe that to be successful in tower leasing zoning and construction we must have a strong local presence in the markets we serve 

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site development services 

building on strong relationships with major wireless service providers we are well positioned to be a preferred partner in tower space leasing because of our strong relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications providers and our proven operating experience additionally we have a broad national field organization that allows us to identify and participate in site development projects across the country and that gives us knowledge of local markets and enhances our customer relationships 

capturing other revenues that flow from our tower ownership tenants who lease antenna space on our towers need a variety of additional services in connection with their operations at the tower site these services include installation maintenance and upgrading of radio transmission equipment antennas cabling and other connection equipment electricity backhaul which is provided generally by telephone lines or a microwave antenna network 

equipment shelters data collection and network monitoring tenants often outsource the performance of some or all of these required services to third parties including us because of our ownership of the tower our control of the tower site and our experience and capabilities in providing these types of services we believe that we are well positioned and intend to perform more of these services and capture the related revenue 

customers 

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for many of the largest wireless service providers the majority of our contracts have been for pcs broadband esmr and cellular customers we also serve wireless data and internet paging pcs narrowband smr multichannel multipoint distribution service or mmds and multipoint distribution service or mds wireless providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller local regional or private operators we depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site development and site leasing revenues for the year ended december 31 2002 cingular provided 146 and bechtel corporation contractor for att wireless and cingular provided 294 of our site development revenues for the year ended december 31 2001 nextel provided 116 sprint pcs provided 115 and bechtel corporation provided 109 of our site development revenues in addition for the year ended december 31 2002 att wireless provided 157 of our site leasing revenues for the year ended december 31 2001 nextel provided 104 of our site leasing revenues 

during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

 sales and marketing 

our sales and marketing goals are 

 we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers local managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with the wireless service providers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers at the regional and local levels make most decisions for site development and site leasing services with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations personnel have salesbased incentive components in their compensation plans 

in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel on the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff is charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals 

competition 

we compete with 

 wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are four large independent tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international corp pinnacle holdings inc and spectrasite inc and a large number of smaller independent tower owners in addition we compete with att wireless sprint pcs and other wireless service providers who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers 

we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including american tower corporation afl bechtel corporation black  veach general dynamics and westower the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project we believe that we compete favorably in these areas 

employees 

as of february 28 2003 we had approximately 650 employees none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good 

regulatory and environmental matters 

federal regulations both the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications these regulations govern the construction and marking and painting of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of proposed tower structures the relationship of the structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the towers to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting marking andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be 

registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting marking andor painting requirements owners of wireless transmission towers may have an obligation to maintain marking painting and lighting to conform to faa and fcc standards tower owners also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would 1 discriminate between different providers of personal wireless services or 2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on each applicant to investigate any potential environmental effects of operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed tower would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental assessment which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain rf emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements the potential connection between rf emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition and leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers in addition many local zoning authorities require tower owners to post bonds or cash collateral to secure their removal obligations local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new transmission towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

backlog 

our backlog for site development services was 292 million as of december 31 2002 as compared to 588 million as of december 31 2001 we had no backlog for pending tower acquisitions as of december 31 2002 as compared to 145 towers as of december 31 2001 additionally we had a backlog for 15 new tower builds as of december 31 2002 as compared to 400 as of december 31 2001

risk factors 

  our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business 

our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes each contain certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness sell assets for less than fair market value pay dividends redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility will also cause a crossdefault under both of our indentures 

sba telecommunications inc “sba telecommunications” our principal subsidiary which owns directly or indirectly all of the common stock of our other subsidiaries is the borrower under our senior credit facility the senior credit facility requires sba telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding sba telecommunications’ consolidated debt coverage debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses the senior credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants which among other things require us to submit audited financial statements without a “goingconcern” qualification in the audit opinion and restricts our ability to incur debt and liens sell assets commit to capital expenditures enter into affiliate transactions or saleleaseback transactions andor build towers without anchor tenants our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to do so a breach of any of these covenants if not remedied within the specified period could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility based on declines that we have been experiencing in our site development business and that we believe will continue in 2003 we estimated that we would not be in compliance with one or more of the senior credit facility’s existing financial ratios or tests in 2003 

as a result of these estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility in 2003 the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003 

the issuance of this audit opinion with a “goingconcern” qualification if not remedied by april 30 2003 would be an event of default under our senior credit facility upon the occurrence of this or any other event of default our lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events our senior credit facility lenders by a majority vote can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a crossdefault in our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility andor indebtedness under our 10¼ senior notes or 12 senior discount notes were to be accelerated our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility 

as part of our plan to addresss the anticipated noncompliance with these financial covenants and to reduce our aggregate level of indebtedness certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications to sell 679 towers or if aat communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers an aggregate of 801 towers the gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be 1600 million if 679 towers are sold or 2030 million if 801 towers are sold subject to adjustment in certain circumstances however the aat transaction is subject to a number of conditions including an amendment to our senior credit facility we anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would among other things 1 waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification 2 modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and 3 permit 

certain actions that are part of the aat transaction we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these waivers andor amendments especially in light of the recent financial performance of the wireless telecommunications industry and us or that if we obtain them we will be able to comply with the new financial covenants in the future nor can we assure you that even if we do receive the necessary amendment to our senior credit facility that the aat transaction will be consummated 

a full discussion of the impact of these possible defaults and management’s plans to address the liquidity and other concerns that arise as a result of the possible defaults and our significant level of indebtedness is discussed below under the section entitled “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  going concern” 

we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness 

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity 

 our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you for example it could 

 our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2002 we would require approximately 923 million of cash flow from operations before net cash interest expenses to discharge our cash interest and principal obligations for the twelve months ending december 31 2003 this amount is expected to increase in 2004 as our 12 senior discount notes first began to pay cash interest on march 1 2003 by comparison for the twelve months ended december 31 2002 we generated 571 million of cash flow from operations before net cash interest expenses if we do not materially increase our cash flow in the future we may not be able to meet our principal and interest payments on our debt obligations in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity or repurchase restructure or refinance some or all of our debt we may not be able to effectuate any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms if at all the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy 

based on our current estimates we may not have sufficient liquidity or cash flow from operations to repay the full principal amount of our 12 senior discount notes andor our 10¼ senior notes upon their respective maturities therefore prior to the maturity of our notes we may be required to refinance andor restructure some or all of our outstanding notes there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance or restructure these notes on acceptable terms or at all if we were unable to refinance restructure or otherwise repay the principal amount of these notes upon their maturity we may need to sell assets cease operations andor file for protection under the bankruptcy laws 

we pay interest on amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility at variable interest rates we have in the past and may again in the future enter into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our debt from fixed to 

variable rates therefore if interest rates were to increase the amount of interest that we would have to pay would increase 

  we may be adversely affected by an economic slowdown 

the significant general slowdown in the us economy has negatively affected 1 the financial condition of wireless service providers 2 the availability of capital and the willingness of wireless service providers to utilize capital to expand their networks and 3 may negatively affect the growth rate of consumer demand for wireless services we believe that the environment for continued expenditures by wireless service providers deteriorated throughout 2002 and has not materially improved declining subscriber growth and prospects for positive cash flow by wireless service providers have adversely affected the access to and cost of capital for wireless service provides as evidenced by declines in the market value of both their debt and equity securities as a result of the economic slowdown and the negative impact of such slowdown on the debt and equity markets we have adjusted our business to significantly reduce and subsequently suspend any material new investment for new towers 

we believe that if the capital markets conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers will continue to choose to conserve capital and may not spend as much as originally anticipated if wireless carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remains weak or deteriorates further we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business potentially the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the valuation of certain of our longlived assets may be negatively impacted short term variable capital markets conditions may adversely impact carrier demand for our tower space and consequently our site leasing revenue and the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us 

  we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned 

if tenant demand for tower space decreases we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand for independentlyowned towers tenant demand includes both the number of tenants and the lease rates they are willing to pay 

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and several of the independent tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity price quality of service and density within a geographic market historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  if our wireless service provider customers consolidate or merge with each other to a significant degree our growth our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow could be adversely affected 

significant consolidation among our wireless service provider customers may result in reduced capital expenditures in the aggregate because the existing networks of many wireless carriers overlap as do their expansion plans similar consequences might occur if wireless service providers engage in extensive sharing or roaming or resale arrangements as an alternative to leasing our antennae space in january 2003 the spectrum cap which previously prohibited wireless carriers from owning more than 45 mhz of spectrum in any given geographical area expired some wireless carriers may be encouraged to consolidate with each other as a result of this regulatory change and as a means to strengthen their financial condition demand for antennae space on communication sites may be adversely affected by consolidation of our wireless service provider customers economic conditions have resulted in the consolidation of several wireless service providers and this trend is likely to continue to the extent that our customers consolidate they may terminate any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as many spaces on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow 

wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us or others the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  if demand for wireless communication services decreases our revenue will be adversely affected 

substantially all of our customers to date have been providers of wireless communication services or agents acting on behalf of wireless communication providers if demand for wireless communication services decreases our revenue growth will be and our revenue may be adversely affected this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations demand for both our site leasing and site development services is dependent on demand for communication sites from wireless service providers which in turn is dependent on the demand for wireless services a slowdown in the growth of or reduction in demand in a particular wireless communication segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites most types of wireless services currently require groundbased network facilities including communication sites for transmission and reception the extent to which wireless service providers lease these communication sites depends on a number of factors beyond our control including 

   we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue 

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers that vary at any given time particularly in the site development services side of our business the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of total revenues derived from such customers 

  we also have client concentrations with respect to revenues in each of our financial reporting segments of our total site development consulting revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 the following two customers represented 638 of total revenue from this segment cingular represented 296 and bechtel corporation represented 342 of our total site development construction revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 one customer bechtel corporation represented 281 of such revenue of our total site leasing revenue for the year ended december 31 2002 one customer att wireless represented 157 of such revenue 

revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers moreover our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is very sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants 

due to the longterm nature of our tenant leases we like others in the tower industry are dependent on the continued financial strength of our tenants wireless service providers often operate with substantial leverage and financial problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable in the loss of customers and the anticipated lease revenues or in a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities during the past three years a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers although these bankruptcies have not yet had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues pending bankruptcies and any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business revenues andor the collectibility of our accounts receivable 

  our quarterly operating results fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our longterm results 

the number of tenants we add to our towers and the demand for our site development services fluctuate from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

 although the demand for our services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments budgetary cycles and pressures and general economic conditions in addition under lease terms typical in the tower industry revenue generated by new tenant leases usually commences upon installation of the tenant’s equipment on the tower rather than upon execution of the lease which can be 90 days or more after the execution of the lease 

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

 our losses are principally due to significant interest expense and depreciation and amortization in each of the years 2002 2001 and 2000 restructuring and other charges of 776 million and 244 million in 2002 and 2001 respectively and an 806 million charge related to the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in 2002 related to the adoption of sfas no 142 

we expect to continue to have significant losses in 2003 interest expense and depreciation charges will continue to be substantial in 2003 we also expect to incur additional restructuring expenses and to record an expense associated with the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of sfas no 143 furthermore in connection with the anticipated sale of the 679 towers on may 9 2003 we anticipate recognizing a loss of approximately 65 million 

as a result of these factors we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant losses 

  our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television antennae in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communication devices and television and radio stations operating from towers such regulations control construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of tower facilities certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation tower owners may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or install lighting to conform to faa standards and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting failures failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction or modification local regulations can delay prevent or increase the cost of new tower construction colocations or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition new regulations may be adopted that increase delays or result in additional costs to us these factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth and operations 

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to loss limits and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a tower or group of towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  steven e bernstein controls the outcome of shareholder votes and therefore disinterested shareholders will not control many corporate governance matters 

steven e bernstein our chairman of the board controls 100 of the outstanding shares of class b common stock our class b common stock has the right to 10 votes for each share provided that the outstanding shares of class b common stock represent more than 10 of the aggregate amount of class a and class b common stock outstanding as of march 14 2003 the class b common stock represented 107 of the aggregate amount of common stock outstanding as of march 14 2003 mr bernstein controlled approximately 55 of the total voting power of both classes of our common stock as a result mr bernstein has the ability to control the outcome of all matters determined by a majority vote of our common shareholders when voting together as a single class consequently disinterested shareholders will not be able to determine who is elected as a director or the outcome of other corporate governance matters subject to approval by the majority of the outstanding shares 

the loss of the services of certain of our key senior executives may negatively affect our business 

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key senior executives we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key senior executives we have employment agreements with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer kurt l bagwell our senior vice president and chief operating officer and thomas p hunt our senior vice president and general counsel we do not have employment agreements with any of our other key senior executive officers if we were to lose any key senior executive we may not be able to find an appropriate replacement on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected our chief financial officer resigned as of march 31 2003 and we are currently seeking his replacement 

if we are unable to attract retain or manage skilled employees it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

our business particularly site development services involves the delivery of professional services and is laborintensive the loss of a significant number of employees our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified employees or adequately develop and motivate the skilled employees we have hired could have a material adverse effect on our business we compete with other wireless communications firms and other enterprises for employees with the skills required to perform our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of highlyskilled employees in the future or that we will continue to be successful in training retaining and motivating employees 

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may have a material adverse effect on our operations our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations except as necessary to be distributed to us to cover holding company expenses including interest payments on our 10¼ senior notes and 12 senior discount notes even if our subsidiaries determined to make a distribution to us applicable state law and contractual restrictions including dividend covenants contained in our senior credit facility may restrict or prohibit these dividends or distributions 

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect the value of your investment 

the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for the common stock of companies in the past certain broad market fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a decline in the market price of our class a common stock 

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders during 2002 we adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

  our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio frequency emissions especially if such emissions are demonstrated to cause negative health effects 

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to radio frequency emissions the potential connection between radio frequency emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services 

if a connection between radio frequency emissions and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to numerous claims relating to radio frequency emissions even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our operations costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected 

new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations for example the fcc has granted license applications for several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide mobile voice and data services these systems 

are highly capital intensive and mobile satellite systems could compete with landbased wireless communications systems in addition products are currently being developed which may permit multiple wireless carriers to use a single antenna to share networks or to increase the range and capacity of an antenna which if successful could reduce the number of antenna needed by our customers 










 item 2 properties 

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 73000 square feet of space we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business and offices for new tower build projects are generally leased for periods not to exceed 18 months our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements easements and licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities 




 item 3 legal proceedings 

from time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business we are not a party to any legal proceeding the adverse outcome of which individually or taken together with all other legal proceedings is expected to have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the continental united states puerto rico and the us virgin islands we generate revenues from our two primary businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for or lease from others the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 

we are continuing to shift our revenue stream from project driven revenues to recurring revenues through the leasing of antenna space at or on communication towers we intend to emphasize our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites subsequent to the consummation of the aat transaction we intend on focusing our leasing activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our remaining towers will be located 

site leasing services 

site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years renewable for five 5year periods at the option of the tenant almost all of our site leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators which average 34 per year including the renewal option periods site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 

cost of site leasing revenue consists of 

 for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 

our same tower revenue growth on the 3734 towers we owned as of december 31 2001 was 16 and our same tower cash flow growth on these 3734 towers was 20 based on site leasing contracts signed and annual lease contracts in effect as of december 31 2002 and 2001 

in february 2002 we announced the reduction of our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities under this plan we suspended any material new investment for additional towers among other 

actions if the aat transaction successfully closes we will further reduce our tower portfolio by at least 679 towers and a maximum of 801 towers we do not anticipate making any material additions to our tower portfolio in 2003 

site development services 

site development services revenues are also received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management services to wireless communications companies our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price or milestone basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis our site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion revenue from our site development business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 

our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during the year ended december 31 2002 this decrease was primarily attributable to the substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers particularly for our site development construction services which adversely affected our volume of activity and our pricing levels during 2003 we expect these trends to continue consequently we anticipate continued decline in our site development revenues and profit margins 

2002 developments 

in february 2002 as a result of the continuing deterioration of the capital market conditions for wireless carriers we announced that under a plan approved by our board of directors we were reducing our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities suspending any material new investment for additional towers reducing our workforce and closing or consolidating offices under those capital market conditions we did not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we were contractually obligated to build or buy thereby resulting in the abandonment of a majority of our then existing new tower build and acquisition work in process during 2002 in connection with this restructuring a portion of our workforce had been reduced and certain offices have been closed substantially all of which were primarily dedicated to new tower development activities in addition during the first quarter of 2002 certain tower assets held and used in operations were determined to be impaired and written down to their fair value as a result of the implementation of our plans we recorded a restructuring charge of 637 million in accordance with sfas 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets andemerging issues task force 943 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring of the 637 million charge recorded during the year ended december 31 2002 approximately 404 million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites and 164 million related to the impairment of approximately 144 tower sites held and used in operations the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process resulted in the writeoff of all costs incurred to date the impairment of operating tower assets results primarily from our evaluation of the fair value of our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future leaseup the remaining 69 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities 

on january 1 2002 we adopted sfas no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas 142 goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of 

impairment in value are present under the transitional provisions of sfas 142 we recorded a noncash impairment charge of 806 million as of the effective date of adoption january 1 2002 the impairment charge has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 two of our three operating segments were identified as reporting units in which we recognized an impairment loss of the total 806 million cumulative effect adjustment 616 million related to the site development construction segment and 190 million related to our site leasing segment 

during 2002 we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately 134 million resulting from the achievement of certain earnout obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july 1 2001 in accordance with sfas 142 in addition to the transitional test described above goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually or at any time that indicators of impairment are present we determined that as of june 30 2002 indicators of impairment were present thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed the indicators of impairment during the quarter ended june 30 2002 giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall company value continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans and related demand for wireless construction services and perceived reduction in value of similar site development construction services businesses as a result of this analysis using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value 134 million of goodwill within the site development construction reporting unit was determined to be impaired as of june 30 2002 and was written off in the second quarter of 2002 the 134 million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 as of december 31 2002 we did not have any remaining goodwill or other intangible assets subject to sfas 142 

since the beginning of 2002 the environment for continued expenditures by wireless service providers has deteriorated declining subscriber growth and prospects for positive cash flow by wireless service providers have adversely affected the access to and cost of capital for wireless service provides as evidenced by declines in the market value of both their debt and equity securities we believe that if the capital market conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers will choose to conserve capital and may not spend as much as originally anticipated if wireless carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remains weak or deteriorates further we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business potentially the collectibility of our accounts receivable and the valuation of certain of our longlived assets may be negatively impacted short term variable capital markets conditions may adversely impact carrier demand for our tower space and consequently our site leasing revenue and the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us we believe that over the longer term however site leasing revenues will continue to increase as carriers continue to deploy new antenna sites to address issues of network capacity and quality 

2003 developments 

in february 2003 in response to the continued deterioration in expenditures by wireless service providers particularly with respect to site development activities we committed to a new plan of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities including reduction in workforce and closing or consolidation of offices we anticipate closing an additional 9 to 15 offices and eliminating the positions of 70 to 100 employees during the first quarter of 2003 substantially all related to our site development operations we anticipate incurring a restructuring charge related to these costs of up to 20 million 

on march 17 2003 certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications to sell 679 towers or if aat communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers an aggregate of 801 towers which represent substantially all of our towers in the western twothirds of the us gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be 1600 million if 679 towers are sold or 2030 million if 801 towers are sold subject to adjustment in certain circumstances the aat transaction is expected to close in stages commencing on may 9 2003 and ending on september 30 2003 we intend to use substantially all of the proceeds net of anticipated transaction costs of approximately 50 million to reduce indebtedness upon consummation of the complete aat transaction we will own 3076 towers substantially all of which will be in the eastern third of the united states 

we entered into the aat transaction to address our anticipated noncompliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness the sale is subject to a number of conditions including an amendment to our senior credit facility we anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would among other things 1 waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification 2 modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and 3 permit certain actions that are part of the aat transaction we believe that the aat transaction in 

conjunction with the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility will upon consummation eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from our auditors based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers and the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow 

going concern 

we have significant borrowings under our senior credit facility our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes each containing certain covenants among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness sell assets for less than fair market value pay dividends redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments the senior credit facility requires sba telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding it’s consolidated debt coverage debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated ebitda earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses we were in full compliance with all of the financial ratios and tests as of december 31 2002 based on declines that we have been experiencing in our site development business and that we believe will continue in 2003 we estimated that we would not be in compliance with one or more of the senior credit facility’s existing financial ratios or tests in 2003 

as a result of these estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility during 2003 the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003 

the issuance of this audit opinion with a “goingconcern” qualification if not remedied by april 30 2003 would be an event of default under our senior credit facility upon the occurrence of this or any other event of default our lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events our senior credit facility lenders by a majority vote can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a crossdefault in our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility andor indebtedness under our 10¼ senior notes or 12 senior discount notes were to be accelerated our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness if we were unable to repay amounts that became due under the senior credit facility our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility 

as part of our plan to address our anticipated noncompliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications to sell 679 towers or if aat communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers an aggregate of 801 towers we are also currently exploring and may from time to time take advantage of various strategic opportunities including but not limited to the sale of certain assets or lines of business the issuance of equity or the repurchasing restructuring or refinancing of some or all of our debt we believe that the aat transaction in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility will upon consummation eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from our auditors with respect to our 2002 consolidated financial statements furthermore based on our current estimates subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers and the amendment to the senior credit facility we expect to have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow however we cannot assure you that either the aat transaction andor any other plan or action can be consummated or if consummated would effectively address our liquidity concerns the possible defaults under our debt instruments or any of the other risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 

based on our previous experience with our lender syndicate for our senior credit facility we believe that we will be able to successfully negotiate with our present senior credit bank syndicate an amendment to our senior credit facility that 1 waives any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification 2 modifies the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and 3 permits certain actions that are part of the aat transaction this would thereby permit us to prevent the occurrence of any event of default or the acceleration of our indebtedness however our prior ability to obtain necessary waivers andor amendments does not insure our ability to obtain these waivers andor amendments especially in light of the recent financial performance of the wireless telecommunications industry and us 

the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from this uncertainty 

results of operations 

as we continue to shift our revenue mix more towards site leasing operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 

year ended 2002 compared to year ended 2001 

total revenues increased 90 to 2647 million for 2002 from 2429 million for 2001 total site development revenue decreased 105 to 1250 million in 2002 from 1397 million in 2001 due to a decrease in site development construction revenue site development construction revenue decreased 153 to 978 million for 2002 from 1155 million for 2001 due primarily to reduced carrier activity and price competition resulting from lower capital expenditures by wireless carriers on or around cell sites we believe that wireless carriers will continue to conserve capital in 2003 which may continue to adversely affect site development revenues site development consulting revenues increased 122 to 272 million for 2002 from 243 million for 2001 this increase is due to several new contracts for site acquisition and zoning services from wireless communications carriers site leasing revenue increased 354 to 1396 million for 2002 from 1032 million for 2001 due to the increased number of tenants added to our towers higher average rents received and the increase in the number of towers in our portfolio if the aat transaction is consummated with the sale of either 679 or 801 towers we expect to have lower leasing revenue and tower cash flow on an absolute basis as a result of our reduced number of towers we expect that leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth will continue to increase during 2003 on the towers remaining in our portfolio however the rate of such growth may be adversely affected by lower wireless carrier capital expenditures 

total cost of revenues increased 52 to 1521 million for 2002 from 1447 million for 2001 site development cost of revenue decreased 51 to 1025 million in 2002 from 1079 million in 2001 site development consulting cost of revenue increased 205 to 206 million for 2002 from 171 million for 2001 reflecting higher levels of activity and increased personnel costs site development construction cost of revenue decreased 99 to 819 million for 2002 from 908 million for 2001 due primarily to lower levels of activity site leasing cost of revenue increased 352 to 496 million for 2002 from 367 million for 2001 due to the increased number of towers owned resulting in an increased amount of lease payments to site owners and related site costs as well as increases in operating costs of sites in puerto rico maintenance and property taxes 

gross profit increased to 1126 million for 2002 from 982 million for 2001 due to increased site leasing gross profit offset by a decrease in site development gross profit gross profit from site development decreased 290 to 226 million in 2002 from 318 million in 2001 due to lower revenue and lower pricing without a commensurate reduction in cost gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2002 to 180 from 228 in 2001 gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to 243 for 2002 from 295 for 2001 this decrease reflects different stages of project completions and lower pricing for our services due to competition gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to 163 for 2002 from 213 in 2001 resulting from lower pricing due to increased competition we expect this pricing competition to continue and gross profit margin from site development to continue to be negatively impacted as we move through 2003 gross profit for the site leasing business increased 355 to 900 million in 2002 from 664 million in 2001 and the gross profit margins on site leasing remained consistent at 644 during 2002 and 2001 as a percentage of total revenues gross profit increased to 425 of total revenues in 2002 from 404 in 2001 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit 

selling general and administrative expenses decreased 139 to 356 million for 2002 from 413 million for 2001 selling general and administrative expenses net of noncash compensation expense as a percentage of total revenue has also decreased to 127 for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 157 for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in selling general and administrative expense primarily resulted from a decrease in tower developmental expenses as well as the reduction of offices elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure that had previously been necessary to support our prior level of new asset growth but is no longer required as a result of the restructuring previously discussed included within selling general and administrative expenses is a provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts increased to 26 million for the year ended december 31 2002 from 14 million for the year ended december 31 2001 reflecting our assessment of a more challenging financial environment for our customers in 2002 and beyond 

depreciation and amortization increased to 1023 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 805 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this increase is directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 2002 as compared to 2001 offset by a decrease in amortization resulting from the writeoff of goodwill which was recorded in connection with the implementation of sfas no 142 previously 

discussed amortization of covenants not to compete in 2002 was 14 million goodwill amortization was 0 compared to amortization of covenants not to compete and goodwill in 2001 of 69 million 

during the year ended december 31 2002 we incurred restructuring and other charges in the amount of 776 million consisting primarily of 637 million of restructuring charges and a 134 million goodwill impairment charge as a result of the continued deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers a 637 million restructuring charge was recorded due to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction activities and the impairment of certain tower assets held and used in operations of the 637 million charge approximately 404 million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately 764 sites and 164 million related to the impairment of approximately 144 tower sites held and used in operations the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process resulted in the full write off of all costs incurred to date the impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluation of the current projected cash flow and subsequent writedown to fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future leaseup the remaining 69 million of charge related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately 470 employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately 40 offices exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities 

operating loss was 1029 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to an operating loss of 480 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this increase in operating loss is a result of 776 million of restructuring and other charge recorded in the year ended december 31 2002 versus 244 recorded in the year ended december 31 2001 total other expenses increased to 893 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to 705 million for the year ended december 31 2001 primarily as a result of increased cash interest expense increased noncash amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs and a reduction in interest income the increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher principal amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility in 2002 as compared to 2001 and to a full quarter of interest expense on our 5000 million 10¼  senior notes in the first quarter of 2002 compared to a partial quarter of interest expense on these senior notes in the first quarter of 2001 although the aggregate principal amount of total debt increased from the prior year the resulting increase in interest expense associated with the higher principal in 2002 was offset by the interest rate reduction we recognized in connection with our interest rate swap agreement as the interest rate swap agreement was terminated during october 2002 our aggregate amount of interest expense would be expected to increase in future periods excluding however the impact of the aat transaction and the use of the proceeds to reduce our aggregate amount of outstanding indebtedness the increase in noncash amortization is primarily due to higher accretion on the 12 senior discount notes the decrease in interest income is due to lower cash balances during 2002 

during the period ended june 30 2002 we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas 142 which was adopted effective january 1 2002 as a result of completing the required transitional test we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of 806 million representing the excess of the carrying value of reporting units as compared to estimated fair value at january 1 2002 of the total 806 million cumulative effect adjustment 616 million related to the site development construction reporting segment and 190 million related to the site leasing reporting segment the change modified the first quarter’s previously reported net loss of 832 million or 170 per share to 1638 million or 334 per share 

during 2002 we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately 134 million resulting from the achievement of certain earnout obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july 1 2001 in accordance with sfas 142 in addition to the transitional test described above goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually or at any time that indicators of impairment are present we determined that as of june 30 2002 indicators of impairment were present thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed the indicators of impairment during the quarter ended june 30 2002 giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall company market value continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans related demand for wireless construction and perceived reduction in value of similar site development construction services business as a result of this analysis using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value 134 million of goodwill within the site development construction reporting unit was determined to be impaired as of june 30 2002 the 134 million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 

net loss was 2732 million for the year ended december 31 2002 as compared to net loss of 1251 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this increase in net loss is primarily a result of higher depreciation expense 

higher net interest expense the 776 million restructuring and other charges previously discussed and the 806 million cumulative effect of change in accounting principle previously discussed offset by higher gross profit and lower selling general and administrative expenses we expect to incur additional net losses in 2003 

earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses “ebitda” increased 311 to 790 million for the year ended 2002 from 602 million for the year ended 2001 if the aat transaction is consummated our ebitda in 2003 would be reduced as a result of the sale of either 679 or 801 towers the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda to net loss available to common shareholders 

 year ended 2001 compared to year ended 2000 

total revenues increased 447 to 2429 million for 2001 from 1679 million for 2000 total site development revenue increased 206 to 1397 million in 2001 from 1159 million in 2000 due to an increase in site development construction revenue site development construction revenue increased 260 to 1155 million for 2001 from 916 million for 2000 due primarily to revenues from companies acquired during 2000 and 2001 revenues of 343 million were contributed by these acquired entities in 2001 our decision to reduce our level of new tower development activity may have a material adverse effect on our site development revenue in 2002 since as a result we do not expect to perform equipment installation work for as many first tenants as we did in 2001 site development consulting revenues were 243 million for 2001 and 2000 site leasing revenue increased 983 to 1032 million for 2001 from 520 million for 2000 due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during 2001 as compared to 2000 

total cost of revenues increased 335 to 1447 million for 2001 from 1084 million for 2000 site development cost of revenue increased 214 to 1079 million in 2001 from 889 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues site development consulting cost of revenue increased 94 to 171 million for 2001 from 156 million for 2000 reflecting increased human resources costs site development construction cost of revenue increased 240 to 908 million for 2001 from 733 million for 2000 due to higher site development construction revenues site leasing cost of revenue increased 883 to 367 million for 2001 from 195 million for 2000 due primarily to the increased number of towers owned 

gross profit increased to 982 million for 2001 from 595 million for 2000 due to increased site development and site leasing revenues gross profit from site development increased 178 to 318 million in 2001 from 270 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2001 to 228 from 233 in 2000 due to a greater relative amount of lower margin site development construction business gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to 295 for 2001 from 356 for 2000 this decrease is attributable to higher costs and our inability to timely reduce those costs as projects ended gross profit margin on site development construction increased slightly to 213 for 2001 from 201 in 2000 gross profit for the site leasing business increased 1043 to 664 million in 2001 from 325 million in 2000 the increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2001 period the gross profit margins on site leasing increased to 644 for 2001 from 625 in 2000 the increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower which was greater 

than the increase in average expenses as a percentage of total revenues gross profit increased to 404 of total revenues in 2001 from 354 in 2000 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit 

selling general and administrative expenses increased 487 to 413 million for 2001 from 278 million for 2000 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses represents the addition of offices personnel and other infrastructure necessary to support our growth as well as increased developmental expenses associated with our higher levels of new tower builds and acquisition activities and an increase in noncash compensation expenses in 2001 included in selling general and administrative expense is noncash compensation expense of 33 million for 2001 and 03 million for 2000 the increase in 2001 is attributable primarily to the use of stock and options as payment for certain bonuses as a percentage of total revenue excluding noncash compensation expenses selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 157 for 2001 from 164 in 2000 

during the twelve months ended december 31 2001 we recorded a 244 million charge relating to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction operations approximately 241 million of this charge related to costs that were previously reflected in our balance sheet as constructioninprocess the remaining 03 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for 102 employees and the costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were primarily utilized in our new asset development activities 

depreciation and amortization increased to 805 million for 2001 as compared to 348 million for 2000 this increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 2001 as compared to 2000 as our fixed assets begin to mature we will be continuing to evaluate the useful lives of the assets and may decide to change these useful lives based on the circumstances if the useful lives of assets are reduced depreciation may be accelerated in future years amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2001 and 2000 was 69 million and 36 million respectively 

operating loss increased to 480 million for the year ended 2001 from 31 million in 2000 as a result of increased depreciation and the restructuring and other charge in 2001 other expense net increased to 705 million for the year ended 2001 from 246 million for the year ended 2000 this increase is a result of an increase in interest expense due to interest associated with the 10¼ senior notes as well as increases in other debt balances 

earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses “ebitda” increased 880 to 602 million for the year ended 2001 from 320 million for the year ended 2000 the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda to net loss available to common shareholders 

 liquidity and capital resources 

sba communications corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of sba telecommunications which owns directly or indirectly the capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend our ability to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures related to our 10¼ senior notes and 12 senior discount notes 

as a result of these estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility during 2003 the auditor’s opinion on our 2002 consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through 2003 

the issuance of this audit opinion with a “goingconcern” qualification if not remedied by april 30 2003 would itself be an event of default under our senior credit facility as part of our plan to address our anticipated noncompliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in 2003 and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications to sell 679 towers or if aat communications elects to purchase an additional 122 towers an aggregate of 801 towers the aat transaction is subject to various conditions including an amendment to our credit facility we anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would among other things 1 waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification 2 modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during 2003 and beyond and 3 permit certain activities that are part of the aat transaction we believe that the aat transaction in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility will upon consummation eliminate the issues that gave rise to the “going concern” qualification from our auditors based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers and the amendment to the senior credit facility we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow 

for a further discussion of our management’s plans to address the issuance of our audit opinion with a “going concern” qualification and the possible defaults of certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility please refer to the section entitled “going concern” above 

in addition to the proposed aat transaction in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to insure continued compliance with our financial covenants we are exploring a number of alternatives including selling certain assets or lines of business issuing equity repurchasing restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives one or more of the alternatives may include the possibility of issuing additional shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock or converting our existing indebtedness into shares of common stock or securities convertible into shares of common stock any of which would dilute our existing shareholders we cannot assure you that either the aat transaction andor any other of these strategies can be consummated or if consummated would effectively address our liquidity concerns the possible defaults under our debt instruments or any of the other risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2002 was 16 million as compared to 130 million in 2001 this decrease was primarily attributable to cash interest payments made in february and august 2002 on the 10¼ senior notes net cash used in investing activities for year the ended december 31 2002 was 980 million compared to 5303 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this decrease was primarily attributable to a significantly lower level of tower acquisitions and new build activity in 2002 versus 2001 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2002 was 1437 million compared to 5162 million for the year ended december 31 2001 the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in 2002 was primarily due to the issuance of our 5000 million 10¼ senior notes completed in february 2001 

our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2002 were 1034 million as compared to 5303 million for the year ended december 31 2001 this decrease is a result of lower investment in new tower assets we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year ending december 31 2003 of 100 million to 150 million all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and to complete pending buildtosuit obligations 

our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of 1490 million and 194 million as of december 31 2002 and 2001 respectively this change is attributable to the classification of 1894 million of previously longterm debt as current based upon management’s requirement to repay in 2003 substantially all of the net proceeds from the aat transaction in the amount of 1880 million offset by higher cash balances receipts of accounts receivable and lower accounts payable levels 

at december 31 2002 we had 5000 million outstanding on our 10¼ senior notes the 10¼ senior notes mature february 1 2009 interest on these notes is payable february 1 and august 1 of each year additionally at december 31 2002 we had 2639 million outstanding on our 12 senior discount notes net of unamortized original issue discount of 51 million the 12 senior discount notes mature on march 1 2008 the 12 senior 

discount notes accreted in value until march 1 2003 thereafter interest will begin to accrue and will be payable on march 1 and september 1 of each year commencing on september 1 2003 each of the 10¼ senior notes and the 12 senior discount notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness the 10¼ senior notes and the 12 senior discount notes place certain restrictions on among other things the incurrence of debt and liens issuance of preferred stock payment of dividends or other distributions sale of assets transactions with affiliates sale and leaseback transactions certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities 

in june 2001 sba telecommunications our principal subsidiary entered into a 3000 million senior secured credit facility this facility was amended in january 2002 and further amended in august 2002 the senior credit facility as amended provides for a 1000 million term loan and a 2000 million revolving loan the availability of which is based on compliance with certain covenants as of december 31 2002 sba telecommunications had 2550 million in loans outstanding under this facility 1000 million of the term loan and 1550 million of the revolver in addition as of december 31 2002 145 million of letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the senior credit facility the term loan and the revolving loan mature june 15 2007 and repayment of the term loan begins in september 2003 25 million is due for repayment on each of september 30 2003 and december 31 2003 under the current terms of the senior credit facility we are required to use substantially all of the net proceeds of asset sales to repay outstanding debt under the senior credit facility as a result we have calculated our current debt outstanding at december 31 2002 to include substantially all of the net proceeds from the proposed sale of 801 towers to aat communications of 1880 million however we intend to seek an amendment to the senior credit facility and in exchange for certain modifications we would repay approximately 1500 million of this facility in 2003 the receipt of this amendment is a condition to the consummation of the aat transaction borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue interest at the euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin as defined in the credit agreement at december 31 2002 1000 million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility was at variable rates of 341 to 343 and 1550 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility was at variable rates of 341 to 381 

the senior credit facility requires sba telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding our consolidated debt coverage debt service cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and to satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining minimum consolidated ebitda the senior credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants which among other things require us to submit audited financial statements without a “goingconcern” qualification in the audit opinion and restricts our ability to incur debt and liens sell assets commit to capital expenditures enter into affiliate transactions or saleleaseback transactions andor build towers without anchor tenants the august 2002 amendment adjusted certain covenants and financial covenants but did not change the amount or repayment terms of the facility specifically the august 2002 amendment 1 amended certain financial covenants to a decrease the required ratios for cash interest expense coverage fixed charges coverage and debt service coverage in 2003 to 2005 and b reduce the permitted senior leverage and debt per tower ratios and 2 increased the interest margin over the euro dollar rate as specified in the original agreement by 25 basis points availability under the senior credit facility is contingent upon compliance with the financial ratios and tests and other covenants in the credit agreement as of december 31 2002 we were in full compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility however the issuance of the audit opinion on the 2002 financial statements with a “goingconcern” qualification if not remedied by april 30 2003 would be an event of default which would permit the lenders by a majority vote to immediately accelerate the maturity of the principal and interest outstanding under the senior credit facility and to terminate our ability to access any remaining available funds our ability in the future to comply with the covenants and access the available funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on our future financial performance the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of sba telecommunications and its subsidiaries 

one of our goals is the attainment of sustained positive free cash flow 1  we define free cash flow as ebitda less net cash interest cash capital expenditures and cash taxes we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity until we reach our goal of sustained positive free cash flow based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either 679 or 801 towers and the amendment to the senior credit facility we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow

effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements 

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 143 accounting for asset retirement obligations this standard requires companies to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred when the liability is initially recorded the cost is to be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related longlived asset over time the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset upon settlement of the liability we either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement we are required to adopt this standard effective january 1 2003 we have not completed our analysis determining the effect adoption of sfas 143 will have on our consolidated financial statements but believe it may be material given that we have obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases underlying a majority of our towers we will record the cumulative effect of adopting this statement effective january 1 2003 

in april 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 145 rescission of fasb statements nos 4 44 and 62 amendment of sfas no 13 and technical corrections  for most companies sfas 145 will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas 4 extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in apb opinion no 30 the statement also amended sfas 13 for certain saleleasebacks and sublease accounting we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas 145 effective january 1 2003 pursuant to sfas 145 our previously reported extraordinary item will be reclassified to operating expense in consolidated financial statement presentation subsequent to december 31 2002 

in july 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 146 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullified eitf issue no 94–3 sfas 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred whereas eitf no 94–3 had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan sfas 146 requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas 146 effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december 31 2002 the effect of adopting sfas 146 is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements 

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 accounting for stockbased compensation—transition and disclosure  sfas 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas 123 to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2002 we will continue to account for stockbased compensation in accordance with apb no 25 as such we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations we have adopted the disclosureonly provisions of sfas no 148 as of december 31 2002 

in november 2002 the fasb issued fasb interpretation “fin” no 45 guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin 45 also clarifies requirements for the recognition of guarantees at the onset of an arrangement the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december 31 2002 the disclosure requirements of fin 45 are effective for interim or annual financial statements after december 15 2002 we implemented the disclosure requirements of fin 45 as of december 31 2002 and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of this implementation 

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation “fin” no 46 consideration for variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 51 which requires all variable interest entities “vies” to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the vie in addition the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is a holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests but not the majority fin 46 is effective for all vies created or acquired after january 31 2003 for vies created or acquired prior to february 1 2003 the provisions of fin 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june 15 2003 we do not expect the effect of adopting fin 46 to be material to the consolidated financial statements

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgment in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies see note 3 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k beginning on page f10 note that our preparation of this annual report on form 10k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straightline basis over the term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenues 

site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by us at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to our results of operations any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete 

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred cost of site leasing revenue include rent maintenance exclusive of employee related costs and other tower expenses provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 

property and equipment 

property and equipment are recorded at cost depreciation is provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset industry practice and asset maintenance policies maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 

asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows 

 capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life term 

we evaluate the potential impairment of individual longlived assets principally the tower sites we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment including but not limited to general market and economic conditions historical operating results geographic location leaseup potential and expected timing of leaseup future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future in addition if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect a future impairment charge may be required 

the restructuring and other charges of  776 million recorded in 2002 includes a 164 million asset impairment charge the asset impairment charge was determined through an evaluation of our tower asset portfolio using a projected cash flow analysis and assets were written down to fair value determined on a discounted cash flow analysis the tower assets determined to be impaired were primarily those with no current tenants and little or no leaseup potential longlived assets are subject to an impairment assessment any time that indicators of impairment are present if wireless carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remain weak or deteriorate further we believe the valuation of certain of our longlived assets may be negatively impacted 

in october 2001 the fasb issued sfas no 144 accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets  sfas 144 supercedes sfas no 121 accounting for the impairment of longlived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas 144 applies to all longlived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 30  reporting results of operations – reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  sfas 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december 15 2001 we adopted sfas 144 on january 1 2002 

goodwill 

during 2002 we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas 142 which was adopted effective january 1 2002 as a result of completing the required transitional test we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of 806 million representing the excess of the carrying value of reporting units as compared to their estimated fair value of the total 806 million cumulative effect adjustment 616 million related to the site development construction reporting segment and 190 million related to the site leasing reporting segment the change modified the first quarter’s previously reported net loss of 832 million or 170 per share to 1638 million or 334 per share 

during 2002 we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately 134 million resulting from the achievement of certain earnout obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july 1 2001 in accordance with sfas 142 in addition to the transitional test described above goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually or at any time that indicators of impairment are present we determined that as of june 30 2002 indicators of impairment were present thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed the indicators of impairment during the quarter ended june 30 2002 giving rise to this analysis included significant further deterioration of company value further activities under our restructuring plan and market conditions related to demand for wireless construction services as a result of this analysis using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value 134 million of goodwill within the site development construction segment was determined to be impaired as of june 30 2002 the 134 million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december 31 2002 as of december 31 2002 we did not have any remaining goodwill or other intangible assets subject to sfas 142 

restructuring accruals 

in establishing the accrual for the restructuring costs discussed in note 14 to the consolidated financial statements we made certain assumptions to estimate future severance costs and other exit costs in addition while performing impairment tests for certain longterm assets assumptions were made as to the future cash flows associated with these assets while we feel the assumptions were appropriate there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring accrual if actual results differ from the estimates we may need to adjust upward or downward our restructuring accrual in the future 

accounting for income taxes 

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheets we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance of 1362 million as of december 31 2002 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating losses the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations the net deferred tax liability as of december 31 2002 was 184 million 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and in some cases relate to our acquisition of related businesses we are subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility and any future financing requirements substantially of our indebtedness currently consists of fixed rate debt 

the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our longterm debt instruments assuming our actual level of longterm indebtedness as of december 31 2002 

 in january 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap was 1000 million the maturity date of the interest rate swap matched the principal maturity date of the 10¼ senior notes the underlying debt february 2009 this swap involved the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the variable rates were based on sixmonth euro rate plus 447 and were reset on a semiannual basis the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreement elected to terminate the swap agreement effective october 15 2002 in connection with this termination the counterparty paid us 62 million which included approximately 08 million in accrued interest the remaining 54 million received was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes using the effective interest method the deferred gain balance of 52 million at december 31 2002 is included in longterm debt 

our primary market risk exposure relates to 1 the interest rate risk on variablerate longterm and shortterm borrowings 2 our ability to refinance our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes at maturity at market rates and 3 the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet financial covenants we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding longterm and shortterm debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 

senior discount note disclosure requirements 

the indentures governing our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of tower cash flow as defined in the indentures for the most recent fiscal quarter and adjusted consolidated cash flow as defined in the indentures for the most recently completed fourquarter period as of december 31 2002 we had no unrestricted subsidiaries tower cash flow as defined in the indentures for the quarter ended december 31 2002 was 189 million adjusted consolidated cash flow for the year ended december 31 2002 was 822 million

 item i business 

  

general 

  

we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the united states and puerto rico we generate revenues from our two primary businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others the towers that we own have either been built by us at the request of a wireless carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative as of december 31 2001 we owned or controlled 3734 towers we expect to build or acquire approximately 250 to 350 towers during 2002 in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing their own networks including designing a network with signal coverage identifying and acquiring locations to place their antennas and transmission equipment obtaining zoning approvals building towers when necessary and installing their antennas and transmission equipment since our founding in 1989 we have participated in the development of more than 15000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major wireless markets in the united states 

  

company services 

  

we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices territory offices and project offices which are opened and closed on a project by project basis operationally we are divided into regions throughout the united states run by regional vice presidents each region is divided into subregions run by general managers and we have further divided each subregion into geographic territories run by territory managers within each territory manager’s geographic area of responsibility he or she is responsible for all operations including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of the sales in such area 

  

our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources legal and regulatory information technology departments site administration personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters in boca raton florida we also have in our boca raton office certain sales new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel 

  

site leasing services 

  

in 1997 we began aggressively expanding our site leasing business by capitalizing on our nationally recognized site development experience and strong relationships with wireless service providers to take advantage of the trends toward colocation which is the placement of multiple antennas on one tower or other structure and independent tower ownership we believe our towers have significant capacity to accommodate additional tenants with minimal incremental costs additionally due to the relatively young age and mix of our tower portfolio we believe future expenditures required to maintain these towers will be minimal 

  

the following chart shows the number of towers we built for our own account the number of towers we acquired and the number of tenants at year end on our towers for the periods indicated 

  

 

  tableend  

  

we expect the rate of tower additions to the portfolio to decline in 2002 compared to prior periods 

  

the following table indicates the number of our acquired and built towers based on location as of december 31 2001 

  

 

  

  

we believe our history and experience in providing site development services gives us a competitive advantage in choosing the most attractive locations on which to build new towers or buy existing towers as measured by our success in increasing tower revenues and cash flows our same tower revenue growth and same tower cash flow growth at december 31 2001 on the 2390 towers we owned as of december 31 2000 was 24 and 29 respectively based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

our site leasing revenue comes from a variety of wireless carriers including att wireless cingular nextel sprint pcs verizon and voicestream site leasing revenue was 1032 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 520 million for the year ended december 31 2000 we believe that our site leasing revenues will continue to grow as wireless service providers continue to lease antenna space on our towers 

  

our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under longterm lease contracts we lease antenna space on 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

a significant number of our towers were built under our buildtosuit program through which we built towers for a wireless service provider on a location of their direction we retained ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower many wireless service providers chose the buildtosuit option as an alternative to owning the towers themselves our buildtosuit sites came from a variety of wireless carriers including alamosa pcs att wireless cingular horizon pcs sprint pcs telecorp pcs triton pcs and voicestream 

  

to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment in the towers we own we have begun to provide services at our tower locations beyond the leasing of antenna space these services which we provide or may provide in the future include generator provisioning antenna installation equipment installation and backhaul which is the transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by an antenna to a carrier’s network some of these services are recurring in nature and are contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the way they lease antenna space 

  

site development services 

  

our site development business consists of two segments site development consulting and site development construction through which we provide wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the following services 1 network predesign 2 site audits 3 identification of potential locations for towers and antennas 4 support in buying or leasing of the location and 5 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of services including the following 1 tower and related site construction 2 switch building construction 3 antenna installation and 4 radio equipment installation commissioning and service we will continue to use our site development expertise to complement our site leasing business we have capitalized on our leadership position in the site development business and our strong relationships with wireless service providers to build and acquire towers in locations that we believe are attractive to wireless service providers 

  

our site development customers currently comprise many of the major wireless communications companies including att wireless cingular nextel sprint pcs verizon and voicestream site development revenue was 1397 million for the year ended december 31 2001 and 1159 million for the year ended december 31 2000 

  

business strategy 

  

our primary strategy is to capture the maximum benefits from our position as a leading owner and operator of wireless communications towers and expand our position as a leading provider of site development services key elements of our strategy include 

  

maximizing use of tower capacity we believe that many of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennae and that increased use of our owned towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we generally have constructed our towers to accommodate multiple tenants in addition to the anchor tenant and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity lattice or guyed towers we actively market space on our own towers through our internal sales force 

  

capturing other revenues that flow from our tower ownership tenants who lease antenna space on our towers need a variety of additional services in connection with their operations at the tower site these services include installation maintenance and upgrading of radio transmission equipment antennas cabling and other connection equipment electricity backhaul which is provided generally by telephone lines or a microwave antenna network equipment shelters data collection and network monitoring tenants often outsource the performance of some or all of these required services to third parties including us because of our ownership of the tower our control of the tower site and our experience and capabilities in providing these types of services we believe that we are well positioned and intend to perform more of these services and capture the related revenue 

  

maintaining our expertise in site development services we continue to perform an array of site development services for wireless service and other telecommunications providers across the united states we have a broad national field organization that allows us to identify and participate in site development projects across the country and that gives us a knowledge of local markets and strong customer relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications providers we believe our site development experience provides us with a competitive advantage in selecting the best locations for tower ownership 

  

executing on a local basis we believe that substantially all of what we do is best done locally given the nature of towers as location specific communications facilities we believe our customers make decisions locally we believe that to be successful in tower building acquisition and leasing and site acquisition zoning and construction we must have a strong local presence in the markets we serve 

  

capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development services management believes that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site development services 

  

building on strong relationships with major wireless service providers we are wellpositioned to be a preferred partner in site development projects and tower space leasing because of our strong relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications providers and our proven operating experience 

  

customers 

  

since commencing operations we have performed site leasing and site development services for many of the largest wireless service providers the majority of our contracts have been for pcs broadband esmr and cellular customers we also serve wireless data and internet paging pcs narrowband smr multichannel multipoint distribution service or mmds and multipoint distribution service or mds wireless providers in both our site development and site leasing businesses we work with large national providers and smaller local regional or private operators for the year ended december 31 2001 nextel provided 116 sprint pcs provided 115 and bechtel corporation contractor for att wireless provided 109 of our site development revenues in 2000 sprint pcs provided 108 and alamosa provided 110 of our site development revenue for the year ended december 31 2001 nextel provided 104 of our site leasing revenues in 2000 nextel provided 106 and sprint pcs provided 103 of our site leasing revenues no other customer represented more than 10 of our site leasing or site development revenues 

  

during the past two years we provided services for a number of customers including 

  

 

  

sales and marketing 

  

our sales and marketing goals are 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees we have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional vice presidents general managers territory managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with the wireless service providers most wireless service providers have national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices we believe that providers at the regional and local levels make most decisions for site development and site leasing services with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives work with provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations personnel have salesbased incentive components in their compensation plans 

  

in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and operations personnel on the regional and territory office levels to identify sales opportunities within existing customer accounts 

  

our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing efforts the marketing and sales support staff are charged with implementing our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation materials and proposals 

  

competition 

  

we compete with 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and capacity quality of service density within a geographic market and to a lesser extent price historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  

our primary competitors for our site leasing activities are the four large public tower companies american tower corporation crown castle international corp pinnacle holdings inc and spectrasite holdings inc in addition we compete with att wireless services and with sprint pcs who currently market excess space on their owned towers to other wireless service providers 

  

we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms appear to offer their services nationally including american tower corporation bechtel black  veach general dynamics mastec mericom and spectrasite holdings inc the market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing services the field of competitors includes site development consultants zoning consultants real estate firms rightofway consulting firms construction companies tower ownersmanagers radio frequency engineering consultants telecommunications equipment vendors which provide endtoend site development services through multiple subcontractors and providers’ internal staff we believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria including a company’s experience track record local reputation price and time for completion of a project we believe that we compete favorably in these areas 

  

employees 

  

as of december 31 2001 we had approximately 1350 employees none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining agreement we consider our employee relations to be good in february 2002 we announced that in connection with our plan to significantly reduce our tower acquisition and new build programs we would be closing certain offices and reducing personnel as of march 1 2002 we had approximately 1100 employees as a result of this reduction and the number is expected to be further reduced through the remainder of 2002 

  

regulatory and environmental matters 

  

federal regulations both the federal communications commission “fcc” and the federal aviation administration “faa” regulate towers used for wireless communications these regulations govern the construction and marking and painting of towers and may depending on the characteristics of particular towers require prior approval and registration of towers wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency or frequency band used 

  

pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 as amended the fcc in conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals for new or modified towers these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa consider the height of proposed tower structures the relationship of the structure to existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the towers to runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing towers above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will not present a hazard to air navigation the faa may condition its issuance of a nohazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting marking andor painting requirements towers that meet certain height and location criteria must also be registered with the fcc a tower that requires faa clearance will not be registered by the fcc until it is cleared by the faa upon registration the fcc may also require special lighting marking andor painting requirements owners of wireless transmission towers may have an obligation to maintain marking painting and lighting to conform to faa and fcc standards tower owners also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage or malfunction in addition any applicant for an fcc antenna structure registration must certify that consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled substance we generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties 

  

the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the construction modification and placement of towers the new law however limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would 1 discriminate between different providers of personal wireless services or 2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities 

  

owners and operators of towers may be subject to and therefore must comply with environmental laws any licensed radio facility on a tower is subject to environmental review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of their decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place responsibility on each applicant to investigate any potential environmental effects of operations and to disclose any potential significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing a tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed tower would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental assessment which will be subject to public comment this process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower 

  

as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property damage we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of towers must also take into consideration certain rf emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements the potential connection between rf emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years we believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

  

state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition and leasing activities and construction activities where required we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers agents who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors and conduct the construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors who may be our employees or independent contractors local regulations include city and other local 

ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new transmission towers in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers and have in some instances instituted moratoria 

  

recent developments 

  

in august 2001 we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction plan and operation to produce 100 to 150 new towers per quarter commencing with the third quarter of 2001 instead of the 200 to 250 new towers per quarter previously built or capable of being built by us at that time we expected to build a total of approximately 600 to 700 new towers in 2001 and approximately 400 to 600 in 2002 in connection with this adjustment we recorded a 244 million charge in the third quarter of 2001 included in this charge was a writeoff of costs previously reflected on our balance sheet as constructioninprocess for certain new tower build sites for which development activity had been abandoned costs of employee separation for certain employees and costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were previously utilized primarily in our new tower development activities 

  

in february 2002 we announced that as a result of capital market conditions we were further reducing our planned capital expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers we have reduced the number of towers expected to be built or acquired in 2002 to approximately 250 to 350 towers we expect approximately 90 to 110 new towers to be built or acquired in the first quarter of 2002 and the remainder of our obligations to build or acquire towers to be satisfied later in 2002 under current capital markets conditions we do not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we are currently contractually obligated to build or buy in connection with this restructuring plan we anticipate incurring charges of between 300 million and 650 million related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition constructioninprocess costs of employee separation costs associated with the closing of offices and other items the amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of costs of constructioninprocess with respect to those new builds we choose to dispose of most of this charge is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2002 with the remainder incurred in the second quarter of 2002 

  

in the first quarter of 2002 we are required to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets  “sfas 142” with the adoption of sfas 142 we will assess the impairment if any on goodwill and certain other intangible assets in lieu of amortization against earnings we are currently performing that assessment and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas 142 will have on our consolidated financial statements however we believe the impact may be material as of december 31 2001 we had unamortized goodwill and covenants not to compete of 862 million 

  

backlog 

  

our backlog for site development services was 588 million as of december 31 2001 as compared to 610 million as of december 31 2000 our backlog for pending tower acquisitions was 145 towers as of december 31 2001 as compared to 677 towers as of december 31 2000 we were pursuing buildtosuit mandates for approximately 400 towers as of december 31 2001 as compared to 600 as of december 31 2000 as a result of actions we have taken in connection with our announced reduction of capital expenditures for new tower assets our backlog of tower acquisitions and towers under buildtosuit mandates has been materially reduced during the first quarter of 2002 we expect to acquire 40 to 50 towers we do not anticipate having any material amount of pending tower acquisitions in our backlog as of march 31 2002 we expect to build 60 to 70 towers during the first quarter of 2002 and to have buildtosuit mandates for approximately 160 towers in our backlog as of march 31 2002 we anticipate that we will perform all of these services and complete the pending tower acquisitions during the current fiscal year 

  

risk factors 

  

we may not be able to service our substantial indebtedness 

  

as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness relative to our equity size 

  

 

  

our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you for example it could 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance based on our outstanding debt as of december 31 2001 we would require approximately 568 million of cash flow from operations before net cash interest expenses to discharge our cash interest obligations for the twelve months ending december 31 2002 by comparison for the twelve months ended december 31 2001 we generated 537 million of cash flow from operations before net cash interest expenses as we borrow under our senior credit facility the amount of cash flow needed to fund our cash interest obligations will increase this amount will increase materially in september 2003 once we begin to pay cash interest on our 12 senior discount notes and begin to amortize our 1000 million term loan under our senior credit facility 50 million of which is required to be repaid in 2003 if we do not materially increase our cash flow by then we will not be able to meet our obligations in order to manage our substantial amount of indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity or repurchase restructure or refinance some or all of our debt we may not be able to effect any of these alternative strategies on satisfactory terms if at all the implementation of any of these alternative strategies may dilute our current shareholders subject us to additional costs or restrictions on our ability to manage our business and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and growth strategy 

  

we pay interest on amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility at variable interest rates in addition we have entered and may in the future enter into interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates therefore if interest rates were to increase the amount of interest that we would have to pay would increase 

  

our cash flow is negative and we need to access external sources of liquidity to fund tower development activities 

  

during 2001 we did not generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to fund our cash expenditures and we expect this situation to continue until early 2003 therefore our ability to continue operating at our current level of activity is contingent upon receiving external sources of funding based on current capital market 

conditions we may not be able to access either the debt or equity markets on commercially reasonable terms or at all consequently we believe that the only likely material source of liquidity to fund our cash flow gap in 2002 and through early 2003 will be availability under our senior credit facility at december 31 2001 we had approximately 1900 million of funds available to us under our senior credit facility in september 2003 we begin paying cash interest on our 12 senior discount notes and begin making principal payments on our term loan under our senior credit facility to make such payments we may rely in part on availability under our senior credit facility even assuming that we have materially increased our cash flow from operations by that time if we are unable to borrow sufficient funds under our senior credit facility and we are unable to access other sources of funding we may not be able to satisfy our obligations and may be required to reduce our levels of business activity sell assets andor restructure or refinance our debt availability under our senior credit facility is subject to various risks including our compliance with the covenants specified in the senior credit facility agreement and compliance by the lenders with their financial commitment 

  

our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely affect our business 

  

our senior credit facility and the indentures governing our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes each contain certain restrictive covenants among other things these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness sell assets for less than fair market value pay dividends redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments if we fail to comply with these covenants it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments 

  

sba telecommunications inc our principal subsidiary which owns all of the common stock of our other subsidiaries is the borrower under our senior credit facility the senior credit facility requires sba telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios including ratios regarding sba telecommunications’ consolidated debt coverage debt service interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to meet these tests a breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under the senior credit facility if an event of default occurs our lenders can prevent us from borrowing additional amounts in addition upon the occurrence of any event of default other than certain bankruptcy events our senior credit facility lenders can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility together with all accrued interest to be immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy events the outstanding principal together with all accrued interest will automatically become immediately due and payable the occurrence of any event of default under our senior credit facility may cause a crossdefault in our 10¼ senior notes our 12 senior discount notes andor any of our other indebtedness and may permit the acceleration of some or all of our indebtedness if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility andor indebtedness under our 10¼ senior notes or 12 senior discount notes were to be accelerated our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness if we were unable to repay amounts that become due under the senior credit facility our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility 

  

we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned 

  

if tenant demand for tower space decreases we may not be able to successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse effect on our strategy revenue growth and our ability to satisfy our obligations our plan for the growth of our site leasing business largely depends on our management’s expectations and assumptions concerning future tenant demand for independentlyowned towers tenant demand includes both the number of tenants and the lease rates they are willing to pay 

  

wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and several of the independent tower companies generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than we do we believe that 

tower location and capacity price quality of service and density within a geographic market historically have been and will continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site leasing business 

  

demand for antennae space on communication sites may be adversely affected by consolidation of our wireless service provider customers economic conditions have resulted in the consolidation of several wireless service providers and this trend is likely to continue to the extent that our customers consolidate they may terminate any duplicative leases that they have on our towers andor may not lease as many spaces on our towers in the future this would adversely affect our growth our revenue and our ability to generate positive cash flow 

  

wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming agreements with competitors allowing them to use another’s wireless communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of their home provider’s services wireless voice service providers may view these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on communications sites owned or controlled by us the proliferation of these roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  

we may be adversely affected by an economic slowdown 

  

the significant general slowdown in the us economy has negatively affected 1 the financial condition of wireless service providers 2 the availability of capital and the willingness of wireless service providers to utilize capital to expand their networks and 3 may negatively affect the growth rate of consumer demand for wireless services as a result of the economic slowdown and the negative impact of such slowdown on the debt and equity markets we have adjusted our business to significantly reduce the number of new towers added to our portfolio in august 2001 we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction plan and operation to produce 100 to 150 new towers per quarter commencing with the third quarter of 2001 instead of the 200 to 250 new towers per quarter previously built or capable of being built by us in february 2002 we announced that we were further reducing our capital expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers if the us economy continues to suffer from the economic slowdown or if the economy worsens these factors could result in a material decrease in the demand for our tower space and our site development services 

  

we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses 

  

we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred for the periods indicated 

  

 

  

our losses are principally due to significant interest expense depreciation amortization and in the year 2001 a restructuring and other charge of 244 million we expect to continue to have significant interest expense and depreciation charges in 2002 in addition during 2002 we will incur a restructuring charge of 300 million to 650 million we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 

  

if demand for wireless communication services decreases our revenue will be adversely affected 

  

substantially all of our customers to date have been providers of wireless communications services if demand for wireless communication services decreases our revenue growth will be and our revenue may be adversely affected this could affect our ability to satisfy our obligations demand for both our site leasing and site development services is dependent on demand for communication sites from wireless service providers which in turn is dependent on the demand for wireless services a slowdown in the growth of or reduction in 

demand in a particular wireless communication segment could adversely affect the demand for communication sites most types of wireless services currently require groundbased network facilities including communication sites for transmission and reception the extent to which wireless service providers lease these communication sites depends on a number of factors beyond our control including 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue 

  

we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of customers that vary at any given time particularly in the site development services side of our business the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue 

  

following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of total revenues derived from such customers 

  

 

  

  

revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts and site development contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years with five 5year renewable options our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty in addition a customer’s need for site development services can decrease and we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers moreover our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional projects 

  

due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower industry is very sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants wireless service providers often operate with substantial leverage and financial problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable in the loss of customers and the associated lease revenues or in a reduced ability of these customers to finance expansion activities during the past two years a number of our site leasing customers have filed for bankruptcy including almost all of our paging customers although these bankruptcies have not yet had a material adverse effect on our business or revenues pending bankruptcies and any future bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our business or revenues 

  

new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations 

  

the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our towers this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and results of operations for example the fcc has granted license applications for several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide mobile voice and data services although these systems are highly capital intensive and have only begun to be tested mobile satellite 

systems could compete with landbased wireless communications systems in addition products are currently being developed which may permit multiple wireless carriers to use a single antenna to share networks or to increase the range and capacity of an antenna which if successful could reduce the number of antenna needed by our customers 

  

we may not be able to materially increase our tower assets without additional financing 

  

our ability to materially increase the size of our tower portfolio through cash expenditures depends on the availability of additional financing as we do not expect to generate material amounts of excess cash flow from our operations for at least the next two years based on current capital market conditions we have announced our intent to significantly scale back our tower acquisitions buildtosuit program and strategic siting programs we do not expect to recommence these programs until such time if ever that capital is available to us on terms we find acceptable if we are not able to increase the size of our tower portfolio it may materially adversely affect our longterm growth rates 

  

our quarterly operating results fluctuate and therefore should not be considered indicative of our longterm results 

  

the number of towers we build or acquire the number of tenants we add to our towers and the demand for our site development services fluctuate from quarter to quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results numerous factors cause these fluctuations including 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

 

  

although the demand for our services fluctuates we incur significant fixed costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future contracts the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales cycle may be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments budgetary cycles and pressures and general economic conditions in addition under lease terms typical in the tower industry revenue generated by new tenant leases usually commences upon installation of the tenant’s equipment on the tower rather than upon execution of the lease which can be 90 days or more after the execution of the lease 

  

our business is subject to government regulations and changes in current or future regulations could harm our business 

  

we are subject to federal state and local regulation of our business both the fcc and the faa regulate towers used for wireless communications and radio and television antennae in addition the fcc separately licenses and regulates wireless communication devices and television and radio stations operating from towers such regulations control construction lighting painting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of the tower require registration of tower facilities certain proposals to construct new towers or to modify existing towers are reviewed by the faa to ensure that the tower will not present a hazard to air navigation tower owners 

may have an obligation to mark or paint towers or install lighting to conform to faa standards and to maintain such marking painting and lighting tower owners may also bear the responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting failures failure to comply with existing or future applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties or other liabilities and may subject us to significant indemnification liability to our customers against any such failure to comply in addition new regulations may impose additional costly burdens on us which may affect our revenues and cause delays in our growth 

  

local regulations including municipal or local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community developers vary greatly but typically require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations prior to tower construction local regulations can delay or prevent new tower construction or site upgrade projects thereby limiting our ability to respond to customer demand in addition such regulations increase costs associated with new tower construction or upgrade projects at our existing tower sites we cannot assure you that existing regulatory policies will not adversely affect the timing or cost of new tower construction or upgrades or that additional regulations will not be adopted that increase such delays or result in additional costs to us such factors could have a material adverse effect on our future growth 

  

our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters 

  

our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are subject to caps and deductibles we also maintain third party liability insurance to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a tower or group of towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and may have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 

  

steven e bernstein controls the outcome of shareholder votes and therefore disinterested shareholders will not control many corporate governance matters 

  

steven e bernstein our chairman of the board controls 100 of the outstanding shares of class b common stock our class b common stock has the right to 10 votes for each share provided that the outstanding shares of class b common stock represent more than 10 of the aggregate amount of class a and class b common stock outstanding as of march 15 2002 the class b common stock represented 112 of the aggregate amount of common stock outstanding as of march 15 2002 mr bernstein controlled approximately 57 of the total voting power of both classes of our common stock as a result mr bernstein has the ability to control the outcome of all matters determined by a majority vote of our common shareholders when voting together as a single class consequently disinterested shareholders will not be able to determine who is elected as a director nor the outcome of other corporate governance matters subject to approval by the majority of the outstanding shares 

  

the loss of the services of certain of our executive officers may negatively affect our business 

  

our success depends to a significant extent upon performance and active participation of our key senior executives we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining the services of these key senior executives although we have an employment agreement with jeffrey a stoops our president and chief executive officer we do not have employment agreements with many of our other key senior executives if we were to lose any of the key senior executives we may not be able to find appropriate replacements on a timely basis and our results of operations could be negatively affected 

  

if we are unable to attract retain or manage skilled employees it could have a material adverse effect on our business 

  

our business particularly site development services involves the delivery of professional services and is laborintensive the loss of a significant number of employees our inability to hire a sufficient number of 

qualified employees or adequately develop and motivate the skilled employees we have hired could have a material adverse effect on our business we compete with other wireless communications firms and other enterprises for employees with the skills required to perform our services we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of highlyskilled employees in the future or that we will continue to be successful in training retaining and motivating employees 

  

our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our business 

  

we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may have a material adverse effect on our operations our only significant asset is and is expected to be the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow we currently expect that the earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them in their operations including servicing their debt obligations except as necessary to be distributed to us to cover holding company expenses including interest payments on our 10¼ senior notes and 12 senior discount notes even if our subsidiaries determined to make a distribution to us applicable state law and contractual restrictions including dividend covenants contained in our senior credit facility may restrict or prohibit these dividends or distributions 

  

we may experience volatility in our stock price that could affect the value of your investment 

  

the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for the common stock of companies in the past certain broad market fluctuations have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies any significant fluctuations in the future might result in a material decline in the market price of our class a common stock 

  

we have adopted antitakeover provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 

  

provisions of our articles of incorporation our bylaws and florida law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders we recently adopted a shareholder rights agreement which could make it considerably more difficult or costly for a person or group to acquire control of us in a transaction that our board of directors opposes these provisions alone or in combination with each other may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to holders of our class a common stock or could limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 

  

our costs could increase and our revenues could decrease due to perceived health risks from radio emissions especially if such emissions are demonstrated to cause negative health effects 

  

the government imposes requirements and other guidelines on our towers relating to radio emissions the potential connection between radio emissions and certain negative health effects including some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies have been inconclusive however public perception of possible health risks associated with cellular and other wireless communications media could slow the growth of wireless companies which could in turn slow our growth in particular negative public perception of and regulations regarding these perceived health risks could slow the market acceptance of wireless communications services 

  

if a connection between radio emissions and possible negative health effects including cancer were demonstrated we could be subject to numerous claims if we were subject to numerous claims relating to radio emissions even if such claims were not ultimately found to have merit our operations costs and revenues would be materially and adversely affected 

  

future issuances of our stock may cause dilution 

  

in connection with our financing and tower acquisition programs we have agreed and in the future may agree to issue material amounts of our class a common stock which could cause dilution to our current shareholders as of december 31 2001 we had the obligation to issue shares of class a common stock for an amount up to 50 million if the towers that we have acquired meet or exceed certain earnings or new tower targets identified in the various acquisition agreements in addition we may have up to an aggregate of 214 million in additional earnout obligations that may be paid in cash or shares of class a common stock at our option if the businesses acquired meet or exceed the agreed earnings or new tower targets 

  










 item 2 properties 

  

we are headquartered in boca raton florida where we currently lease approximately 73000 square feet of space we have entered into longterm leases for regional and certain site development office locations where we expect our activities to be longerterm we open and close project offices from time to time in connection with our site development business and offices for new tower build projects are generally leased for periods not to exceed 18 months our interests in towers are comprised of a variety of fee interests leasehold interests created by longterm lease agreements private easements easements and licenses or rightsofway granted by government entities please refer to “site leasing services” for a listing of the locations of towers 

  




 item 3 legal proceedings 

  

from time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings relating to claims arising in the ordinary course of business we are not a party to any legal proceeding the adverse outcome of which individually or taken together with all other legal proceedings is expected to have a material adverse effect on our prospects financial condition or results of operations 

  




 item 4 submission of matters to a vote of security holders 

  

no matter was submitted to the vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  

we are a leading independent owner and operator of over 3700 wireless communications towers in the united states and puerto rico we generate revenues from our two primary businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for others the towers that we own have either been constructed by us at the request of a carrier built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired in our site development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own networks 

  

we are continuing to shift our revenue stream from project driven revenues more to recurring revenues through the leasing of antenna space at or on communications facilities we intend to emphasize our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites and we believe we have well positioned ourselves to perform many of the other types of services that wireless service providers need in connection with the operation and maintenance of a wireless telecommunications network those services include installation maintenance and 

upgrading of radio transmission equipment antennas cabling and other connection equipment electricity backhaul equipment shelters data collection and network monitoring 

  

site leasing services 

  

site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts each site leasing contract relates to the lease of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of 5 years with five 5year renewable options almost all of our leases contain specified rent escalators which average 4 per year including the option periods leases are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in other liabilities current and longterm 

  

cost of site leasing revenue consist of 

     

  

for any given tower such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period as such operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as additional customers are added 

  

our same tower revenue growth and same tower cash flow growth at december 31 2001 on the 2390 towers we owned as of december 31 2000 was 24 and 29 respectively based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of december 31 2001 and 2000 

  

site development services 

  

site development services revenues are also received primarily from wireless communications companies our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price or milestone basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis we bill the client and recognize revenue based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis we recognize the revenue related to that phase the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed basis our site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the average site development contract for consulting was approximately 233000 per contract in 2001 and for construction was approximately 45000 per contract in 2001 revenue from our site development business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients’ capital expenditures the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period weather and other factors 

  

cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 

  

we have focused our capital expenditures on building new towers and acquiring existing towers and related businesses our average construction cost of a new tower is currently approximately 275000 while we believe the industry’s average acquisition cost of a tower over the last two years has been approximately 350000 as a result of these favorable economics we have historically elected to build the majority 59 of our towers however this trend changed somewhat in 2001 as the average acquisition price per tower declined we acquired more towers than we built in the year 2001 

  

while we have focused primarily on building new towers for growth we have also acquired 1525 towers as of december 31 2001 our acquisition strategy has focused on smaller acquisition opportunities from noncarriers and small carrier transactions we seek to acquire towers where we can increase cash flow to substantially reduce the tower cash flow multiple paid at acquisition through additional tenant lease up during the year ended december 31 2001 we acquired 677 towers the 677 tower acquisitions were completed at an aggregate purchase price of 2225 million exclusive of acquisition costs an average price of approximately 329000 per tower 

  

in august 2001 we announced that we were adjusting our new tower build construction plan and operation to produce fewer towers per quarter in connection with this adjustment we recorded a 244 million charge in the third quarter of 2001 included in this charge was a writeoff of costs previously reflected on our balance sheet as constructioninprocess for certain new tower build sites for which development activity had been abandoned costs of employee separation for certain employees and costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were previously utilized primarily in our new asset development activities 

  

in february 2002 we announced that as a result of capital market conditions we were further reducing our planned capital expenditures for new tower development activities in 2002 and subsequently suspending any material new investment for additional towers we have reduced the number of towers expected to be built or acquired in 2002 to approximately 250 to 350 towers under current capital market conditions we do not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we are currently contractually obligated to build or buy in connection with this restructuring plan we anticipate incurring charges of between 300 million and 650 million related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition constructioninprocess costs of employee separation costs associated with the closing of offices and other items the amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of costs of constructioninprocess with respect to those new builds we choose to dispose of most of the charge is expected to be incurred in the first quarter of 2002 with the remainder incurred in the second quarter of 2002 

  

we believe that if the capital markets conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry wireless service providers will choose to conserve capital and may not spend as many dollars as currently anticipated we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business may vary in response to the capital markets short term variable capital markets conditions may impact carrier demand for our tower space we believe that over the longer term however site leasing revenues will continue to increase as carriers continue to deploy new antenna sites to address issues of network capacity and quality increasing the recurring revenue stream we enjoy from existing tenants

as we continue to shift our revenue mix more towards site leasing operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results we expect that the acquisitions consummated to date and any future acquisitions as well as our new tower builds will have a material impact on future revenues expenses and net loss revenues cost of revenues selling general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest income and interest expense each increased significantly in the year ended december 31 2001 as compared to 2000 and some or all of those items may continue to increase significantly in future periods 

  

year ended 2001 compared to year ended 2000 

  

total revenues increased 447 to 2429 million for 2001 from 1679 million for 2000 total site development revenue increased 206 to 1397 million in 2001 from 1159 million in 2000 due to an increase in site development construction revenue site development construction revenue increased 260 to 1155 million for 2001 from 916 million for 2000 due primarily to revenues from companies acquired during 2000 and 2001 revenues of 343 million were contributed by these acquired entities in 2001 our decision to reduce our level of new tower development activity may have a material adverse effect on our site development revenue in 2002 since as a result we do not expect to perform equipment installation work for as many first tenants as we did in 2001 site development consulting revenues were 243 million for 2001 and 2000 site leasing revenue increased 983 to 1032 million for 2001 from 520 million for 2000 due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during 2001 as compared to 2000 

  

total cost of revenues increased 335 to 1447 million for 2001 from 1084 million for 2000 site development cost of revenue increased 214 to 1079 million in 2001 from 889 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues site development consulting cost of revenue increased 94 to 171 million for 2001 from 156 million for 2000 reflecting increased human resources costs site development construction cost of revenue increased 240 to 908 million for 2001 from 733 million for 2000 due to higher site development construction revenues site leasing cost of revenue increased 883 to 367 million for 2001 from 195 million for 2000 due primarily to the increased number of towers owned 

  

gross profit increased to 982 million for 2001 from 595 million for 2000 due to increased site development and site leasing revenues gross profit from site development increased 178 to 318 million in 2001 from 270 million in 2000 due to higher site development revenues gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2001 to 228 from 233 in 2000 due to a greater relative amount of lower margin site development construction business gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to 295 for 2001 from 356 for 2000 this decrease is attributable to higher costs and our inability to timely reduce those costs as projects ended gross profit margin on site development construction increased slightly to 213 for 2001 from 201 in 2000 with the expected loss of installation revenues discussed above and increased competition we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain gross profit margins in this range and we expect site development gross profit margins to settle in the 16 to 19 range as we move through 2002 gross profit for the site leasing business increased 1043 to 664 million in 2001 from 325 million in 2000 the increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2001 period the gross profit margins on site leasing increased to 644 for 2001 from 625 in 2000 the increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower which was greater than the increase in average expenses as a percentage of total revenues gross profit increased to 404 of total revenues in 2001 from 354 in 2000 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 487 to 413 million for 2001 from 278 million for 2000 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses represents the addition of offices personnel and other infrastructure necessary to support our growth as well as increased developmental expenses associated with our higher levels of new tower builds and acquisition activities and an increase in noncash compensation expenses in 2001 included in selling general and administrative expense is noncash compensation expense of 33 million for 2001 and 03 million for 2000 the increase in 2001 is attributable primarily to the use of stock and options as payment for certain bonuses as a percentage of total revenue excluding noncash compensation expenses selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 157 for 2001 from 164 in 2000 

  

during the twelve months ended december 31 2001 we recorded a 244 million charge relating to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction operations approximately 241 million of this charge related to costs that were previously reflected in our balance sheet as constructioninprocess the remaining 03 million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for 102 employees and the costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were primarily utilized in our new asset development activities 

  

during 2002 we approved a restructuring plan and anticipate incurring charges of between 300 million and 650 million relating to a further reduction in our new tower development activities this charge will be comprised of costs related to the disposal of new tower build and acquisition constructioninprocess costs related to employee separation costs associated with the closing of offices and other items the amount of the charge related to asset disposals will be determined primarily by the fair value of new tower backlog and constructioninprocess with respect to those new builds we choose to dispose of 

  

depreciation and amortization increased to 805 million for 2001 as compared to 348 million for 2000 this increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 2001 as compared to 2000 as our fixed assets begin to mature we will be continuing to evaluate the useful lives of the assets and may decide to change these useful lives based on the circumstances if the useful lives of assets are reduced depreciation may be accelerated in future years beginning in 2002 as a result of the implementation of sfas 142 the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets against earnings will no longer occur amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets during 2001 was 69 million 

  

operating loss increased to 480 million for the year ended 2001 from 31 million in 2000 as a result of increased depreciation and the restructuring and other charge in 2001 other expense net increased to 705 million for the year ended 2001 from 246 million for the year ended 2000 this increase is a result of an increase in interest expense due to interest associated with the 10¼ senior notes as well as increases in other debt balances 

  

earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses “ebitda” increased 880 to 602 million for the year ended 2001 from 320 million for the year ended 2000 the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda to net loss available to common shareholders 

  

 

  

year ended 2000 compared to year ended 1999 

  

total revenues increased 930 to 1679 million for 2000 from 870 million for 1999 total site development revenue increased 913 to 1159 million in 2000 from 606 million in 1999 due to an increase in both site development construction revenue and site development consulting revenue site development construction revenue increased 1151 to 916 million for 2000 from 426 million for 1999 due to the inclusion of network services for an entire year as well as higher levels of activity site development consulting revenue increased 350 to 243 million for 2000 from 180 million for 1999 due to the increased demand for site acquisition and zoning services from wireless communications carriers site leasing revenue increased 968 to 520 million for 2000 from 264 million for 1999 due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during 2000 as compared to 1999 

  

total cost of revenues increased 869 to 1084 million for 2000 from 579 million for 1999 site development cost of revenue increased 939 to 889 million in 2000 from 458 million in 1999 due to higher site development revenues site development consulting cost of revenue increased 258 to 156 million for 2000 from 124 million for 1999 reflecting higher site development consulting revenues site development construction cost of revenue increased 1192 to 732 million for 2000 from 334 million for 1999 due to higher site development construction revenues which resulted primarily from the inclusion of network services for an entire year site leasing cost of revenue increased 607 to 195 million for 2000 from 121 million for 1999 due primarily to the increased number of towers owned 

  

gross profit increased to 595 million for 2000 from 291 million for 1999 due to increased site development and site leasing revenues gross profit from site development increased 829 to 270 million in 2000 from 148 million in 1999 due to higher site development revenues gross profit margins for site development decreased in 2000 to 233 from 244 in 1999 due to a greater relative amount of lower margin site development construction business gross profit margin on site development consulting increased to 356 for 2000 from 309 for 1999 this increase is attributable to a change in the mix of our business to include more multipurpose projects producing both site development revenue and buildtosuit towers gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to 201 for 2000 from 216 in 1999 due to an increase in the use of subcontractor labor gross profit for the site leasing business increased 1275 in 2000 from 541 in 1999 the increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2000 period the increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and the resulting increase in average revenue per tower which was greater than the increase in average expenses as a percentage of total revenues gross profit increased to 354 of total revenues in 2000 from 334 in 1999 due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit 

  

selling general and administrative expenses increased 405 to 278 million for 2000 from 198 million for 1999 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses represents the addition of offices personnel and other infrastructure necessary to support our continued growth as well as increased developmental expenses associated with our higher levels of new tower builds and acquisition activities as a percentage of total revenue selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 166 for 2000 from 227 in 1999 

  

depreciation and amortization increased to 348 million for 2000 as compared to 166 million for 1999 this increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 2000 as compared to 1999 

  

operating loss decreased to 31 million for the year ended 2000 from 73 million in 1999 as a result of the increased gross profit in 2000 other expense net decreased to 246 million for the year ended 2000 from 264 million for the year ended 1999 the decrease is attributable to higher interest income on increased cash balances which more than offset an increase in interest expense the increase in interest expense is due to increased interest associated with the senior credit facility amortization of deferred financing charges and original issue discount partially offset by increased interest capitalization as a result of increased construction activity the extraordinary item in 1999 of 11 million relates to the writeoff of deferred financing fees associated with a prior bank credit agreement net loss was 289 million for the year ended 2000 as compared to net loss of 339 million for the year ended 1999 

  

earnings loss before interest taxes depreciation amortization noncash charges and unusual or nonrecurring expenses “ebitda” increased 2342 to 320 million for the year ended 2000 from 96 million for the year ended 1999 the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda to net loss to common shareholders 

  

 

 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

  

sba communications corporation is a holding company with no business operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these subsidiaries even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend our ability to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures related to our senior notes and senior discount notes 

  

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2001 was 130 million as compared to 475 million in 2000 this decrease was primarily attributable to increased interest expense net cash used in investing activities for year ended december 31 2001 was 5303 million compared to 4453 million for the year ended december 31 2000 this increase was primarily attributable to a higher level of tower acquisitions in 2001 versus 2000 net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december 31 2001 was 5162 million compared to 4096 million for the year ended december 31 2000 the increase in net cash provided by financing activities in 2001 was attributable to our offering of our 10¼ senior notes closed in february 2001 and borrowings under our senior credit facility 

  

our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of 214 million as of december 31 2001 and negative working capital of 275 million as of december 31 2000 our negative working capital balances are primarily due to the timing of receipts for accounts receivable payment of accounts payable accrued expenses and interest payable related to our business operations 

  

in february 2001 we issued 5000 million of 10¼ senior notes due 2009 which produced net proceeds of approximately 4843 million after deducting offering expenses interest on these notes is payable on february 1 and august 1 of each year beginning august 1 2001 the 10¼ senior notes are unsecured and are pari passu in right of payment with our other existing and future senior indebtedness the 10¼ senior notes place certain restrictions on among other things the incurrence of debt and liens issuance of preferred stock payment of dividends or other distributions sale of assets transactions with affiliates sale and leaseback transactions certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other entities 

  

at december 31 2001 we had 5000 million outstanding on our 10¼ senior notes the 10¼ senior notes mature february 1 2009 additionally at december 31 2001 we had 2349 million outstanding on our 12 senior discount notes net of unamortized original issue discount of 341 million the 12 senior discount notes mature on march 1 2008 

  

in june 2001 sba telecommunications inc our principal subsidiary entered into a 3000 million senior secured credit facility the facility provides for a 1000 million term loan and a 2000 million revolving loan the availability of which is based on compliance with certain covenants sba telecommunications drew the full 1000 million of the term loan during 2001 as well as 100 million of the revolver the term loan and the 

revolving loan mature june 15 2007 and repayment of the term loan begins in september 2003 borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue interest at the euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin as defined in the agreement the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of sba telecommunications and its subsidiaries the facility also places certain restrictions on among other things the incurrence of debt and liens the sale of assets capital expenditures transactions with affiliates sale and leaseback transactions and the number of towers that can be built without anchor tenants as of december 31 2001 we were in full compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility and the remaining 1900 million under the senior credit facility was available to us at december 31 2001 we had the 1000 million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility at variable rates of 476 to 487 and 100 million outstanding under the revolving credit facility at a 65 variable rate 

  

our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2001 were 5303 million which was principally used for the construction and acquisition of new towers in our portfolio and the acquisition of two site development construction companies we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year ending december 31 2002 of 850 million to 1350 million all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand cash flow from operations and borrowings under our senior credit facility the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support or increase our tower portfolio 

  

in order to manage our indebtedness we may from time to time sell assets issue equity or repurchase restructure or refinance some or all of our debt our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or to pay interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt obligations including the 10¼ senior notes or the 12 senior discount notes or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future performance which to a certain extent is subject to general economic financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 

  

we have on file with the securities and exchange commission “sec” shelf registration statements on form s4 registering up to a total of 80 million shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states during the year ended december 31 2001 we issued 16 million shares of class a common stock under these registration statements in connection with six acquisitions and certain earnouts as of december 31 2001 we had 57 million shares of class a common stock remaining available under these shelf registration statements subsequent to december 31 2001 we issued 587260 shares under these shelf registration statements in connection with certain earnouts 

  

we have on file with the sec a universal shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to 2527 million of any combination of the following securities class a common stock preferred stock debt securities depositary shares or warrants 

  

inflation 

  

the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 

  

critical accounting policies 

  

we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states with no need for management’s judgement in their application in other cases management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results for a detailed discussion on 

the application of these and other accounting policies see note 2 in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item 8 of this annual report on form 10k beginning on page f7 note that our preparation of this annual report on form 10k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

  

revenue recognition and accounts receivable 

  

revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over the term of the related lease agreements rental amounts received in advance are recorded in other liabilities 

  

site development projects in which the company performs consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered for those site development contracts in which the company performs work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis the company recognizes the revenue related to that phase revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by the company at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to the company’s results of operations any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident site development projects generally take from 3 to 12 months to complete 

  

revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageofcompletion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management’s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset “costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts” represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the liability “billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts” represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 

  

cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred cost of site leasing revenue include rent maintenance and other tower expenses provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 

  

  

we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past our accounts receivable balance was 568 million net of allowance for doubtful accounts of 46 million as of december 31 2001 

  

property and equipment 

  

property and equipment are recorded at cost depreciation is provided using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives leasehold improvements are amortized on a straightline basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset industry practice and asset maintenance policies maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 

  

asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows 

  

 

  

capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset changes in an asset’s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life term we reduced the useful lives on 134 towers this change in useful lives did not have a material impact in 2001 

  

goodwill 

  

we continually evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives or recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant negative trend in our operating results or cash flows a decrease in demand for our services a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors we measure impairment of unamortized goodwill utilizing the undiscounted cash flow method over the remaining estimated life any impairment loss would be calculated as the amount which the carrying amount of the unamortized balance exceeds its fair value as of december 31 2001 we determined that there has been no impairment of goodwill 

  

we expect to adopt statement of financial accounting standards no 142 goodwill and other intangible assets “sfas 142” in the first quarter of 2002 with the adoption of sfas 142 we will assess the impact based on a twostep approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and will reassess any intangible assets including goodwill recorded in connection with our previous acquisitions we had recorded approximately 69 million of amortization on these amounts during 2001 and would have recorded approximately 100 million of amortization during 2002 in lieu of amortization we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in 2002 and an annual impairment review thereafter we are currently assessing but have not yet determined the impact adoption of sfas 142 will have on our consolidated financial statements however we believe it may be material as of december 31 2001 we had unamortized goodwill and covenants not to compete of 862 million 

  

accounting for income taxes 

  

as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included within our consolidated balance sheet we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely we must establish a valuation allowance to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 

  

significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets we have recorded a valuation allowance of 720 million as of december 31 2001 due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets primarily consisting of net operating losses carried forward before they expire the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations the net deferred tax liability as of december 31 2001 was 184 million 

  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

  

we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business during the year ended december 31 2001 we were subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility at december 31 2001 our fixed rate debt consisted primarily of the balance on the 10¼ senior notes and the accreted balance of the 12 senior discount notes in the future we may be subject to increased rate risk on our senior credit facility interest rate swap or any other further financing we may enter into 

  

the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our existing longterm debt instruments assuming our actual level of longterm indebtedness 

  

 

  

in january 2002 we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap is 1000 million the maturity date of the interest rate swap matches the principal maturity date of the 10¼ senior notes the underlying debt february 2009 this swap involves the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the variable rates are based on sixmonth euro rate plus 447 and are reset on a semiannual basis 

  

our primary market risk exposure relates to 1 the interest rate risk on longterm and shortterm borrowings and on our interest rate swap agreement 2 our ability to refinance our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes at maturity at market rates and 3 the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and exceed financial covenants we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding longterm and shortterm debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 

  

senior discount note disclosure requirements 

  

the indentures governing our 10¼ senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of tower cash flow as defined in the indentures for the most recent fiscal quarter and adjusted consolidated cash flow as defined in the indentures for the most recently completed fourquarter period as of december 31 2001 we had no unrestricted subsidiaries tower cash flow as defined in the indentures for the quarter ended december 31 2001 was 157 million adjusted consolidated cash flow for the year ended december 31 2001 was 733 million

item i business

general

  we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications
towers in the united states we generate revenues from our two primary
businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business
we lease antenna space on towers and other structures that we own or manage
for others the towers that we own have either been built by us at the request
of a wireless carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative as of
december 31 2000 we owned or controlled 2390 towers and had agreements to
acquire 677 towers we also had carrier directives to build approximately 600
additional towers and had in various phases of development over 1000
locations which we had internally identified as a desirable location on which
to build a tower the following chart shows the number of towers we
constructed for our own account and the number of towers we acquired during

  in our site development business we offer wireless service providers
assistance in developing their own networks including designing a network
with full signal coverage identifying and acquiring locations to place their
antennas obtaining zoning approvals building towers when necessary and
installing their antennas since our founding in 1989 we have participated in
the development of more than 15000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major
wireless markets in the united states

business strategy

  our primary strategy is to expand the scope of our position as a leading
owner and operator of wireless communications towers and provider of site
development services key elements of our strategy include

  maximizing use of tower capacity we believe that many of our towers have
significant capacity available for antenna space leasing and that increased
use of our owned towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost we
generally construct our towers to accommodate multiple tenants in addition to
the anchor tenant and a substantial majority of our towers are high capacity
lattice or guyed towers we actively market space on our own towers through
our internal sales force

  developing new towers that we will own and operate as wireless service
providers increasingly outsource their investment in and ownership of
towers we can meet their outsourcing needs through our buildtosuit
programs we can also independently identify attractive locations for new
towers and strategically complete preconstruction procedures necessary to
secure tower sites in advance of customer demand as of december 31 2000 we
were in varying stages of development on over 1000 additional sites which we
believe will be attractive locations for strategic new tower construction in
2000 we built 779 towers for our own account

  acquiring existing towers we believe that our existing national field
organization gives us a competitive advantage in identifying opportunities for
the acquisition of existing towers our strategy is to acquire towers that can
service multiple tenants and are attractive to wireless service providers
based on their location height and available capacity while we generally
target smaller acquisitions we believe that there are many potential
acquisition candidates and that the number of towers available for purchase
will remain substantial over the next three to five years as cellular pcs and
other wireless service providers continue to divest their tower holdings we
have strict valuation criteria and believe that certain tower properties can
be purchased at price levels which will allow us to attain our financial
targets in 2000 we acquired 448 towers as of december 31 2000 we had
letters of intent or definitive agreements to acquire 677 towers in 33
separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2185
million

  capturing other revenues that flow from our tower ownership tenants who
lease antenna space on our towers need a variety of additional services in
connection with their operations at the tower site these services include
installation maintenance and upgrading of radio transmission equipment
antennas cabling and other connection equipment electricity backhaul
which is provided generally by telephone lines or a microwave antenna
network equipment shelters data collection and network monitoring tenants
often outsource the performance of some or all of these required services to
third parties including us because of our ownership of the tower our
control of the tower site and our experience and capabilities in providing
these types of services we believe that we are well positioned and intend
to perform more of these services and capture the related revenue

  executing on a local basis we believe that substantially all of what we do
is best done locally given the nature of towers as location specific
communications facilities we believe that to be successful in tower building
acquisition and leasing and site acquisition zoning and construction we
must have strong local presences in the markets we serve

  building on strong relationships with major wireless service providers we
are wellpositioned to be a preferred partner in buildtosuit programs site
development projects and tower space leasing because of our strong
relationships with wireless service and other telecommunications providers and
our proven operating experience in many cases the personnel awarding site
development projects for wireless service providers are the same personnel who
make decisions with respect to buildtosuit programs we continually market
our buildtosuit programs to our site development service customers

  maintaining our expertise in site development services we continue to
perform an array of site development services for wireless service and other
telecommunications providers across the united states we have a broad
national field organization that allows us to identify and participate in site
development projects across the country and that gives us a knowledge of local
markets and strong customer relationships with wireless service and other
telecommunications providers we believe our site development experience
provides us with a competitive advantage in selecting the best locations for
tower ownership

  capitalizing on our management experience our management team has extensive
experience in site leasing and site development services management believes
that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless carriers
will allow us to continue to build and acquire a high quality portfolio of
towers steven e bernstein our chief executive officer has more than 13
years of experience in the wireless communications industry and our other
officers have an average of approximately ten years of experience in this
industry in addition management is highly motivated to produce strong
operating results based on their significant equity ownership

company services

  we provide our services on a local basis through regional offices
territory offices and project offices which are opened and closed on a
project by project basis operationally we are divided into four regions
throughout the united states run by regional vice presidents each region is
divided into two or more subregions run by general managers and we have
further divided each subregion into three to six geographic territories run
by territory managers within each territory managers geographic area of
responsibility he or she is responsible for all operations including hiring
employees and opening or closing project offices and a substantial portion of
the sales in such area

  our executive corporate development accounting finance human resources
legal and regulatory information technology departments site administration
personnel and our network operations center are located in our headquarters
in boca raton florida we also have in our boca raton office certain sales
new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel

site leasing business

  the primary focus of our site leasing business is the leasing of antenna
space on our multitenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers
under longterm lease contracts we lease antenna space on

     the towers we construct through carrier directives under buildtosuit
      programs

     existing towers we acquire

     the towers we construct on locations we have selected which we call
      strategic new tower builds and

     towers we lease sublease andor manage for third parties

  we lease and sublease antenna space on our towers to a variety of wireless
service providers we own or lease the ground under these towers from third
parties and in some cases manage communication sites for third parties in
exchange for a percentage of the revenues or tower cash flow we determine
tower cash flow by subtracting from gross tenant revenues the direct expenses
associated with operating the tower such as ground lease payments real
estate taxes utilities insurance and maintenance the majority of our owned
or controlled towers we built through buildtosuit programs in our buildto
suit programs we use some or all of the five phases of our site development
business as we would when providing site development services to a third
party

  after a tower has been constructed we lease antenna space on the tower we
generally receive monthly lease payments from customers payable under written
antenna site leases the majority of our outstanding customer leases and the
new leases we typically enter into have original terms of five years with
four or five renewal periods of five years each and usually provide for
annual or periodic price increases monthly lease pricing varies with the
number and type of antenna installed on a communication site we also provide
a leasesublease service as part of our site leasing business whereby we lease
space on a tower and sublease the space to a wireless service provider

  we believe that the site leasing portion of our business has significant
potential for growth and we intend to expand our site leasing business
through increasing activity from our new tower builds and selective
acquisitions our tower portfolio has continued to grow from 51 at yearend
1997 to 494 in 1998 to 1163 in 1999 to 2390 in 2000 as of december 31 2000
we had 5548 tenants

 buildtosuit programs

  under a buildtosuit program we build a tower for a wireless service
provider on a location of their direction we retain ownership of the tower
and the exclusive right to colocate additional tenants on the tower many
wireless service providers are choosing the buildtosuit option as an
alternative to tower ownership and we believe that this outsourcing trend is
likely to continue we believe that we have one of the largest number of non
binding buildtosuit mandates from wireless service providers in the
industry as of december 31 2000 we had carrier directives to build
approximately 600 additional towers under buildtosuit programs for carriers
under our buildtosuit programs we have built towers for many carriers
including alamosa pcs att wireless cingular georgia pcs gte horizon pcs
leap wireless nextel primeco pcs sprint pcs telecorp pcs tritel pcs and
voicestream in selling our buildtosuit programs our personnel use their
existing relationships in the wireless communications industry to target
wireless service providers interested in outsourcing their network buildout
we make proposals for buildtosuit towers in response to competitive bids or
specific requests and in circumstances where we believe the provider would
have an interest in buildtosuit towers we price build to suit agreements
after having made the determination that the expected tower cash flow from
those towers will produce a targeted return on investment after a certain
period of time although the terms vary from proposal to proposal we
typically sign a fiveyear lease agreement with the anchor tenant with four
or five additional fiveyear renewal periods at the option of the lessee
while the proposed monthly rent also varies broadband customers such as pcs
cellular or esmr generally pay more than the aggregate monthly rent paid by
paging or other narrowband customers in addition anchor tenants will
typically pay lower monthly rents than subsequent tenants of a similar type
service in some cases an anchor tenant may also enjoy an introductory lease
rate for a period of time if a wireless provider accepts the terms of the
proposal submitted by us the provider will award us a nonbinding mandate to
pursue specific sites based on the status of the geographic areas we have
been given a mandate to pursue we will perform due diligence investigations
for a designated period during which time we will analyze the site based on a
number of factors including colocation opportunities zoning and permitting
issues economic potential of the site difficulty of constructing a multi
tenant tower and remoteness of the site these mandates are generally non
binding agreements and either party may terminate the mandate at any time if
after our due diligence investigation during the mandate we conclude that it
is economically feasible to construct the towers requested by the wireless
service provider we will enter into an antenna site lease agreement with the
provider in certain limited circumstances we are contractually obligated to
build a tower for the carrier regardless of the outcome of our due diligence
investigation we have negotiated several master buildtosuit agreements
including antenna site lease terms with providers in specific markets the
antenna site lease agreements typically provide that all obligations are
conditioned on our receiving all necessary zoning approvals where zoning
remains to be obtained certain of the antenna site lease agreements contain
penalty or forfeiture provisions in the event the tower is not completed
within specified time periods

 strategic siting

  our strategic siting activities focus on developing new towers in locations
chosen by us instead of by an anchor tenant in a buildtosuit program as of
december 31 2000 of our total 779 new builds 284 were through our strategic
siting programs and we expect this number to grow in the future we try to
identify attractive locations for new towers and complete preconstruction
procedures necessary to secure the site in advance of demand from a specific
customer we may invest in the zoning and permitting of these strategic sites
and even the construction of the towers when we have not yet obtained an
anchor tenant for competitive or zoning reasons however we generally will
not build a tower on a strategic site until we have signed a lease with a
tenant

 acquisitions

  we actively pursue acquisitions of towers our acquisition strategy like
our new build strategy is financiallyoriented as opposed to geographically
or customeroriented our goal is to acquire towers that have

                                       6
page

an initial or planned capital investment not exceeding a targeted multiple of
expected tower cash flow from the acquired towers after a certain period of
time we determine tower cash flow by subtracting from gross tenant revenues
the direct expenses associated with operating the tower such as ground lease
payments real estate taxes utilities insurance and maintenance our
dedicated mergers and acquisitions personnel direct our acquisition activities
and are responsible for identification negotiation documentation and
consummation of acquisition opportunities as well as the coordination and
management of independent advisors and consultants retained by us from time to
time in connection with acquisitions in addition to our mergers and
acquisitions personnel we rely on our national employee base to identify
potential acquisitions our field employees identify generally smaller
acquisition prospects involving one to ten towers we often have an exclusive
opportunity to structure and consummate a transaction with the potential
seller we believe that our field employees and knowledge of potential
acquisition candidates gained through our substantial site development
business experience provide us with a competitive advantage this information
permits us to identify and consummate acquisitions on generally more favorable
terms than would be available to us through competitivelybid or brokered
acquisition prospects as is the case with our new tower builds our focus is
to acquire multitenant towers with underused capacity in locations that we
believe will be attractive to wireless service providers that have not yet
built out their service in these locations

 leasesublease

  under our leasesublease program we lease antenna space on a tower then
sublease the space to wireless service providers when these leasesubleases
were first signed these providers chose the financial benefits associated
with the leasesublease program which include reduced capital expenditures
as compared to paying for site development services on a fee basis wireless
paging providers comprise a significant majority of customers who sublease
antenna sites from us the subleases generally have original terms of five
years with four or five renewal periods of five years each at the option of
the lessee and usually provide for annual or periodic price increases

 related services

  to help maximize the revenue and profit we earn from our capital investment
in the towers we own we have begun to provide services at our tower locations
beyond the leasing of antenna space these services which we provide or may
provide in the future include generator provisioning power provisioning
antenna installation equipment installation and backhaul which is the
transport of the wireless signals transmitted or received by an antenna to a
carriers network some of these services are recurring in nature and are
contracted for by a wireless carrier or other user in a manner similar to the
way they lease antenna space

 maintenance and management

  once acquired or constructed we maintain and manage our towers through a
combination of inhouse personnel and independent contractors we also manage
towers for third parties inhouse personnel are responsible for oversight and
supervision of all aspects of site maintenance and management and are
particularly responsible for monitoring security access and lighting rf
emission and interference issues signage structural engineering and tower
capacity tenant relations and supervision of independent contractors we hire
independent contractors locally to perform routine maintenance functions such
as landscaping pest control snow removal vehicular access site access and
equipment installation oversight we engage independent contractors on a fixed
fee or time and materials basis or in a few limited circumstances where these
contractors were sellers of towers to us for a percentage of tower cash flow
our network operations center in boca raton florida centrally monitors
security access and lighting for our towers as well as other functions as
the number of towers we own and manage increases we anticipate incurring
greater expenditures to expand our maintenance infrastructure including
expenditures for personnel and computer hardware and software we expect these
expenditures to be marginal compared to the anticipated increased revenues
from site leasing

site development services

  our site development business consists of two segments site development
consulting and site development construction through this business we offer
wireless service providers assistance on each stage of the development of a
wireless network infrastructure from network predesign through installation
of antenna and radio equipment

  we deliver our site development services to a diverse range of customers
including cellular pcs wireless data and internet services paging smr and
esmr providers as well as other users of wireless transmission and reception
equipment our customers currently comprise many of the major wireless
communications companies and their affiliates including att wireless
cingular nextel sprint pcs verizon and voicestream

  our site development business also provides us expertise and knowledge which
complements our site leasing business specifically our strong relationships
with wireless service providers created and strengthened through our site
development business provide the basis for our buildtosuit programs in
addition we are often able to use our site development activities to enhance
our strategic new tower build programs by identifying an area without wireless
signal coverage on which to build a tower for the benefit of a current or
potential customer

 site development consulting

  in the consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients
the following services 1 network predesign 2 identification of
potential locations for towers and antennas 3 support in buying or leasing
of the location and 4 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits
once we are awarded a site development project we dispatch a site development
team to the project site and may establish a temporary field office for the
duration of the project the site development team is typically composed of
our permanent employees and supplemented with local hires employed only for
that particular project a team leader is assigned to each phase of the site
development project and reports to a project manager who oversees all team
leaders upon the completion of a site development project the project office
is typically closed and all of our permanent employees are either relocated to
another project or directed to return to one of our offices

  we generally set prices for each site development service separately
customers are billed for these services on a fixed price or time and materials
basis and we may negotiate fees on individual sites or for groups of sites

 site development construction

  in the construction segment of our site development business we provide a
number of services including the following 1 tower and related site
construction 2 switch construction 3 antenna installation and 4 radio
equipment installation optimization and service

  we provide these services on a turnkey basis throughout the united states
alternatively with respect to towers on which carriers are looking to become
tenants we can install maintain and upgrade radio transmission equipment
antennas cabling and other equipment we began offering direct as opposed to
subcontracted construction services in 1997 with our acquisition of
communications site services inc which provided us with inhouse tower
construction and antenna installation capability we expanded our operations
through the acquisition of several telecommunications construction companies
the most notable of which was sba network services inc network services
fka comnet construction services inc in 1999 to include additional
tower construction equipment installation and antenna installation capability
as well as the ability to construct terminal switches for wireless carriers
competitive local exchange carriers and other telecommunications providers

  we have constructed and expect to continue to construct a portion of our
towers in the future and provide equipment and antenna installation services
for tenants on our towers we believe we costeffectively and timely complete
construction projects in part because our site development personnel are
crosstrained in all areas of site development construction and antenna
installation

                                       8

  while we believe that our site development business will grow with the
expected overall growth of wireless and other telecommunications networks we
believe our revenues and gross profit from the consulting segment of that
business may continue to decline as carriers find new ways to obtain network
development through outsourced tower ownership we also believe that over the
longer term our site leasing revenues will continue to increase due to the
same outsourcing trend and as the number of towers we own or control grows

customers

development services for many of the largest wireless service providers the
majority of our contracts have been for pcs broadband esmr cellular largest

  historically we have capitalized on the strength of our experience
performance and relationships with wireless service providers to position
ourselves for additional site development business we have leveraged these
attributes to obtain buildtosuit mandates and we expect to continue to do
so in the future we also use these attributes to identify attractive
locations to build towers on strategic sites

  we approach sales on a companywide basis involving many of our employees
we have a dedicated sales force which is supplemented by members of our
executive management team our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as
well as in the corporate office we also rely on our regional managers
territory managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and
cultivate customers our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those
employees of ours who have the best relationships with the wireless service
providers most wireless service providers have national corporate
headquarters with regional offices we believe that most decisions for site
development and site leasing services are made by providers at the regional
level with input from their corporate headquarters our sales representatives
work with provider representatives at the local level and at the national
level when appropriate our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to
incentivebased goals and measurements a substantial number of our operations
personnel have salesbased incentive components in their compensation plans

  in addition to our marketing and sales staff we rely upon our executive and
operations personnel on the regional and territory office levels to identify
sales opportunities within existing customer accounts as well as acquisition
opportunities

  our primary marketing and sales support is centralized and directed from our
headquarters office in boca raton florida and is supplemented by our regional
and territory offices we have a fulltime staff dedicated to our marketing
efforts the marketing and sales support staff are charged with implementing
our marketing strategies prospecting and producing sales presentation
materials and proposals

competition

  we compete with

     wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower
      footprints and lease or may in the future decide to lease antenna
      space to other providers

     site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing
      towers for wireless service providers manage new tower construction
      and provide site development services

     other large independent tower companies and

     smaller local independent tower operators

for towers to acquire and for sites to construct towers

  wireless service providers that own and operate their own tower networks
generally are substantially larger and have greater financial resources than
we do we believe that tower location and capacity price quality of service
and density within a geographic market historically have been and will
continue to be the most significant competitive factors affecting the site
leasing business we also compete for development and new tower construction
opportunities with wireless service providers site developers and other
independent tower operating companies and believe that competition for site
development will increase and that additional competitors will enter the tower
market some of which may have greater financial resources than we do

  the following is a list of our primary competitors for new tower builds and
tower acquisitions american tower corporation crown castle international
corp pinnacle holdings inc and spectrasite holdings inc

  we believe that the majority of our competitors in the site development
business operate within local market areas exclusively while some firms
appear to offer their services nationally including american tower
corporation bechtel black  veach general dynamics mastec mericom qserve
and spectrasite holdings inc the market includes participants from a variety
of market segments offering individual or combinations of competing

regulatory and environmental matters

  federal regulations both the federal communications commission fcc and
the federal aviation administration faa regulate towers used for wireless
communications transmitters and receivers these regulations control the
siting and marking of towers and may depending on the characteristics of
particular towers require prior approval and registration of tower
facilities wireless communications devices operating on towers are separately
regulated and independently licensed based upon the particular frequency used

  pursuant to the requirements of the communications act of 1934 the fcc in
conjunction with the faa has developed standards to consider proposals for
new or modified antennas these standards mandate that the fcc and the faa
consider the height of proposed antennas the relationship of the structure to
existing natural or manmade obstructions and the proximity of the antennas to
runways and airports proposals to construct or to modify existing antennas
above certain heights must be reviewed by the faa to ensure the structure will
not present a hazard to aviation the faa may condition its issuance of a no
hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting andor marking
requirements towers required to be reviewed by the faa must also be
registered with the fcc the fcc will not license the operation of wireless
telecommunications devices on towers unless the tower has been registered with
the fcc the fcc will not register a tower unless it has been cleared by the
faa the fcc may also enforce special lighting and painting requirements
owners of wireless transmissions towers may have an obligation to maintain
painting and lighting to conform to fcc standards tower owners also bear the
responsibility of notifying the faa of any tower lighting outage in addition
any applicant for an fcc antenna structure registration must certify that
consistent with the antidrug abuse act of 1988 neither the applicant nor its
principals have been convicted of a federal drug crime we generally indemnify
our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory
standards failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to
civil penalties

  the telecommunications act of 1996 amended the communications act of 1934 by
preserving state and local zoning authorities jurisdiction over the
construction modification and placement of towers the new law however
limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would
1 discriminate between different providers of personal wireless services or
2 ban altogether the construction modification or placement of radio
communication towers finally the telecommunications act of 1996 requires the
federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain
access to preferred sites for their facilities this may require that federal
agencies and departments work directly with licensees to make federal property
available for tower facilities

  owners and operators of antennas may be subject to and therefore must
comply with environmental laws the fccs decision to register a proposed
tower or license radio facilities on a tower may be subject to environmental
review pursuant to the national environmental policy act of 1969 which
requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impacts of their
decisions under certain circumstances the fcc has issued regulations
implementing the national environmental policy act these regulations place
responsibility on each applicant to investigate any potential environmental
effects of operations and to disclose any potential

                                      11
page

significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to
constructing a tower in the event the fcc determines the proposed tower would
have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the fcc has
developed the fcc would be required to prepare an environmental impact
statement which will be subject to public comment this process could
significantly delay the registration of a particular tower

  as an owner and operator of real property we are subject to certain
environmental laws that impose strict joint and several liability for the
cleanup of onsite or offsite contamination and related personal or property
damages we are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern tower
placement including preconstruction environmental studies operators of
towers must also take into consideration certain rf emissions regulations that
impose a variety of procedural and operating requirements the potential
connection between rf emissions and certain negative health effects including
some forms of cancer has been the subject of substantial study by the
scientific community in recent years to date the results of these studies
have been inconclusive we believe that we are in substantial compliance with
and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws
these costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and
liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects
financial condition or results of operations

  state and local regulations most states regulate certain aspects of real
estate acquisition and leasing activities where required we conduct the site
acquisition portions of our site development services business through
licensed real estate brokers or agents who may be our employees or hired as
independent contractors local regulations include city and other local
ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants imposed by community
developers these regulations vary greatly but typically require tower owners
to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations
prior to tower construction local zoning authorities generally have been
hostile to construction of new transmission towers in their communities
because of the height and visibility of the towers

recent developments

  in september 2000 we entered into an agreement to acquire 275 existing
towers from telecorp pcs inc in illinois louisiana tennessee texas
mississippi missouri arkansas and puerto rico the acquisition price of the
towers will be 327500 per tower contingent on the closing of the telecorp
tower acquisition we have agreed to become the exclusive buildtosuit
provider for telecorp under the buildtosuit agreement we will construct a
minimum of 200 tower facilities and up to a maximum of 400 tower facilities
under the terms of the acquisition telecorp will enter into longterm leases
at a monthly rate of 1200 per acquired tower and 1300 per built tower to
place its wireless network equipment on each tower acquired or built on
march 16 2001 we acquired 203 towers of the 275 towers under the agreement
for 665 million and we anticipate completing the acquisition of the
remaining 72 towers in the second quarter of 2001 the remaining tower
acquisitions are subject to our satisfactory completion of our review of the
business financial and legal aspects of towers that may be acquired as of
december 31 2000 the 275 towers which would be purchased if the telecorp
transaction was consummated had an annualized run rate including pending
leases of approximately 61 million in revenues and approximately
39 million in cash flow

  in december 2000 we entered into an agreement with louisiana unwired inc
a subsidiary of us unwired inc to acquire 300 towers in louisiana texas
and arkansas pursuant to the terms of the agreement we purchased 127 of the
300 towers on december 29 2000 we have the obligation to purchase the
remaining 173 towers subject to the receipt of certain consents by may 1
2001 additionally the agreement granted us the option until december 31
2001 to purchase the lesser of 1 the number of towers constructed by
louisiana unwired during 2001 and 2 100 towers our ability to exercise this
option is contingent upon our a securing financing adequate to purchase the
towers and b placing in escrow a deposit of 167 million prior to april 10
2001 the acquisition price for each of the towers covered by the agreement is
313000 per tower under the terms of the acquisition agreement us unwired
has agreed to enter into longterm leases at a monthly rate of 1500 per
tower to place its wireless network equipment at each tower that we purchase
as of

                                      12
page

december 31 2000 the 300 towers including the 173 towers which would be
purchased if the second stage of the us unwired transaction was consummated
had an annualized run rate including pending leases of approximately 58
million in revenues and approximately 34 million in cash flow

  while all of the towers acquired from telecorp and us unwired will generate
revenues immediately upon consummation of their respective acquisition the
towers will not at such time be profitable we cannot assure you that these
towers will ever be profitable because these towers will be profitable only if
we are able to sign additional leases with third parties for the location of
antennas on these towers

  the acquisition of the remaining 72 telecorp towers and the remaining 273 us
unwired towers are subject to numerous closing conditions we cannot assure
you if or when either of these transactions will close

backlog

  our backlog for site development services was 610 million as of december
31 2000 as compared to 400 million as of december 31 1999 our backlog for
pending tower acquisitions was 677 towers as of december 31 2000 as compared
to 94 towers as of december 31 1999 our backlog under buildtosuit mandates
was approximately 600 towers as of december 31 2000 as compared to 335 as of
december 31 1999 we anticipate that we will fulfill all of these services
and complete the pending tower acquisitions during the current fiscal year

risk factors

  our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and
prevent us from fulfilling our payment obligations

  as indicated below we have and will continue to have a significant amount
of indebtedness relative to our equity size



                                     at december 31 2000 after note offeringa
                                      
                                                   in thousands
                                                    
      total indebtedness       284273              709273
      stockholders equity       538160              533397


     a subsequent to december 31 2000 we borrowed 300 million
         under the revolving line of credit in february 2001 the
         company issued 5000 million of its 10 14 senior notes
         due 2009 and used 1050 million to repay all amounts
         outstanding under the senior credit facility in
         connection with the termination of our senior credit
         facility we recorded an extraordinary loss of 48
         million related to the writeoff of deferred financing
         fees associated with our existing senior credit facility
         in the first quarter of 2001

  our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to you for
example it could

     limit our ability to repay the 10 14 senior notes and the 12 senior
      discount notes

     limit our ability to fund future working capital capital expenditures
      and research and development costs

     limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our
      business and the industry in which we operate

     place us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are less
      leveraged and

     limit along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our
      indebtedness among other things our ability to borrow additional
      funds failing to comply with those covenants could result in an event
      of default

  our ability to service our debt obligations will depend on our future
operating performance if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from
operations to service our indebtedness we will be forced to adopt an
alternative strategy that may include actions such as reducing delaying or
eliminating acquisitions of towers or related service companies delaying
tower construction and other capital expenditures selling assets

                                      13
page

restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional equity
capital we may not be able to effect any of these alternative strategies on
satisfactory terms if at all the implementation of any of these alternative
strategies could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy

  our earnings have been insufficient to cover our fixed charges since the
issuance of our 12 senior discount notes treating the noncash amortization
of the original issue discount on the 12 senior discount notes as a fixed
charge this deficiency will increase as a result of the issuance of our
5000 million 10 14 senior notes completed in february 2001 we expect our
earnings to continue to be insufficient to cover our fixed charges for the
foreseeable future we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the
future if new debt is added to our current debt levels the related risks
that we face could intensify

  our debt instruments contain restrictive covenants that could adversely
affect our business by limiting flexibility

  the indentures governing our 10 14 senior notes and our 12 senior
discount notes each contain certain restrictive covenants in addition we
intend to enter into a new senior credit facility in the future and this new
facility will also likely contain restrictive covenants and require us to
maintain specified financial ratios and meet financial condition tests our
ability to comply with these covenants and meet these financial ratios and
tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we may not be able to
meet these covenants ratios and tests a breach of any of these covenants
could result in an event of default under the indentures governing the 10 14
senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes upon the occurrence of our
bankruptcy the outstanding principal together with all accrued interest
will automatically become immediately due and payable if any other event of
default including a continuing breach of our covenants should occur the
trustee or a percentage of such noteholders can elect to declare all amounts
of principal outstanding together with all accrued interest to be
immediately due and payable

  our quarterly operating results fluctuate and therefore should not be
considered indicative of our longterm results

  the number of towers we build the number of tenants we add to our towers
and the demand for our site development services fluctuate from quarter to
quarter and should not be considered as indicative of longterm results
numerous factors cause these fluctuations including

     the timing and amount of our customers capital expenditures

     the business practices of customers such as deferring commitments on
      new projects until after the end of the calendar year or the customers
      fiscal years

     the number and significance of active customer engagements during a
      quarter

     delays relating to a project or tenant installation of equipment

     seasonal factors such as weather vacation days and total business
      days in a quarter

     employee hiring

     the use of consultants by our customers and

     the rate and volume of wireless service providers network development

  although the demand for our services fluctuates we incur significant fixed
costs such as maintaining a staff and office space in anticipation of future
contracts the timing of revenues is difficult to forecast because our sales
cycle may be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and
scope of assignments budgetary cycles and pressures and general economic
conditions in addition under lease terms typical in the tower industry
revenue generated by new tenant leases usually commences upon installation of
the tenants

                                      14
page

equipment on the tower rather than upon execution of the lease which can be
90 days or more after the execution of the lease

  we may be adversely affected by an economic slowdown

  our business may be adversely affected by periods of economic slowdown or
recession during periods of economic slowdown or recession wireless carriers
may be unable to raise sufficient capital to expand their networks or may
choose to slow or stop capital expenditures any material decline in the
availability of capital for or in capital expenditures by our customers
would likely result in a decrease in the demand for tenant space on our towers
and for our site development services

  we may not secure as many site leasing tenants as planned

  if tenant demand for tower space decreases we may not be able to
successfully grow our site leasing business this may have a material adverse
effect on our strategy and revenue growth our plan for the growth of our site
leasing business largely depends on our managements expectations and
assumptions concerning future tenant demand for independentlyowned towers
tenant demand includes both the number of tenants and the lease rates they are
willing to pay we bear a greater risk from lower tenant demand than other
tower companies that have towers with positive cash flow because the majority
of our towers are newly constructed and have little or no positive cash flow
at the time of construction

  wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers and several
of the independent tower companies generally are substantially larger and have
greater financial resources than we do we believe that tower location and
capacity price quality of service and density within a geographic market
historically have been and will continue to be the most significant
competitive factors affecting the site leasing business

  we are not profitable and expect to continue to incur losses

  we are not profitable the following chart shows the net losses we incurred
for the periods indicated



                                    years ended december 31

        net losses    289    346    199


  our losses are principally due to significant depreciation amortization and
interest expense we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to
incur losses for the foreseeable future

  increased competition to purchase existing towers and to build new towers
may negatively affect the success of our growth strategy

  increased competition to purchase existing towers and to build new towers
may negatively affect the success of our growth strategy we compete for the
opportunity to build new towers primarily with site developers wireless
carriers and other independent tower companies we believe that competition
for the opportunity to build new towers will increase and that additional
competitors will enter the tower market some of these additional competitors
have or are expected to have greater financial resources than we do

  we compete with

     wireless service providers that own and operate their own towers

     site development companies that acquire antenna space on existing
      towers for wireless service providers manage new tower construction
      and provide site development services

     other large independent tower companies and

     smaller local independent tower operators

for towers to acquire and for sites to construct towers


                                      15
page

  our growth strategy depends in part on our ability to acquire and operate
existing towers not built by us to expand our existing tower network
increased competition for acquisitions may result in fewer acquisition
opportunities for us and higher acquisition prices we regularly explore
acquisition opportunities and we are currently actively negotiating to
acquire additional towers as of december 31 2000 we had agreements to
acquire 677 towers in 33 separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price
of 2185 million including 900 million for all 275 towers from telecorp
and 855 million for the additoinal 273 towers from us unwired or an average
acquisition price of approximately 323000 per tower while all of the towers
acquired from telecorp and us unwired will generate revenues immediately upon
consummation of their respective acquisition the towers will not at such time
be profitable we cannot assure you that these towers will ever be profitable
because these towers will be profitable only if we are able to sign additional
leases with third parties for the location of antennas on these towers all of
these acquisitions are subject to a number of conditions and may or may not
close

  we may not be able to identify finance and complete future acquisitions of
towers or tower companies on acceptable terms or may not be able to profitably
manage and market available space on any towers that we acquire we may also
face challenges in integrating newly acquired towers or tower companies with
our operations and may face difficulties in retaining current lessees on newly
acquired towers

  if our carrierdirected new tower build projects are unsuccessful in
yielding binding agreements or completed towers our growth strategy or
business may be negatively affected

  if our carrierdirected new tower build projects are unsuccessful in
yielding binding agreements or completed towers our growth strategy or
business may be negatively affected a carrier directive is an indication of
interest from a wireless carrier for us to build a tower which we will own on
which they will place their antenna upon completion of the tower the
wireless carrier would lease space on the tower a carrier directive however
does not require the wireless carrier to actually lease space on the tower
that obligation does not arise until a lease is signed we generally will not
commence construction of a tower on a carrierdirected location until a lease
is signed as of december 31 2000 we had carrier directives to build
approximately 600 towers under buildtosuit programs for wireless service
providers we believe that the majority of these carrier directives will
result in new towers built and owned by us and longterm leases for antenna
space on such towers however there are numerous factors that may prevent
carrier directives from resulting in leases including

     faa fcc or zoning restrictions that may prevent the building of a
      communication tower

     the results of the review of the business financial and legal aspects
      of the transactions conducted by us or our customers

     the lease price and

     the ability of the carriers who have awarded a directive to withdraw
      the directive

  as a result we cannot assure you as to the percentage of current and future
carrier directives that will ultimately result in constructed towers and
tenant leases

  we will need to seek additional financing to fund our business plan

  our business strategy contemplates substantial capital expenditures for the
expansion of our tower portfolio we intend to increase the number of towers
we own and lease by agreeing with wireless carriers to assume ownership or
control of their existing towers by pursuing buildtosuit opportunities and
by exploring other tower acquisition opportunities to the extent we are
unable to finance our future capital expenditures we will be unable to
achieve our currently contemplated business goals

  our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2000 were
4453 million we currently estimate that we will make at least 4000
million to 4500 million of cash capital expenditures during the year ending
december 31 2001 which will be primarily for the construction and
acquisition of towers tower companies andor related businesses this
estimate includes capital expenditures planned in connection with the

                                      16
page

telecorp and us unwired transactions we expect to fund 4000 million of
these planned capital expenditures from the proceeds from our 5000 million
10 14 senior notes offering completed in february 2001 that resulted in net
proceeds of 4842 million cash on hand and cash flow from operations in
addition we intend to seek a new senior credit agreement on terms no less
favorable to us than our prior senior credit facility thereafter however or
in the event we exceed our currently anticipated cash capital expenditures by
december 31 2001 we anticipate that we will need to seek additional equity
or debt financing to fund our business plan additional financing including a
new senior credit facility may not be available on commercially acceptable
terms or at all and additional debt financing may not be permitted by the
terms of our existing indebtedness including our 10 14 senior notes and 12
senior discount notes prior to march 1 2003 interest expense on our 12
senior discount notes will consist solely of noncash accretion of original
issue discount and will not require cash interest payments after that time
our 12 senior discount notes will have increased to 2690 million and will
require annual cash interest payments of approximately 323 million if we
are required to issue additional common equity to finance our capital
expenditures it could be dilutive to our existing shareholders

  managing our expansion and integrating acquisitions may strain our resources
and reduce our cash flow

  expanding our business may impose significant strains on our management
operating systems and financial resources the pursuit and integration of
newly constructed towers in addition to future acquisitions investments
joint ventures and strategic alliances will require substantial attention from
our senior management which will limit the amount of time available to devote
to our existing operations

  from january 1 2000 to december 31 2000 our work force increased from
approximately 600 to approximately 1000 employees this growth has placed
and will likely continue to place a substantial strain on our administrative
operational and financial resources in addition as part of our business
strategy we may acquire complementary businesses such as telecommunications
services companies or expand into new businesses acquisitions involve a
number of potential risks including the potential loss of customers and the
inability to productively combine disparate company cultures and facilities or
manage operating sites in geographically diverse markets we may not be able
to manage our growth successfully our management personnel or operational
and financial control systems may not be adequate to support expanded or
complementary operations any of these inabilities or inadequacies could cause
a significant increase in our expenses and reduce our cash flow

  we are subject to numerous regulations that may prevent delay or increase
the cost of building or operating towers

  extensive local state and federal regulations may prevent delay or
increase the cost of building or operating towers before we can build a new
tower either for a wireless communications carrier or for our own account we
must receive approval under local regulations local regulations include city
or other local ordinances zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants
imposed by community developers these regulations vary greatly but typically
require tower owners to obtain approval from local officials or community
standards organizations prior to tower construction in addition as the
concern over tower proliferation has grown in recent years certain
communities have placed restrictions on new tower construction or have delayed
granting permits required for construction if we cannot receive local
governmental approvals or if it is expensive or time consuming to obtain these
approvals then our results of operations will be negatively impacted

  both the fcc and faa regulate towers and other sites used for wireless
communications transmitters and receivers wireless communications devices
operating on towers are separately regulated and independently licensed based
upon the particular frequency used

  the construction or modification of communication sites is also subject to
the national environmental policy act which requires additional review of any
tower that may have a significant effect upon the quality of

                                      17
page

the human environment in addition the operation of our towers is subject to
federal state and local environmental laws and regulations regarding the use
storage disposal emission release and remediation of hazardous and non
hazardous substances materials or wastes under certain of these
environmental laws we could be held strictly liable for the remediation of
hazardous substance contamination at our facilities or at third party waste
disposal sites and could also be held liable for any personal or property
damage related to the contamination

  our estimates regarding our growth rate and our anticipated financial
performance include the costs of complying with these regulations as they
currently exist if new regulations are introduced or existing regulations are
modified it could increase our cost of operations and decrease our cash flow

  if demand for wireless communication services decreases our revenue will be
adversely affected

  substantially all of our customers to date have been providers of wireless
communications services if demand for wireless communication services
decreases our revenue growth will be and our revenue may be adversely
affected demand for both our site leasing and site development services is
dependent on demand for communication sites from wireless service providers
which in turn is dependent on the demand for wireless services a slowdown
in the growth of or reduction in demand in a particular wireless
communication segment could adversely affect the demand for communication
sites most types of wireless services currently require groundbased network
facilities including communication sites for transmission and reception the
extent to which wireless service providers lease these communication sites
depends on a number of factors beyond our control including

     the level of demand for wireless services

     the financial condition and access to capital of wireless service
      providers

     the strategy of wireless service providers with respect to owning or
      leasing communication sites

     government licensing of broadcast rights and

     changes in telecommunications regulations and general economic
      conditions

  in addition wireless voice service providers frequently enter into roaming
agreements with competitors allowing them to use anothers wireless
communications facilities to accommodate customers who are out of range of
their home providers services wireless voice service providers may view
these roaming agreements as a superior alternative to leasing antenna space on
communications sites owned or controlled by us the proliferation of these
roaming agreements could have a material adverse effect on our revenue

  we depend on a relatively small number of customers for most of our revenue

  we derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small number of
customers that vary at any given time particularly in the site development
services side of our business the loss of any significant customer could have
a material adverse effect on our revenue

  following is a list of significant customers and the percentage of total
revenues derived from such customers

  our site development customers engage us on a projectbyproject basis and
a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty
in addition a customers need for site development services can decrease and
we may not be successful in establishing relationships with new customers
moreover our existing customers may not continue to engage us for additional
projects

  due to the longterm expectations of revenue from tenant leases the tower
industry is very sensitive to the creditworthiness of its tenants wireless
service providers often operate with substantial leverage and financial
problems for our customers could result in uncollected accounts receivable in
the loss of customers and the associated lease revenues or in a reduced
ability of these customers to finance expansion activities in july 2000
pagenet one of our site leasing customers filed for bankruptcy for the year
ended december 31 2000 pagenet constituted less than 5 our total revenues
pagenet has continued to make all payments due to us under their lease
agreements

  if we commence international operations in the future it could strain our
resources and negatively affect our growth strategy and revenue

  we are currently evaluating international opportunities and we would like to
begin operating internationally if we find an opportunity we believe is
appropriate to pursue we may commence international operations at any time
initiating international operations may strain our resources and negatively
affect our growth strategy and revenue if we commence international
operations we will be subject to various political economic and other
uncertainties including

     difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international
      operations

     different technology standards

     fluctuations in currency exchange rates or the implementation of
      currency exchange controls

     political and economic instability

     unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and

     potentially adverse tax consequences

  any of these factors could delay or preclude our ability to generate revenue
in any international markets that we may enter accordingly we cannot assure
that if we begin international operations our strategies will prove to be
effective or that managements goals will be achieved

  our towers are subject to damage from natural disasters

  our towers are subject to risks associated with natural disasters such as
tornadoes hurricanes and earthquakes we maintain insurance to cover the
estimated cost of replacing damaged towers but these insurance policies are
subject to caps and deductibles we also maintain third party liability
insurance to protect us in the event of an accident involving a tower a tower
accident for which we are uninsured or underinsured or damage to a tower or
group of towers could require us to make significant capital expenditures and
may have a material adverse effect on our operations

  new technologies may have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and
results of operations

  the emergence of new technologies could reduce the demand for space on our
towers this could have a material adverse effect on our growth rate and
results of operations for example the fcc has granted license applications
for several lowearth orbiting satellite systems that are intended to provide
mobile voice and data services although these systems are highly capital
intensive and have only begun to be tested mobile satellite systems could
compete with landbased wireless communications systems in addition products
are currently being developed which may permit multiple wireless carriers to
use a single antenna or to increase the range and capacity of an antenna

have a material adverse effect on our business

  our business particularly site development services involves the delivery
of professional services and is laborintensive the loss of a significant
number of employees our inability to hire a sufficient number of qualified
employees or adequately develop and motivate the skilled employees we have
hired could have a material adverse effect on our business we compete with
other wireless communications firms and other enterprises for employees with
the skills required to perform our services we cannot assure you that we will

in the future or that we will continue to be successful in training retaining
and motivating employees

  our dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may negatively affect our
business

  we are a holding company with no business operations of our own our
dependence on our subsidiaries for cash flow may have a material adverse
effect on our operations our only significant asset is and is expected to be
the outstanding capital stock of our subsidiaries we conduct and expect to
conduct all of our business operations through our subsidiaries accordingly
our only source of cash to pay our obligations is distributions from our
subsidiaries of their net earnings and cash flow we currently expect that the
earnings and cash flow of our subsidiaries will be retained and used by them
in their operations including servicing their debt obligations except as
necessary to be distributed to us to cover holding company expenses including
interest payments on our 10 14 senior notes even if our subsidiaries
determined to make a distribution to us applicable state law and contractual
restrictions including any dividend covenants contained in any new senior
credit facility we may obtain in the future may restrict or prohibit these
dividends or distributions

  future issuances of our stock may cause dilution

  as part of the consideration for our acquisitions we sometimes agree to
issue additional shares of class a common stock if the towers or businesses
that we acquire meet or exceed certain earnings or new tower targets in the 1
3 years after they have been acquired as of december 31 2000 we had the
obligation to issue approximately 300000 additional shares of class a common

item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and
     results of operations

  we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications
towers in the united states we generate revenues from our two primary
businesses site leasing and site development in our site leasing business
we lease antenna space on towers and other structures that we own or manage
for others the towers that we own have either been built by us at the request
of a carrier or built or acquired based on our own initiative in our site
development business we offer wireless service providers assistance in
developing their own networks including designing a network with full signal
coverage identifying and acquiring locations to place their antennas
obtaining zoning approvals building towers when necessary and installing
their antennas since our founding in 1989 we have participated in the
development of more than 15000 antenna sites in 49 of the 51 major wireless
markets in the united states

site leasing services

  in 1997 we began aggressively expanding our site leasing business by
capitalizing on our nationally recognized site development experience and
strong relationships with wireless service providers to take

                                      23
page

advantage of the trends toward independent tower ownership and colocation
which is the placement of multiple antennas on one tower as of december 31
2000 we owned or controlled 2390 towers with 5548 tenants or 23 tenants
per tower in addition we had agreements to acquire 677 towers we also had
carrier directives to build over 600 additional towers and had in various
phases of development over 1000 locations which we had internally identified
as desirable locations on which to build a tower

  we believe our history and experience in providing site development services
gives us a competitive advantage in choosing the most attractive locations on
which to build new towers or buy existing towers as measured by our success
in increasing tower revenues and cash flows our same tower revenue growth at
december 31 2000 on the 1163 towers we owned as of december 31 1999 was
34 based on tenant leases signed and revenues annualized as of december 31
2000 we signed 261 new tenant leases in the quarter ended december 31 2000
on the 1950 towers we owned at the beginning of the quarter at an average
initial monthly rent of 1567 our annualized rate of tenants added per
tower on a broadband equivalent basis was 55 64 59 56 for each of the
last four quarters a broadband equivalent basis is calculated by dividing
total lease revenue by 1500 an industry benchmark for monthly tower rent
per tenant we believe that our annualized rate of new tenants added per tower
per quarter is among the highest in the industry

  we have focused our capital expenditures on building new towers and
acquiring existing towers in general we have chosen to build rather than buy
the substantial majority 65 of our towers because we believe the economics
of building are more favorable to date our average construction cost of a
new tower is approximately 250000 while we believe the industrys average
acquisition cost of a new tower over the last two years has been approximately
400000

  while we have focused primarily on building new towers for growth we have
also acquired 848 towers as of december 31 2000 we seek to acquire towers
where we can increase cash flow to substantially reduce the tower cash flow
multiple paid at acquisition through additional tenant leases the 848 tower
acquisitions to date were completed at an aggregate purchase price of 3239
million which averages to a price of approximately 382000 per tower in
addition to what we have already acquired we are actively negotiating to
acquire existing towers in september 2000 we entered into an agreement to
acquire 275 existing towers from telecorp pcs inc telecorp the
acquisition price of each tower will be 327500 the tower acquisition
agreement is subject to our satisfactory completion of our review of the
business financial and legal aspects of towers that may be acquired and
other items on march 16 2001 the company paid 665 million to purchase 203
towers under the telecorp agreement we anticipate that we will close on the
remaining 72 towers in the second quarter of 2001 in december 2000 we
entered into an agreement with us unwired to purchase a total of 300 towers
we purchased 127 towers in december 2000 and expect to purchase the remaining
173 towers in the second quarter of 2001 for approximately 541 million as
of december 31 2000 we had agreements to acquire 677 towers in 33 separate
transactions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately 2185 million
including the telecorp and us unwired agreements these acquisitions are
subject to a number of conditions and may or may not occur

site development services

  our site development business consists of two segments site development
consulting and site development construction through which we provide
wireless service providers a full range of endtoend services in the
consulting segment of our site development business we offer clients the
following services 1 network predesign 2 identification of potential
locations for towers and antennas 3 support in buying or leasing of the
location and 4 assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits in the
construction segment of our site development business we provide a number of
services including the following 1 tower and related site construction
2 switch construction and 3 antenna installation

  we believe that our total site development business will grow with the
expected overall growth of wireless and other telecommunications networks we
anticipate that site development construction revenues will continue

                                      24
page

to exceed site development consulting revenues we also believe that our site
leasing revenues will grow as wireless service providers continue to lease
antenna space on our towers and the number of towers we own or control grows

results of operations

  as we continue our transition into site leasing operating results in prior
periods may not be meaningful predictors of future prospects you should be
aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when
reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results we expect
that the acquisitions consummated to date and any future acquisitions as well
as our new tower builds will have a material impact on future revenues
expenses and net loss revenues cost of revenues selling general and
administrative expenses depreciation and amortization interest income and
interest expense each increased significantly in the year ended december 31
2000 as compared to 1999 and some or all of those items may continue to
increase significantly in future periods we believe that our new tower build
programs may have a material effect on future financial results which effect
will probably be negative until such time if ever as the newly constructed
towers attain higher levels of tenant use

year ended 2000 compared to year ended 1999

  total revenues increased 930 to 1679 million for 2000 from 870 million
for 1999 total site development revenue increased 913 to 1159 million in
2000 from 606 million in 1999 due to an increase in both site development
construction revenue and site development consulting revenue site development
construction revenue increased 1151 to 916 million for 2000 from 426
million for 1999 due to the inclusion of network services for an entire year
as well as higher levels of activity site development consulting revenue
increased 350 to 243 million for 2000 from 180 million for 1999 due to
the increased demand for site acquisition and zoning services from wireless
communications carriers site leasing revenue increased 968 to 520 million
for 2000 from 264 million for 1999 due to tenants added to our towers and
the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during 2000 as
compared to 1999

  total cost of revenues increased 869 to 1084 million for 2000 from 579
million for 1999 site development cost of revenue increased 939 to 889
million in 2000 from 458 million in 1999 due to higher site development
revenues site development consulting cost of revenue increased 258 to 156
million for 2000 from 124 million for 1999 reflecting higher site
development consulting revenues site development construction cost of revenue
increased 1192 to 732 million for 2000 from 334 million for 1999 due to
higher site development construction revenues which resulted primarily from
the inclusion of network services for an entire year site leasing cost of
revenue increased 607 to 195 million for 2000 from 121 million for 1999
due primarily to the increased number of towers owned

  gross profit increased to 595 million for 2000 from 291 million for
1999 due to increased site development and site leasing revenues gross
profit from site development increased 829 to 270 million in 2000 from
148 million in 1999 due to higher site development revenues gross profit
margins for site development decreased in 2000 to 233 from 244 in 1999 due
to a greater relative amount of lower margin site development construction
business gross profit margin on site development consulting increased to
356 for 2000 from 309 for 1999 this increase is attributable to a change
in the mix of our business to include more multipurpose projects producing
both site development revenue and buildtosuit towers gross profit margin on
site development construction decreased to 201 for 2000 from 216 in 1999
due to an increase in the use of subcontractor labor gross profit for the
site leasing business increased 1275 in 2000 from 541 in 1999 the
increased gross profit was due to the substantially greater number of towers
owned and the greater average revenue per tower in the 2000 period the
increase in gross margin was due to additional tenants added to our towers and
the resulting increase in average revenue per tower which was greater than
the increase in average expenses as a percentage of total revenues gross
profit increased to 354 of total revenues in 2000 from 334 in 1999 due
primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit

  selling general and administrative expenses increased 405 to 278
million for 2000 from 198 million for 1999 the increase in selling general
and administrative expenses represents the addition of offices personnel and
other infrastructure necessary to support our continued growth as well as
increased developmental expenses associated with our higher levels of new
tower builds and acquisition activities as a percentage of total revenue
selling general and administrative expenses decreased to 166 for 2000 from
227 in 1999

  depreciation and amortization increased to 348 million for 2000 as
compared to 166 million for 1999 this increase was directly related to the
increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 2000 as
compared to 1999

  operating loss decreased to 31 million for the year ended 2000 from
73 million in 1999 as a result of the increased gross profit in 2000
other expense net decreased to 246 million for the year ended 2000 from
264 million for the year ended 1999 the decrease is attributable to
higher interest income on increased cash balances which more than offset an
increase in interest expense the increase in interest expense is due to
increased interest associated with the senior credit facility amortization of
deferred financing charges and original issue discount partially offset by
increased interest capitalization as a result of increased construction
activity the extraordinary item in 1999 of 11 million relates to the
writeoff of deferred financing fees associated with a prior bank credit
agreement net loss was 289 million for the year ended 2000 as compared to
net loss of 339 million for the year ended 1999

year ended 1999 compared to year ended 1998

  total revenues increased 472 to 870 million for 1999 from 591 million
for 1998 total site development revenue increased 297 to 606 million in
1999 from 467 million in 1998 due to an increase in site development
construction revenue which more than offset a decline in site development
consulting revenue site development construction revenue increased 1213 to
426 million for 1999 from 193 million for 1998 due to the acquisition of
network services on april 30 1999 as well as higher levels of activity site
development consulting revenue decreased 346 to 180 million for 1999 from
274 million for 1998 due primarily to the decreased demand for site
acquisition and zoning services from pcs licensees as well as the increasing
acceptance by wireless carriers of outsourced communication site
infrastructure through buildtosuit programs where site acquisition and
zoning services are provided by the tower owner site leasing revenue
increased 1132 to 264 million for 1999 from 124 million for 1998 due to
a substantial number of revenue producing towers added during the period
through new builds and acquisitions as well as the addition of new tenants on
existing towers

obligations in fiscal year 2000 and beyond in connection with leases that were
rejected in 1999 as part of the bankruptcy litigation of conxus

  gross profit increased 902 to 291 million for 1999 from 153 million
for 1998 due to the increase in both site development gross profit and site
leasing gross profit gross profit for site development construction services
increased 957 to 92 million for 1999 from 47 million for 1998 due to
higher revenue gross profit for site development consulting services
decreased 01 to 55 million for 1999 from 54 million for 1998 the lower
gross profit margins experienced in 1999 on site development consulting
services were due to more work being performed on a fixed fee basis and the
completion of a number of large projects on which we experienced
proportionately higher expenses than in the earlier stages of a project gross
profit for the site leasing business increased 1793 to 143 million for
1999 from 51 million for 1998 due primarily to higher revenue but also due
to higher gross profit margins earned on towers owned as opposed to the
margins earned on our leasesublease business which contributed most of our
1998 site leasing revenue as a percentage of total revenues gross profit
increased to 329 for 1999 as compared to 259 for 1998 due to a greater
percentage of gross profit coming from higher margin site leasing revenues

  selling general and administrative expenses increased 82 to 198 million
for 1999 from 183 million for 1998 primarily due to the addition of
personnel the expansion of office space and overall increases in operating
expenses attributable to the growth in the organization and building of our
tower development infrastructure as a percentage of total revenues selling
general and administrative expenses decreased to 227 for 1999 from 310 in
1998

  depreciation and amortization increased to 166 million for 1999 as
compared to 58 million for 1998 this increase was directly related to the
increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in 1999 as
compared to 1998

  operating loss decreased to 73 million for 1999 from 88 million for
1998 as a result of the factors discussed above other income expense
increased to 264 million for 1999 from 126 million for 1998 this
increase resulted primarily from the full year of interest expense associated
with the 12 senior discount notes and higher average credit facility balances
in 1999 and less interest income earned in 1999 on cash balances net loss
was 339 million for 1999 as compared to net loss of 225 million for
1998

liquidity and capital resources

  sba communications corporation is a holding company with no business
operations of its own our only significant asset is the outstanding capital
stock of our subsidiaries we conduct all of our business operations through
our subsidiaries accordingly our only source of cash to pay our obligations
other than financings is distributions with respect to our ownership interest
in our subsidiaries from the net earnings and cash flow generated by these
subsidiaries even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution
of the capital stock of our subsidiaries we cannot assure you that our
subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend distribute
funds pay interest or principal on the 10 14 senior notes entered into in
2001 or the 12 senior discount notes or that we will be permitted to pay any
dividends under the terms of any new debt facility

  net cash provided by operations during the year ended december 31 2000 was
475 million as compared to 231 million in 1999 this increase was
primarily attributable to the increase in revenues net cash used in investing
activities for year ended december 31 2000 was 4453 million compared to
2089 million for the year ended december 31 1999 this increase was
primarily attributable to a higher level of tower acquisitions and new build
activity in 2000 versus 1999 net cash provided by financing activities for
the year ended december 31 2000 was 4096 million compared to 1621 million
for the year ended december 31 1999 the increase in net cash provided by
financing activities in 2000 was attributable to our equity offerings of class
a common stock which closed in february and august 2000 and borrowings under
our revolving credit facility

  our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of 275 million as
of december 31 2000 and negative working capital of 209 million as of
december 31 1999 this is primarily due to the timing of certain accrued
expenses related to our business operations and our use of a revolving credit
facility to satisfy short term liquidity needs as opposed to carrying large
cash balances

  in february 2000 we completed an offering of 90 million shares of our
class a common stock we raised gross proceeds of 2430 million which
produced net proceeds of approximately 2295 million after deduction of the
underwriting discount and offering expenses we used 705 million of these
net proceeds to repay all revolving credit loans under the senior credit
facility remaining proceeds were used for the construction and acquisition of
towers and for general working capital purposes additionally in february
2000 the managing underwriters of the offering exercised and closed on their
overallotment option to purchase an additional 14 million shares of our
class a common stock from certain shareholders we did not receive any
proceeds as a result of this exercise


                                      28

  in july 2000 we filed a universal shelf registration statement on form s3
registering the sale of up to 5000 million of any combination of the
following securities class a common stock preferred stock debt securities
depositary shares or warrants in august 2000 we completed an offering under
this universal shelf of 58 million shares of our class a common stock
including shares issued upon the exercise of the overallotment option we
raised gross proceeds of 2473 million which produced net proceeds of
approximately 2360 million after deduction of the underwriting discount and
offering expenses we used 250 million of these net proceeds to repay a
portion of the term loans under the senior credit facility remaining proceeds
were used for the construction and acquisition of towers and general working
capital purposes as of the date of this report we may issue any combination
of the registered securities with an aggregate offering price of up to 2527
million under this universal shelf registration statement

  in february 2001 the company closed on 5000 million 10 14 senior notes
due 2009 which produced net proceeds of approximately 4842 million after
deducting offering expenses the company used 1050 million of these proceeds
to repay all borrowings under the senior credit facility and terminated the
senior credit agreement on march 16 2001 the company used 665 million of
the remaining proceeds to purchase 203 towers under the telecorp agreement we
intend to use approximately 236 million of the remaining proceeds to
purchase the remaining 72 towers under the telecorp agreement and
approximately 541 million to purchase 173 towers from us unwired remaining
proceeds will be used to finance the construction and acquisition of
additional towers and related businesses and for general working capital
purposes interest on these notes is payable on february 1 and august 1 of
each year beginning august 1 2001 the 10 14 senior notes are unsecured
and are pari passu in right of payment with the companys other existing and
future senior indebtedness the 10 14 senior notes place certain
restrictions on among other things the incurrance of debt and liens
issuance of preferred stock payment of dividends or other distributions sale
of assets transactions with affiliates sale and leaseback transactions
certain investments and our ability to merge or consolidate with other
entities

  our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december 31 2000 were
4453 million and for the year ended december 31 1999 were 2089 million
we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year
ending december 31 2001 of at least 4000 million to 4500 million
including up to 1750 million for the acquisition of up to 548 towers we may
acquire from telecorp and us unwired substantially all of these planned
capital expenditures are expected to be funded by the proceeds of our 5000
million 10 14 senior note offering completed in february 2001 cash on hand
and cash flow from operations the exact amount of our future capital
expenditures will depend on a number of factors including acquisition
opportunities that become available during the period the needs of our build
tosuit customers and the availability to us of additional debt or equity
capital on acceptable terms in the event that we do not have sufficient
liquidity when an acquisition or construction opportunity arises we would be
required to seek additional debt or equity financing failure to obtain any
such financing could require us to significantly reduce our planned capital
expenditures and scale back the scope of our tower construction activities or
acquisitions either of which could have a material adverse effect on our
projected financial condition or results of operations in addition we may
need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness including our 10 14
senior notes and our 12 senior discount notes on or prior to scheduled
maturity our ability to make scheduled payments of principal or to pay
interest on our debt obligations and our ability to refinance any such debt
obligations including the 10 14 senior notes or the 12 senior discount
notes or to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our future
performance which to a certain extent is subject to general economic
financial competitive legislative regulatory and other factors that are
beyond our control

  we have on file with the securities and exchange commission shelf
registration statements on form s4 registering up to a total of 3000000
shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the
acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related
services at various locations in the united states during the year ended
december 31 2000 we issued 723246 shares of class a common

                                      29

stock under these registration statements in connection with ten acquisitions
as of december 31 2000 we had 2276754 shares of class a common stock
remaining on these shelf registration statements

  in addition to the issuance under the shelf registration statements on
september 30 2000 we issued 400000 restricted shares of class a common
stock to the former shareholders of network services in accordance with the
terms of the acquisition agreement

  at december 31 2000 our senior credit facility as amended consisted of a
500 million term loan and a 2250 million revolving line of credit
availability under the senior credit facility was determined by a number of
factors including the number of towers built by us with anchor tenants on the
date of completion the financial performance of our towers the financial
performance of our site development segment as well as by other financial
covenants financial ratios and other conditions at december 31 2000 we had
the 500 million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility at a
1006 variable rate and 250 million outstanding under the revolving credit
facility at a 1075 variable rate in the first quarter of 2001 we used
proceeds from the issuance of the 10 14 senior notes to repay all amounts
outstanding under the senior credit facility and terminated the facility

  accordingly the company wrote off deferred financing fees related to the
senior credit facility and will record a 48 million extraordinary loss in
the first quarter of 2001 in connection with the termination of this facility
at december 31 2000 we had 2090 million outstanding on our 12 senior
discount notes net of unamortized original issue discount of 600 million
the 12 senior discount notes mature on march 1 2008

inflation

  the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date
however we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will
not adversely affect our operating results

of the accompanying consolidated financial statements is as follows

  a basis of consolidation

  the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company
and all of its whollyowned subsidiaries all significant intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation

  b use of estimates

  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting periods the more significant estimates made
by management include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the
costs and revenue relating to the companys site development and construction
contracts valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and the economic useful
lives of towers actual results could differ from those estimates

deposits or investments with original maturities of three months or less and
highly liquid shortterm commercial paper

  d property and equipment

            notes to consolidated financial statements continued

  interest is capitalized in connection with the construction of towers the
capitalized interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and
is amortized over the assets estimated useful life approximately 35
million and 16 million of interest cost was capitalized in 2000 and 1999
respectively

  e intangible assets

  intangible assets are comprised of costs paid in excess of the fair value of
assets acquired goodwill and amounts paid related to covenants not to
compete deferred financing fees and deferred lease costs goodwill is being
amortized over periods which range from 7 to 40 years the covenants not to
compete are being amortized over the terms of the contracts which range from
1 to 10 years amortization expense was 36 million 11 million and 03
million for the years ended december 31 2000 1999 and 1998 respectively
accumulated amortization totaled approximately 50 million and 14 million
at december 31 2000 and 1999

  f deferred financing fees

  financing fees related to the issuance of longterm debt and the 12 senior
discount notes and the related original issue discount on the 12 senior
discount notes have been deferred and are being amortized using a method that
approximates the effective interest rate method over the length of
indebtedness to which they relate

  g deferred lease costs

  the company defers certain initial direct costs associated with new leases
and amortizes these costs over the initial lease term generally five years
total costs deferred were approximately 11 million in both 2000 and 1999

  h impairment of longlived assets

  statement of financial accounting standards no 121 sfas 121 accounting
for the impairment of longlived assets and for longlived assets to be
disposed of requires that longlived assets including certain identifiable
intangibles and the goodwill related to those assets be reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of the asset in question may not be recoverable management
has reviewed the companys longlived assets and has determined that there are
no events requiring impairment loss recognition

  the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have
occurred that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of intangible
assets or whether the remaining balance of intangible assets should be
evaluated for possible impairment the company uses an estimate of the related
undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the intangible assets in
assessing whether an impairment occurred the company measures impairment loss
as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value
of the assets

  i fair value of financial instruments

  the carrying value of the companys financial instruments which includes
cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable prepaid expenses notes
receivable accounts payable accrued expenses and notes payable approximates
fair value due to the short maturity of those instruments the companys 12
senior discount notes are publicly traded and were trading based on an 1181
yield at december 31 2000 indicating a fair value of the notes of
approximately 2112 million the carrying value of the discount notes is
approximately 2090 million at december 31 2000

  j revenue recognition

  revenue from tower leasing is recorded monthly on a straightline basis over
the life of the related lease agreements revenue for leasing is recorded on a
monthly basis at billed contractual amounts rental amounts received in
advance are recorded in other liabilities

            notes to consolidated financial statements continued

  site development projects in which the company performs consulting services
include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis time
and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services
are rendered for those site development contracts in which the company
performs work on a fixed price basis site development billing and revenue
recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project
on a per site basis upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis
the company recognizes the revenue related to that phase revenue related to
services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not
recorded by the company at the end of the reporting periods presented as it
was not material to the companys results of operations any estimated losses
on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the
loss becomes evident site development projects generally take from 3 to 12
months to complete

  revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentageof
completion method of accounting determined by the percentage of cost incurred
to date compared to managements estimated total anticipated cost for each
contract this method is used because management considers total cost to be
the best available measure of progress on the contracts these amounts are
based on estimates and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is
reduced as work on the contracts nears completion the asset costs and
estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents
expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed the
liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted
contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized
  in december 1999 the securities and exchange commission issued staff
accounting bulletin no 101 sab 101 revenue recognition in financial
statements sab 101 provides guidance on the recognition presentation and
disclosure of revenue in financial statements the companys revenue
recognition policy is in accordance with the provisions of sab 101 adoption

consolidated financial position

  costs of site development project revenue and construction revenue include
all direct material costs salaries and labor costs including payroll taxes
subcontract labor vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the
projects all costs related to site development projects and construction
projects are recognized as incurred costs of site leasing revenue include
rent maintenance and other tower expenses provisions for estimated losses on
uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are
determined to be probable

  k selling general and administrative expenses

  selling general and administrative expenses represent those costs incurred
which are related to the administration or management of the company also
included in this category are corporate development expenses which represent
costs incurred in connection with proposed acquisitions and new build
activities where a capital asset is not produced and expansion of the
customer base the above costs are expensed as incurred

  l income taxes

  the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of
statement of financial accounting standards no 109 accounting for income
taxes sfas no 109 sfas no 109 requires the company to recognize
deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future income tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in the companys consolidated
financial statements deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based
on the temporary differences between the consolidated financial statements
carrying amounts and the tax base of assets and liabilities using enacted tax
rates in the years in which the temporary

            notes to consolidated financial statements continued
differences are expected to reverse in assessing the likelihood of
utilization of existing deferred tax assets management has considered
historical results of operations and the current operating environment

  m reclassifications

  certain reclassifications have been made to the 1999 and 1998 consolidated
financial statements to conform to the 2000 presentation

  n loss per share

  basic and diluted loss per share are calculated in accordance with statement
of financial accounting standards no 128 earnings per share the company has
potential common stock equivalents related to its outstanding stock options
these potential common stock equivalents were not included in diluted loss per
share because the effect would have been antidilutive accordingly basic and
diluted loss per common share and the weighted average number of shares used
in the computations are the same for all periods presented there were 31
million 32 million and 17 million options outstanding at december 31 2000
1999 and 1998 respectively the computation of basic and fully diluted loss
per share is as follows



                                         for the years ended december 31

operations

3 current accounting pronouncements

no 138 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging
activities an amendment of sfas 133 sfas 133 established accounting and
reporting standards for derivative instruments including certain derivative
instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities sfas 138
addresses a limited number of issues causing implementation difficulties for
numerous entities that apply sfas 133 and amends the accounting and reporting
standards of sfas 133 for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging
activities the company has elected to defer the adoption of both sfas 133 and
sfas 137 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
deferral of the effective date of sfas no 133 until fiscal 2001 the
company adopted sfas 138 on january 1 2001 and there was not a significant
impact from the adoption

  in february 2001 the fasb issued a revised exposure draft entitled
business combinations and intangibles assets  accounting for goodwill
this exposure draft if adopted as proposed would eliminate the amortization
of goodwill against earnings instead it would be written down against
earnings only in the periods in which the recorded value of the goodwill is
more than its fair value the fasb is expected to issue a final statement on
business combinations and intangible assets in 2001 the adoption of this
statement if issued as proposed would not have a material impact on our
consolidated results of operations

portion of the senior credit facility was increased to 750 million and was
fully funded at closing the revolving loan portion of the senior credit
facility was increased to 2250 million

factors including number of towers built by the company with anchor tenants
on the date of completion the financial performance of the companys towers
site development and construction segments as well as by other financial
covenants financial ratios and other conditions the initial term loan of
250 million and the 2250 million revolving loan were to mature december

the senior credit facility plus a margin ranging from 125 to 250
determined by a leverage ratio the senior credit facility was secured by
substantially all of the assets of telecommunications and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries required telecommunications to maintain certain
financial covenants and placed restrictions on among other things the
incurrence of debt and liens dispositions of assets transactions with
affiliates and certain investments

incur indebtedness pay dividends create liens sell assets and engage in
certain mergers and acquisitions the ability of the company to comply with
the covenants and other terms of the 12 senior discount notes and to satisfy
