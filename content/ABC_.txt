industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by iqvia an independent thirdparty provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 45 from 2021 through 2026 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population the number of individuals aged 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 66 million by 2026 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics and biosimilars has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic and biosimilar usage a favorable trend because generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

legislative developments in 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers subsequent legislation and rules promulgated by government agencies have made additional changes to federal drug payment policies these policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or

government regulation 

we are subject to extensive oversight by united states united kingdom and european union governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” the us department of justice and various other federal and state authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and false claims act the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the false claims act prohibits knowingly submitting or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government and authorizes treble damages and substantial civil penalties in the case of violations the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the supply chain security legislation known as the drug quality and security act “dqsa” became law in 2013 title ii of the dqsa known as the drug supply chain security act “dscsa” establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot

level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and requires all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dscsa also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers the fda and eventually all comparable state agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and thirdparty logistics providers there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with dqsa requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance these and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations 

the regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the united states including those related to the importation and reimportation of certain drugs from foreign markets can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services in addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate certain of our distribution centers which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

any future reductions in medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition

in june 2021 we extended to 2029 our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which walgreens boots alliance development gmbh “wbad” provides a variety of services including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf this reflected our continued expectation that partnering strategically with wba will result in various benefits including continued cost savings and initiatives designed to create incremental growth and efficiencies in sourcing logistics and distribution we also entered into a distribution agreement pursuant to which we will supply branded and generic pharmaceutical products to wba’s boots uk ltd subsidiary through 2031 the processes needed to achieve and maintain these initiatives and benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangements on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the potential inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the extension of the duration of our distribution agreement for walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services agreement with wbad and the respective terms thereunder including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility potential changes in supplier relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to walgreens pharmacies in the united states or to pharmacies operated by boots uk ltd in the united kingdom including changes necessitated by changing market conditions or other unforeseen developments that may arise during the term of either distribution agreement to the extent that any such changes are not offset by other financial benefits that we are able to obtain through collaboration in other aspects of our strategic relationship with wba and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with wba in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship 

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated march 18 2013 and the amended and restated amerisourcebergen shareholders agreement dated june 1 2021 as further amended on august 2 2022 the “shareholders agreement” to make certain additional investments in our common stock wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholders agreement subject to certain restrictions on the number of shares that may be sold at any given time for example in november 2022 wba sold 132 million shares of our common stock any sales of common stock by wba could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased

costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve any of our objectives the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba in the united states and the united kingdom if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason deemed within our control we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of our distribution agreement for walgreens pharmacies our distribution agreement with boots uk ltd or our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all 

our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by the covid19 pandemic natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability moreover if the economic benefits we are able to obtain through the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba decline due to changes in market conditions or other changes impacting the fees and rebates that generic manufacturers make available through the arrangement our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

as part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations on june 1 2021 we completed our acquisition of alliance healthcare from wba for 55967 million in net cash 2291 million of the our common stock and 61 million of other equity consideration see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements on september 12 2022 we announced our intent to acquire pharmalex holding gmbh “pharmalex” for €1280 million in cash subject to certain customary adjustments the pharmalex transaction is expected to close by march 2023 and is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions including receipt of required regulatory approvals alliance healthcare and pharmalex operate in the united kingdom germany a number of other countries in the european union and in select other markets we may find that our ability to integrate and control alliance healthcare and pharmalex is more difficult time consuming or costly than expected especially in certain countries where our investment is not whollyowned such as our 50owned alliance healthcare egypt subsidiary each of alliance healthcare and pharmalex may fail to achieve its expected future financial and operating performance and results and the acquisitions may have the effect of disrupting relationships with employees suppliers and other business partners 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses or in regions in which we lack operational or market experience acquired companies may have business practices that we are not accustomed to or have unique terms and conditions with their business partners as a result of the acquisition of alliance healthcare and other future acquisitions including pharmalex our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions our businesses operate in a number of jurisdictions including egypt and other locations that have a higher business operating and regulatory risk profile than the united states and european union jurisdictions such risks may include risks of violation of united states united kingdom and other anticorruption antibribery and international trade laws our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are not able to effectively put in place effective financial controls and compliance policies to safeguard against such risks as part of our integration of businesses including alliance healthcare

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives further divestitures may be delayed due to failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or may become more difficult to execute due to conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction the impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

we conduct operations in over 50 countries which subjects us to various risks inherent in global operations we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition as well as business and operational decisions made by joint venture partners for example during fiscal 2022 turkey became a “highly inflationary economy” as defined under us gaap which impacted our consolidated financial statements 

furthermore geopolitical dynamics caused by political economic social or other conditions in foreign countries and regions may impact our business and results of operations during fiscal 2022 we have experienced increased costs including for fuel and it is possible that we could experience supply disruptions or shortages if tariffs or other protective measures are enacted significantly higher and sustained rates of inflation with subsequent increases in operational costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response thereto or any other current or future acts of terrorism war such as the ongoing russia and ukraine war and other events such as economic sanctions and trade restrictions including those related to the ongoing russia and ukraine war may cause further disruptions to the economies of the united states and other countries and create further uncertainties or could otherwise negatively impact our business operating results and financial condition 

changes or uncertainty in us policies or policies in other countries and regions in which we do business including any changes or uncertainty with respect to us or international trade policies or tariffs also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business in various currencies including the us dollar the euro the uk pound sterling the turkish lira the egyptian pound the brazilian real and the canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in us dollars we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place any of these risks might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we might be adversely impacted by the january 2020 withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union 

we have continued to expand our operations in the united kingdom and the european union and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions associated with the united kingdoms withdrawal from the european union “brexit” we continue to believe brexit could adversely affect political regulatory economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets for example we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our united kingdom operations as well as sourcing disruptions and associated pricing volatility customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by brexit any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations similar future trade disruptions or disputes could have a negative impact on our operations in the united kingdom and european union and other parts of the world 

we are subject to operational and logistical risks that might not be covered by insurance 

we have distribution centers and facilities located in the united states the united kingdom the european union and throughout the world our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and the provision 

table of contents 

of related services including cold chain storage and shipping the volume of cold chain storage and shipping has increased in part due to the covid19 pandemic and the requirements for distribution of covid19 vaccines and certain treatments we expect this trend to continue although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage coverage on acceptable terms might be unavailable coverage might not cover our losses coverage might be significantly more costly or may require large deductibles 

additionally we seek to maintain coverage for risks associated with cybersecurity but such insurance has become increasingly difficult to secure and in some cases policies may not provide adequate coverage for possible losses uninsured losses or operational losses that result from large deductible payments under commercial insurance coverage might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees including key executives and other talent is essential for us to meet our objectives we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes such as illness and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles employees might not successfully transition into new roles any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

additionally approximately 28 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements nearly all of whom are employees located outside of the united states we believe that our relationship with our employees is good but if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

industry and economic risks 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes 

our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products in the united states generally use wholesale acquisition cost “wac” as the reference price we sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using wac as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price if manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to wac or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our results of operations could be adversely affected additionally there are a number of us government policy initiatives being considered which if enacted could directly or indirectly regulate or impact wac prices if such initiatives are passed or finalized and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers andor customers our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation additionally certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows whether due to regulatory mandates the implementation of legislative proposals policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the “competition” section the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition the healthcare industry continues to experience increasing consolidation including through the formation of strategic alliances among pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies healthcare providers and health insurers which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business continued consolidation within the healthcare industry could adversely affect our results of operations to the extent we experience reduced negotiating power or possible customer losses 

table of contents 

our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has led to a general worsening of economic conditions which has put financial pressure on many of our customers and may threaten certain customers’ ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to repay their obligations to us as they become due the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations as of september 30 2022 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 38 and 7 of accounts receivable net 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions pending litigation and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations furthermore the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier could have an adverse effect on the supply or availability of products which may cause supply chain disruptions and increases in the price of substitutes or alternatives 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings 

if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing impair our liquidity or adversely impact our business 

additionally rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities to maintain our ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries or regions where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions whether due to covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability negative trends in the general economy including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flows from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions or increases in inflation may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries or regions where we do business deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected

litigation and regulatory risks 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states as well as in the other countries and regions in which we do business is highly regulated at many levels of government there have been increasing efforts in the united states by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health the fda dea and tsa and by similar regulators in the united kingdom the european union and other countries to regulate the pharmaceutical supply chain regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system as well as provide assurance over the integrity of products traversing the supply chain consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various laws which include operating record keeping and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some governments have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution 

at the federal level in the united states the dscsa establishes national traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and requires all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system by november 2023 the dscsa also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers the fda and eventually all comparable state agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and thirdparty logistics providers most recently on february 4 2022 the fda issued a proposed rule which when finalized will establish the national standards for the licensure of wholesale drug distributors and thirdparty logistics providers 

failure to comply with the dqsa requirements or with additional similar governmental regulatory and licensing requirements may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance our international operations may also be subject to local regulations containing recordkeeping and other obligations related to our distribution operations in those locations for example in 2019 the safety features of the falsified medicines directive became operational in eu member states which consists of placing a unique identifier a twodimensional barcode and an antitampering device on the outer packaging of medicines pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs and could have an adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states in addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution prescribing and dispensing of these drugs 

complying with the dqsa requirements including the dscsa requirements and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution requirements including followon actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined or regulating pricing contracting and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services additionally on occasion price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of governmental inquiries national federal and state investigations and private litigation any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement such as pricing controls or indexing models at a national federal or state level could adversely affect our operations 

in the european union many governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs in most eu member states for example the government regulates pricing of a new pharmaceutical product at launch often through direct price controls international price comparisons controlling profits andor reference pricing some european governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending such as volume discounts cost caps cost sharing for increases in excess of prior year costs for individual products or aggregated market level spending outcomebased pricing schemes and free products for a portion of the expected therapy period all of these measures exert pressure on the 

table of contents 

pricing and reimbursement levels for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices 

in the united states federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the affordable care act “aca” became law in march 2010 and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting medicare and medicaid reimbursement pricing and contracting for prescription drugs including changes to the medicaid rebate statute we cannot predict the impact that any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca may have on the aca or other healthcare legislation and regulation 

subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies including the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which increased the medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

more recently on august 16 2022 president biden signed into law the inflation reduction act “ira” an omnibus budget law which contains significant reforms affecting prescription drug pricing and reimbursement these reforms include i manufacturer inflation rebates on drugs covered under medicare part b and medicare part d to the extent such products’ prices increase faster than the rate of consumer price inflation beginning in the fourth quarter of 2022 for part d drugs and the first quarter of 2023 for part b drugs ii limits on medicare part b and part d patients’ cost sharing for insulin beginning in 2023 iii medicare part d benefit redesign beginning in 2024 including replacement of the “coverage gap discounts” that pharmaceutical manufacturers currently pay with new mandatory manufacturer discounts applicable during all phases of the part d benefit after satisfaction of the deductible beginning in 2025 and iv federal price negotiation of “maximum fair prices” for certain “selected” highexpenditure drugs under medicare parts d and b applicable beginning in 2026 for part d drugs and 2028 for part b drugs under which maximum fair prices must be made available to pharmacies physicians and other entities dispensing or providing drugs covered under medicare parts d and b although the primary effects of the ira reforms will be felt by manufacturers these changes may impact our customer pricing structures our manufacturer distribution relationships and revenue our customers billing processes and reimbursement amounts and drug prices more generally including outside of the medicare context among other issues the mechanisms by which maximum fair prices will be made available to pharmacies physicians and other purchasers of selected drugs and our associated role and responsibilities remain to be determined more broadly the law contains reimbursement and pricing incentives designed to promote biosimilar introduction and competition which may affect our customers’ selection of products each of these considerations as well as other issues that may arise in connection with the implementation of the ira may adversely affect our operations and profitability 

our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians hospitals community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under part b of the medicare program the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” published a final rule in november 2017 that reduces medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug discount program from average sales price “asp” plus 6 to asp minus 225 with certain exceptions effective january 2018 subsequently cms issued proposed rules for later years containing similar reductions in hospital outpatient payments for 340b drugs in june 2022 the united states supreme court ruled in american hospital association v becerra that cms’s final rule was inconsistent with the medicare statute and was therefore invalid following the supreme court’s decision cms published a proposed rule for the calendar year 2023 hospital outpatient payment system which did not propose a specific “refund” mechanism to implement reimbursement provisions consistent with the supreme court’s decision but advised the public that the final rule is likely to include such a mechanism and solicited comments on particular approaches while the court’s decision if fully implemented by cms removes the reimbursement restrictions for 340b products affecting our customers and indirectly the company there can be no assurance that recent or future rules established by cms will not have an adverse impact on our business 

further even where a government does not affirmatively change drug price regulation standards other parties in the drug manufacturing and distribution system may change their interpretation or approach to implementing or complying with those standards in a manner that may adversely affect our business for example the 340b drug discount program requires manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient drugs to “covered entity” safety net providers and previous health resources and services administration “hrsa” guidance has allowed covered entities to dispense 340b discounted drugs through arrangements with multiple “contract pharmacies” recently several manufacturers have announced initiatives that may inhibit or limit covered entities’ ability to use any or multiple contract pharmacies may place conditions on the use of contract 

table of contents 

pharmacies or direct us not to honor 340b discounted pricing requests on orders to be shipped to contract pharmacies or may not honor chargebacks where such discounts are extended to contract pharmacies since these manufacturer policies were first announced both manufacturers and covered entities have filed lawsuits against hrsa regarding the contract pharmacy policy which are currently pending in several federal district and appellate courts and hrsa has also advised certain manufacturers that it was referring their policies to the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services for potential civil money penalty enforcement proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings our customers include covered entities and organizations with significant participation as contract pharmacies and the unavailability of 340b discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements may adversely affect such customers and therefore could adversely affect our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to medicare drug pricing regulations such as asp calculations or the extension of ira pricing reforms to commercial health plans could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare medicaid or other insurance payment or policy changes if adopted would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

finally federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as medicare and medicaid which may adversely affect our business for example several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs on july 31 2019 the department of health and human services announced a “safe importation action plan” that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets following this framework the fda proposed a draft rule in december 2019 that would allow importation of certain lowercost prescription drugs from canada and in september 2020 the rulemaking was finalized by the fda along with an industry guidance document under the rule states or certain other nonfederal governmental entities would be able to submit importation program proposals to the fda for review and authorization of twoyear programs with the opportunity to extend for two more years the new rule became effective on november 30 2020 although its implementation has been delayed and its impact is uncertain in part because lawsuits have been filed challenging the government’s authority to promulgate it further authorities in canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the canadian drug supply from shortages despite the ongoing litigation on july 9 2021 president biden signed an executive order pertaining to drug pricing that directs the commissioner of the fda to work with states and indian tribes to facilitate the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from canada in march 2022 fda met with representatives from colorado florida maine new mexico and vermont to provide assistance in developing importation proposals if implemented importation of drugs from canada may materially and adversely affect our business the regulatory and market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs if enacted could decrease the price we receive for products and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability 

there can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs or to government drug price regulation programs such as the medicaid rebate asp or 340b program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the us federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca many states have enacted similar statutes which are not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to certain 

table of contents 

incentives offered in connection with sales of pharmaceutical products and related services are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to administrative civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal state or governmental healthcare programs 

our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings 

due to the nature of our operations which we conduct through a variety of businesses including the distribution of pharmaceuticals the dispensing of healthcare products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in government investigations legal disputes or proceedings these investigations disputes or proceedings have involved or may involve healthcare fraud and abuse the false claims act antitrust class action commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing public disclosures and various other claims including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the risk factor below 

litigation is inherently unpredictable and the unfavorable outcome of legal proceedings could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to ordinary business operations the defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition violations of various laws including with respect to the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs any settlement judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

statutory andor regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of brand andor generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

in fiscal 2018 we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term failure to comply with obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties 

opioidrelated legal proceedings and the comprehensive settlement agreement that we have entered into could adversely impact our cash flows or results of operations 

on july 21 2021 we announced that amerisourcebergen and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement that would result in the resolution of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities the “settlement agreement” on april 2 2022 the settlement agreement became effective and as of september 30 2022 it included 48 of 49 eligible states the “settling states” as well as 99 by population of the eligible political subdivisions in the settling states pursuant to the settlement agreement and related agreements with settling states we will pay up to approximately 64 billion over 18 years and comply with other requirements including establishment of a clearinghouse that will consolidate data from all three national distributors the settlement agreement does not contemplate participation by any nongovernmental or nonpolitical entities or individuals our estimated liability related to the state of alabama with whom we have not reached a settlement agreement as well as other opioidrelated litigation for which we have reached settlements agreements is approximately 04 billion 

net of 08 billion of payments made through september 30 2022we have a 60 billion liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2022 for litigation relating to the settlement agreement as well as other opioidrelated litigation we currently estimate that 5287 million will be paid prior to september 30 2023 which is recorded in accrued expenses and other on our consolidated balance sheet the remaining longterm liability of 55 billion is recorded in accrued litigation liability on our consolidated balance sheet while we have accrued an estimated liability for opioid litigation we are unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with the matters that are not included in the settlement accrual because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur the 

table of contents 

assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events and the amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from the amount accrued to date until such time as otherwise resolved we will continue to litigate and prepare for trial and to vigorously defend ourself in all such matters since these matters are still developing we are unable to predict the outcome but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders further details on the settlement agreement and opioid litigation are provided in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business 

certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain including pharmaceutical manufacturers national retail pharmacy chains independent pharmacies prescribers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the manufacture dispensing and distribution of opioid medications in addition a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain by state and local governmental entities and other plaintiffs for claims related to the company’s distribution of opioid medications the lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future and lawsuits could be brought against the company by other plaintiffs under other theories related to opioid abuse we are deeply committed to diversion control efforts have sophisticated systems to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious including through the use of data analytics and engage in due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers in addition to the claims brought by states and other local governmental entities we are also being sued by private plaintiffs such as unions other health and welfare funds hospital systems third party payors other healthcare providers and individuals alleging personal injury for the same activities and continue to be named as a defendant in additional lawsuits 

in april 2022 the settlement agreement described above which settles the vast majority of opioidrelated lawsuits filed against us by state and local governmental entities became effective the settlement agreement includes a cash component pursuant to which we will pay up to approximately 64 billion the majority of which we expect to be paid over 18 years the settlement agreement also includes injunctive relief terms relating to distributors’ controlled substance antidiversion programs including with respect to i governance ii independence and training of the personnel operating controlled substances monitoring programs iii due diligence for new and existing customers iv ordering limits for certain products and v suspicious order monitoring a monitor will oversee compliance with these provisions for a period of five years in addition the distributors will engage a thirdparty vendor to act as a clearinghouse for data aggregation and reporting which the distributors will fund for ten years it is possible that the implementation and maintenance of the required changes to distributors’ controlled substance antidiversion programs may result in unforeseen costs or operational challenges which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or performance 

legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict certain jurisdictions have enacted and others are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states if additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

ongoing unfavorable publicity regarding the abuse or misuse of prescription opioid pain medications and the role of wholesale distributors in the supply chain of such prescription medications as well as the continued proliferation of the opioid lawsuits investigations regulations and legislative actions and unfavorable publicity in relation to those lawsuits could continue to have a material adverse effect on our reputation or results of operations 

tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities in august 2022 the us inflation reduction act of 2022 was signed into law this law among other 

table of contents 

things provides for a corporate alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income and an excise tax on corporate stock repurchases we are continuing to evaluate the impact this new law may have on our financial position and results of operations in addition there are several proposed changes to us and nonus tax legislation which if enacted could have a negative impact on our effective tax rate foreign governments may enact tax laws that could result in further changes to global taxation that could materially affect our financial position and results of operations in addition we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes these examinations may result in unforeseen taxrelated liabilities which may harm our future financial results 

an increasing number of states and foreign jurisdictions have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new taxes on all or a portion of gross revenue or other similar amounts or impose additional obligations to collect transaction taxes such as sales consumption value added or similar taxes we may not have sufficient lead time to build systems and processes to collect these taxes properly or at all failure to comply with such laws or administrative practices or a successful assertion by such states or foreign jurisdictions requiring us to collect taxes where we do not could result in material tax liabilities including for past sales as well as penalties and interest 

there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives both within the united states and other foreign jurisdictions in which we operate in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations while we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows 

violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the “fcpa” us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market we may also have substantial liability if a third party acting on our behalf or on the behalf of our subsidiaries including our joint venture partners is in violation of these laws the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses we have business operations in many countries worldwide including business operations in egypt through our 50owned alliance healthcare egypt subsidiary as well as brazil and turkey and other countries that are considered to have business environments with higher risk of conduct that could give rise to potential violations and liabilities from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our actual or perceived failure to adequately protect personal data could result in claims of liability against us damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business 

given the nature of our business we together with third parties acting on our behalf receive collect process use and retain sensitive and confidential customer and employee data in addition to proprietary business information some of our thirdparty service providers such as identity verification and payment processing providers also regularly have access to customer data additionally we maintain other confidential proprietary or otherwise sensitive information relating to our business and from third parties 

global privacy cybersecurity and data protectionrelated laws and regulations are evolving extensive and complex compliance with these laws and regulations is difficult and costly the interpretation and application of these laws in some 

table of contents 

instances is uncertain and our legal and regulatory obligations are subject to frequent changes we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the united states and beyond that regulate the collection use security processing and transfer of personal data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals many foreign data privacy regulations including without limitation gdpr in the european union uk gdpr brazil’s general data protection law lgpd and the personal information protection and electronic documents act in canada and certain state laws and regulations including california’s ccpa and recently enacted consumer privacy laws in colorado connecticut utah and virginia impose requirements beyond those enacted under united states federal law including in some instances private rights of action for example the eu gdpr imposes more stringent data protection requirements including a broader scope of protected data restrictions on crossborder transfers of personal data and more onerous breach reporting requirements and the eu gdpr imposes greater penalties for noncompliance than the federal data protection laws in the united states other states and countries continue to enact similar legislation we are also required to comply with expanding and increasingly complex cybersecurity regulations in the united states and abroad with respect to reporting adverse events and additional requirements for avoiding or responding to an adverse event we may also face audits or investigations by domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties we also have contractual obligations to our customers related to the protection of personal data and compliance with privacy laws the foregoing or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position 

other risks 

the loss or disruption of information systems could disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers we continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems including but not limited to those relating to our acquisition of alliance healthcare to the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail or to the extent there are data center interruptions or outages our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a thirdparty service provider does not perform satisfactorily or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloudbased infrastructure and other services new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks security incidents such as ransomware attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe as well as increasingly difficult to detect these risks have increased with the growth of our business including as we integrate the information systems of acquired businesses such as alliance healthcare into our enterprise 

in addition security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses we and our thirdparty service providers may experience cyberattacks aimed at disrupting services security breaches can also occur as a result of nontechnical issues including intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees thirdparty service providers or their personnel or other parties a failure interruption or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our thirdparty service providers as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data damage our reputation cause loss of customers or revenue increase our costs result in litigation andor regulatory action andor cause other losses any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures controls and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate information security vulnerabilities 

our failure to protect our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 

we believe that maintaining and enhancing our reputation is critical to our ability to expand and retain our customer base strategic partnerships and other key relationships any negative publicity about us or the industry in which we operate we offer may adversely impact our business and operations furthermore failure to comply with ethical social product labor health and safety accounting or environmental standards could also jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various 

table of contents 

adverse actions including litigation negative claims or publicity including those made on social media also could adversely affect our reputation and business regardless of whether such claims are accurate 

our reputation may also depend on the success of our environmental social and governance “esg” initiatives inclusive of sustainability social impact and corporate responsibility which require companywide coordination and alignment risks associated with these initiatives include increased focus on esg targets goals and disclosure including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations increased costs associated with sustainability efforts and compliance with laws and regulations all of the foregoing could expose us to market operational and execution costs or risks any esg or sustainability metrics that we currently or may in the future disclose whether based on the standards we set for ourselves or those set by others may influence our reputation and the value of our brands there is also increased focus including by investors customers and other stakeholders on esg matters including the use of materials climate change waste generation supply chain human capital health equity and worker safety our reputation could be damaged if we do not or are perceived to not act responsibly with respect to sustainability matters which could also have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and cash flows 

we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics and the ongoing covid19 pandemic has had adverse effects on our business 

we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics including risks related to any responses thereto by the federal state or foreign governments as well as customers and suppliers the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations supply chains and distribution network and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in supply and demand for certain of our products and services further it is possible that the manufacturers that produce the products that we distribute may experience delays or shutdowns due to covid19 such as from disruptions in their supply chains or in a suspension of production at their own facilities accordingly we expect the impacts of the ongoing covid19 pandemic to adversely affect the supply of products andor potentially disrupt our ability to deliver products to customers the implementation of any governmentmandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees any extended disruption in our ability to service our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

our management of the impact of covid19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees as well as resources across our global enterprise this may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments which may adversely impact our future results of operations in addition issues relating to the covid19 pandemic may result in legal claims or litigation against us we also face risks related to a downturn in our customers’ respective businesses including the operations of retail pharmacy and health systems customers due to covid19 an economic slowdown or recession related to covid19 may affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their business on acceptable terms which could in turn result in reduced spending 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including the resurgence of covid19 and its variants in regions recovering from the impacts of the pandemic the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines and the speed at which populations are vaccinated around the globe the impact of covid19 on economic activity and regulatory actions taken to contain the impact of covid19 on public health and the global economy we have implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and have protocols in place to address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations but a widespread or sustained outbreak of covid19 at one or more locations could disrupt our ability to service our customers or attract and retain the necessary workforce the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this risk factors section any of which could have a material effect on us 

our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets may become impaired which may require us to record a further significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us generally accepted accounting principles “gaap” require us to test our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant negative industry or economic trends including rising interest rates or a significant decline in our stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible and longlived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our longlived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value the testing required by gaap involves estimates and judgments by management 

table of contents 

for example as a result of a prolonged decline in profarma’s stock price we performed an impairment assessment over our profarma reporting unit as of june 30 2022 as a result of the june 30 2022 interim test we recorded a 759 million impairment to goodwill in fiscal 2022 we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets or longlived assets is determined any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

natural disasters or other unexpected events including those related to climate change may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be covered by insurance 

we continue to focus on strategies and systems such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and packaging waste to address climate change however we face climate and environmental risks and the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes drought storms sea level rise floods and other severe hazards or accidents in the united states the united kingdom the european union or in other countries or regions in which we operate could adversely affect our operations and financial performance extreme weather natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers andor disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination further the longterm effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear and changes in the supply demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services including natural resources necessary to run our businesses any longterm disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations

revenue 



our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars price inflation and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states and europe competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other thirdparty reimbursement rates to our customers changes in government rules and regulations foreign currency conversion rates and the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

revenue increased by 115 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to our june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare and the revenue growth of our us healthcare solutions segment 

the us healthcare solutions segment grew its revenue by 96 billion or 48 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth and increased sales to specialty physician practices offset in part by a decline in sales of covid19 treatments primarily commercial treatments 

more specifically the increase in the us healthcare solutions segment revenue was largely attributable to the following in billions 



the continued decline of sales relating to covid19 treatments and fees earned from the distribution of governmentowned covid19 treatments could adversely impact our results of operations 

revenue in international healthcare solutions increased by 150 billion or 1298 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare 

a number of our contracts with customers including group purchasing organizations are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 no significant contracts expired in january 2022 we extended our agreement with express scripts through september 2026 over the next twelve months there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire additionally from time to time significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended renewed or replaced prior to their expiration dates if those contracts are extended renewed or replaced at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowances for returns and credit losses 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for credit losses our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends the allowance for returns as of september 30 2022 and 2021 was 15321 million and 12716 million respectively 

we evaluate our receivables for risk of loss by grouping our receivables with similar risk characteristics expected losses are determined based on a combination of historical loss trends current economic conditions and forwardlooking risk factors changes in these factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for credit losses the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for expected credit losses and specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for credit losses net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 was 261 million 121 million and 119 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2022 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 185 million the allowance for credit losses was 947 million and 851 million as of september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure beginning with our operating segments we aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics which include the similarity of longterm gross margins the nature of the components products services and production processes the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers and the components regulatory environment we announced a strategic reorganization of our business and began reporting externally under the new structure as of october 1 2021 as of september 30 2022 our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services us consulting services mwi alliance healthcare innomar world courier and profarma 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively such qualitative factors can include among others industry and market conditions overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events if we conclude based on its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value it performs a quantitative analysis we elected to perform a quantitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2022 we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2021 with the exception of our testing of goodwill in the amerisourcebergen consulting services the sum of us consulting services and innomar reporting units under our prior reporting structure and profarma reporting units we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in fiscal 2020 with the exception of our testing of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in the mwi and profarma reporting units 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

when performing a quantitative impairment assessment we utilize an incomebased approach to value our reporting units with the exception of the profarma reporting unit the fair value of which is based upon its publiclytraded stock price plus an estimated control premium the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our forecasted cash flows and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows andor market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of 

table of contents 

the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinitelived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 and 2020 we recorded goodwill impairments of 759 million and 64 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2022 and 2021 impairment tests respectively see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and no indefinitelived intangible asset impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 2021 or 2020 

finitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we perform a recoverability assessment of our longlived assets when impairment indicators are present 

we recorded impairments of intangible and tangible assets totaling 3617 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 in connection with the permanent shutdown of our compounding business 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based upon the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 218 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2022

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 66 of our inventories as of september 30 2022 and 2021 has been determined using the lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 13834 million and 13162 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30 2022 and 2021 respectively we recorded lifo expense of 672 million and 74 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2022 and 2020 respectively we recorded a lifo credit of 2030 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 the annual lifo provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences changes in inventory 

table of contents 

quantities and product mix many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision 

loss contingencies

table of contents 

the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments as of september 30 2022 



the 2017 tax act required a onetime transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits we expect to pay 1571 million net of overpayments and tax credits related to this transition tax as of september 30 2022 which is payable in installments over a sixyear period that commenced in january 2021 the transition tax commitment is included in other commitments in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 5532 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2022 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table our liability for uncertain tax positions as of september 30 2022 primarily includes an uncertain tax benefit related to the 68 billion legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications as disclosed in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

market risk 

we have exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the uk pound sterling the euro the turkish lira the egyptian pound the brazilian real and the canadian dollar during the quarter ended march 31 2022 turkey became a highly inflationary economy as defined under us gaap see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements also with the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare our foreign currency and exchange rate risk increased therefore we now use forward contracts to hedge against the foreign currency exchange rate impact on certain intercompany receivable and payable balances we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes revenue from our foreign operations during the fiscal year ended september 30 2022 was approximately 11 of our consolidated revenue 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we had 7461 million of variablerate debt outstanding as of september 30 2022 we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want andor on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30 2022 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 33882 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2022 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

deterioration of general economic conditions among other factors could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

recent elevated levels of inflation in the global and us economies have not had a significant impact on our results of operations if elevated levels of inflation persist or increase our operations and financial results could be adversely affected particularly in certain global markets

increased use of generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics and biosimilars has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic and biosimilar usage a favorable trend because generic and biosimilar pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework agreement dated march 18 2013 and the amended and restated amerisourcebergen shareholders agreement dated june 1 2021 to make certain additional investments in our common stock wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholders agreement subject to certain restrictions on the number of shares that may be sold at any given time any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion 

table of con t ents 

of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve any of our objectives the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba in the united states and the united kingdom if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason deemed within our control we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of our distribution agreement for walgreens pharmacies our distribution agreement with boots uk ltd or our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all 

our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by the covid19 pandemic natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability moreover if the economic benefits we are able to obtain through the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba decline due to changes in market conditions or other changes impacting the fees and rebates that generic manufacturers make available through the arrangement our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

as part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations as previously announced on june 1 2021 we completed our acquisition of alliance healthcare from wba for 66020 million in cash subject to certain purchase price adjustments 2291 million of the companys common stock 2 million shares at the companys june 1 2021 opening stock price of 11454 per share 969 million of estimated accrued consideration and 61 million of other equity consideration see note 2 of the notes to consolidated financial statements alliance healthcare operates in the united kingdom a number of countries in the european union and in select other markets we may find that our ability to integrate and control alliance healthcare is more difficult time consuming or costly than expected especially in certain countries where our investment is not whollyowned such as our 50owned alliance healthcare egypt subsidiary alliance healthcare may fail to achieve its expected future financial and operating performance and results and the acquisition may have the effect of disrupting relationships with employees suppliers and other business partners 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses or in regions in which we lack operational or market experience acquired companies may have business practices that we are not accustomed to or have unique terms and conditions with their business partners as a result of the acquisition of alliance healthcare and other future acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions alliance healthcare operates in a number of jurisdictions including egypt and other locations that have a higher business operating and regulatory risk profile than the united states and european union jurisdictions such risks may include risks of violation of united states united kingdom and other anticorruption antibribery and international trade laws our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we are not able to effectively put in place effective financial controls and compliance policies to safeguard against such risks as part of our integration of alliance healthcare 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives further divestitures may be delayed due to failure to obtain required approvals on a timely basis if at all from governmental authorities or may become more difficult to execute due to 

table of con t ents 

conditions placed upon approval that could among other things delay or prevent us from completing a transaction or otherwise restrict our ability to realize the expected financial or strategic goals of a transaction the impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50 countries we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition as well as business and operational decisions made by joint venture partners 

changes or uncertainty in us policies or policies in other countries and regions in which we do business including any changes or uncertainty with respect to us or international trade policies or tariffs also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we might be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 

we conduct our business in various currencies including the us dollar the euro the uk pound sterling the turkish lira the egyptian pound the brazilian real and the canadian dollar changes in foreign currency exchange rates could reduce our revenues increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our financial results reported in us dollars we may from time to time enter into foreign currency contracts foreign currency borrowings or other techniques intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exchange rate risks these hedging activities may not completely offset the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign currency exchange rates during the time the hedges are in place any of these risks might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position results of operations or cash flows 

we might be adversely impacted by the withdrawal of the united kingdom from the european union 

we have operations in the united kingdom and the european union and face risks associated with the uncertainty and potential disruptions associated with the united kingdom withdrawing from the european union “brexit” brexit could adversely affect political regulatory economic or market conditions and contribute to instability in global political institutions regulatory agencies and financial markets for example we might experience volatility in exchange rates and interest rates and changes in laws regulating our united kingdom operations as well as sourcing disruptions and associated pricing volatility customers might reduce purchases due to the uncertainty caused by brexit any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we are subject to operational and logistical risks that might not be covered by insurance 

we have distribution centers and facilities located in the united states the united kingdom the european union and throughout the world our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and the provision of related services including with respect to cold chain storage and shipping the volume of cold chain storage and shipping has increased due to the covid19 pandemic and the requirements for distribution of covid19 vaccines and certain treatments we expect this trend to continue in the near term although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage coverage on acceptable terms might be unavailable or coverage might not cover our losses or may require large deductibles 

additionally we seek to maintain coverage for risks associated with cybersecurity but such insurance has become increasingly difficult to secure and in some cases policies may not provide adequate coverage for possible losses uninsured losses or operational losses that result from large deductible payments under commercial insurance coverage might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

we might be unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified employees 

our ability to attract engage develop and retain qualified and experienced employees including key executives and other talent is essential for us to meet our objectives we compete with many other businesses to attract and retain employees competition among potential employers might result in increased salaries benefits or other employeerelated costs or in our failure to recruit and retain employees we may experience sudden loss of key personnel due to a variety of causes such as illness and must adequately plan for succession of key management roles employees might not successfully transition into new roles any of these risks might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

table of con t ents 

additionally approximately 27 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements a large majority of which are alliance healthcare employees located outside of the united states we believe that our relationship with our employees is good but if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

industry and economic risks 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes 

in fiscal 2021 we continued to experience less favorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings we expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2022 which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products in the united states generally use wholesale acquisition cost wac as the reference price we sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using wac as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price if manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to wac or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our results of operations could be adversely affected additionally there are a number of us government policy initiatives being considered which if enacted could directly or indirectly regulate or impact wac prices if such initiatives are passed or finalized and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers andor customers our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation additionally certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows whether due to regulatory mandates the implementation of legislative proposals policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the competition section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies and health insurers which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business if we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services 

our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has led to a general worsening of economic conditions which has put financial pressure on many of our customers and may threaten certain customers’ ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to repay their obligations to us as they become due the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations as of september 30 2021 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 38 and 6 of accounts receivable net 

  

table of con t ents 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions pending litigation and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings 

if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing impair our liquidity or adversely impact our business 

additionally rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities to maintain our ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries or regions where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions whether due to covid19 or otherwise could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability negative trends in the general economy including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flows from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions or increases in inflation may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries or regions where we do business deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

litigation and regulatory risks 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states as well as in the other countries and regions in which we do business is highly regulated at many levels of government there have been increasing efforts in the united states by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health the fda dea and tsa and by similar regulators in the united kingdom the european union and other countries to regulate the pharmaceutical supply chain regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various laws which include operating record keeping and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some governments have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution 

at the federal level in the united states the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system by november 2023 the dqsa and in 

table of con t ents 

particular title ii of the dqsa the drug supply chain security act dscsa also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers 

failure to fully comply with the dqsa requirements including the dscsa requirements or with additional similar governmental regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance our international operations may also be subject to local regulations containing recordkeeping and other obligations related to our distribution operations in those locations for example in 2019 the safety features of the falsified medicines directive became operational in eu member states which consists of placing a unique identifier a twodimensional barcode and an antitampering device on the outer packaging of medicines pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs and could have an adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states in addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution prescribing and dispensing of these drugs 

complying with the dqsa requirements including the dscsa requirements and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution requirements including followon actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined or regulating pricing contracting and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services additionally on occasion price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of governmental inquiries national federal and state investigations and private litigation the united states congress is currently considering proposals to allow centralized negotiation of manufacturer prices based on indexing models in the context of certain government programs any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement such as pricing controls or indexing models at a national federal or state level could adversely affect our operations 

in the united states federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the affordable care act aca became law in march 2010 and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting medicare and medicaid reimbursement pricing and contracting for prescription drugs including changes to the medicaid rebate statute given the scope of the changes made by the aca and continuing implementation controversies we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca may have on the aca or other healthcare legislation and regulation 

subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies including the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which increased the medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

in the european union many governments provide or subsidize healthcare to consumers and regulate pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility and reimbursement levels in order to control government healthcare system costs in most eu member states for example the government regulates pricing of a new pharmaceutical product at launch often through direct price controls international price comparisons controlling profits andor reference pricing some european governments have implemented or are considering austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending such as volume discounts cost caps cost sharing for increases in excess of prior year costs for individual products or aggregated market level spending outcomebased 

table of con t ents 

pricing schemes and free products for a portion of the expected therapy period all of these measures exert pressure on the pricing and reimbursement levels for pharmaceuticals and may cause our customers to purchase fewer of our products and services or influence us to reduce prices 

our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians hospitals community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under part b of the medicare program the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms published a final rule in november 2017 that reduces medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug discount program from average sales price asp plus 6 to asp minus 225 with certain exceptions effective january 2018 in july 2020 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia reversed the district court’s decision which would allow the payment reductions to take effect the united states supreme court has agreed to review the decision with a decision expected sometime in 2022 while the appeals process is still underway cms solicited comments in the proposed calendar year 2020 medicare outpatient prospective payment system rule on appropriate payment for such 340bacquired drugs and finalized a rule in november 2019 that would impose the same asp minus 225 rate that was the subject of the litigation described above more recently in august 2020 cms proposed further reductions such that net payments would be based on an asp minus 287 rate separately november 2018 cms published a final rule that reduces from 6 to 3 the “addon” payment for new separatelypayable part b drugs and biologicals that are paid based on wac when asp data during first quarter or sales is unavailable there can be no assurance that recent or future rules established by cms will not have an adverse impact on our business 

further even where a government does not affirmatively change drug price regulation standards other parties in the drug manufacturing and distribution system may change their interpretation or approach to implementing or complying with those standards in a manner that may adversely affect our business for example the 340b drug discount program requires manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient drugs to “covered entity” safety net providers and previous health resources and services administration “hrsa” guidance has allowed covered entities to dispense 340b discounted drugs through arrangements with multiple “contract pharmacies” recently several manufacturers have announced initiatives that may inhibit or limit covered entities’ ability to use any or multiple contract pharmacies and may direct us not to honor 340b discounted pricing requests on orders to be shipped to contract pharmacies or may not honor chargebacks where such discounts are extended to contract pharmacies hrsa has initially indicated that it lacks regulatory authority to enforce its prior guidance allowing multiple contract pharmacies but recently advised that it is considering whether it may have other enforcement remedies in the event that manufacturers do not extend 340b discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements since these manufacturer policies were first announced both manufacturers and covered entities have filed lawsuits against hrsa regarding the contract pharmacy policy which are currently pending and in september 2021 hrsa advised certain manufacturers that it was referring their policies to the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services for potential civil money penalty enforcement proceedings we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings our customers include covered entities and organizations with significant participation as contract pharmacies and the unavailability of 340b discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements may adversely affect such customers and therefore could adversely affect our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to medicare drug pricing regulations such as asp calculations could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

finally federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as medicare and medicaid which may adversely affect our business for example several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs on july 31 2019 the department of health and human services announced a “safe importation action plan” that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets following this framework the fda proposed a draft rule in december 2019 that would allow importation of certain lowercost prescription drugs from canada and in september 2020 the rulemaking was finalized by the fda along with an industry guidance document under the rule states or certain other nonfederal governmental entities would be able to submit importation program proposals to the fda for review and authorization of twoyear programs with the opportunity to extend for two more years the new rule became effective on november 30 2020 although its implementation has been delayed and its impact is uncertain in part because lawsuits have been filed challenging the government’s authority to promulgate it further authorities in canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the canadian drug supply from shortages despite the ongoing litigation on july 9 2021 president biden signed an executive order pertaining to drug pricing that directs the commissioner of the fda to work with states and indian tribes to facilitate the commercial importation of certain prescription drugs from canada if implemented importation of drugs from canada may materially and adversely affect our business the regulatory and market implications of the final rule and guidance are unknown at this time proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under 

table of con t ents 

certain circumstances legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs if enacted could decrease the price we receive for products and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability 

there can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs or to government drug price regulation programs such as the medicaid rebate asp or 340b program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the us federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca many states have enacted similar statutes which are not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to certain incentives offered in connection with sales of pharmaceutical products and related services are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to administrative civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal state or governmental healthcare programs 

public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business 

certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain including pharmaceutical manufacturers national retail pharmacy chains independent pharmacies prescribers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the manufacture dispensing and distribution of opioid medications in addition a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the pharmaceutical supply chain by state and local governmental entities and other plaintiffs for claims related to the company’s distribution of opioid medications the lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future and lawsuits could be brought against the company by other plaintiffs under other theories related to opioid abuse we are deeply committed to diversion control efforts have sophisticated systems to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious including through the use of data analytics and engage in due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways including through increased costs and harm to our re putation 

  legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict certain jurisdictions have enacted and others are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states if additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

failure to finalize the proposed settlement agreement and settlement process could negatively affect our business 

on july 21 2021 we announced that amerisourcebergen and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement that if all conditions are satisfied would result in the resolution of 

table of con t ents 

a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities the proposed settlement agreement and settlement process is subject to conditions and will not become effective unless and until we and the two other distributors each make separate independent determinations that 1 following a 30day signon period a sufficient number of “states” including the district of columbia and us territories have agreed to the proposed settlement agreement the “settling states” and subsequently 2 following a 120day signon period a sufficient number of political subdivisions in the settling states including those that have not sued have agreed to the proposed settlement agreement or otherwise had their claims foreclosed on september 4 2021 we announced that amerisourcebergen and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors had determined that enough states had agreed to proceed to the next phase of the settlement agreement process further details on the status of a global resolution of the multidistrict opioid litigation involving c ertain state and local governmental entities and other related state court litigation are provided in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements while a global settlement with respect to certain governmental entities within the multidistrict litigation mdl and other related state court litigation remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward we believe a global settlement is probable and its liability related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of september 30 2021 we recorded a charge of 66 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 related to the proposed global settlement and other related opioid litigation and recorded an additional 1477 million accrual in the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 in connection with the proposed settlement agreement and related obligations and other opioidrelated litigation until such time as a plaintiff participates in a global settlement or otherwise resolves its lawsuit we will continue to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the mdl those remanded from the mdl to federal district courts as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all such cases since these matters are still developing we are unable to predict the outcome but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts andor injunctive relief including changes to our antidiversion programs that may affect how we operate our business further any final settlement amongst parties may differ materially from our advanced discussions related to global resolution of the mdl the inability to reach a global settlement of the mdl and adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders 

our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings 

we conduct our operations through a variety of businesses including the distribution of pharmaceuticals the dispensing of healthcare products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings these disputes or proceedings have involved or may involve healthcare fraud and abuse the false claims act antitrust class action commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing public disclosures and various other claims including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to ordinary business operations the defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition violations of various laws including with respect to the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs any settlement judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

statutory andor regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of brand andor generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

  in fiscal 2018 we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term failure to comply with obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties 

tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives such as corporate tax rate and law changes the repeal of lastin firstout lifo us tax 

table of con t ents 

treatment or the promulgation of state opioid taxes and fees may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives both within the united states and other jurisdictions in which we operate in addition tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations while we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows 

violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses we have business operations in many countries worldwide including business operations in egypt through our 50owned alliance healthcare egypt subsidiary as well as turkey ukraine brazil and other countries that are considered to have business environments with higher risk of conduct that could give rise to potential violations and liabilities from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the united states and beyond that regulate the collection use security processing and transfer of personal data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals many foreign data privacy regulations including without limitation gdpr in the european union uk gdpr brazils general data protection law lgpd and the personal information protection and electronic documents act in canada and certain state laws and regulations including californias ccpa impose requirements beyond those enacted under united states federal law including in some instances private rights of action for example the eu gdpr imposes more stringent data protection requirements including a broader scope of protected data restrictions on crossborder transfers of personal data and more onerous breach reporting requirements and the eu gdpr imposes greater penalties for noncompliance than the federal data protection laws in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties we also have contractual obligations to our customers related to the protection of personal data and compliance with privacy laws the foregoing or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position 

other risks 

we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics and the continued spread of covid19 has had adverse effects on our business 

we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics including risks related to any responses thereto by the federal state or foreign governments as well as customers and suppliers the covid19 pandemic has adversely affected our operations supply chains and distribution network and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in supply and demand for certain of our products and services further it is possible that the 

table of con t ents 

manufacturers that produce the products that we distribute may experience delays or shutdowns due to covid19 such as from disruptions in their supply chains or in a suspension of production at their own facilities accordingly we expect the continued spread of covid19 to adversely affect the supply of products andor potentially disrupt our ability to deliver products to customers the implementation of any government mandated vaccination or testing mandates may impact our ability to retain current employees and attract new employees for example the federal occupational safety and health administration issued an emergency temporary standard requiring employers with at least 100 employees to require their employees to get vaccinated or submit to regular covid19 testing any extended disruption in our ability to service our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

we also face risks related to our employees health and the impact it may have on operations certain of our employees have contracted covid19 which resulted in our decision to temporarily close and subsequently reopen a small number of our distribution centers in the first half of fiscal year 2021 in accordance with our internal protocols we have implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and have protocols in place to address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations but a widespread or sustained outbreak of covid19 at one or more locations could disrupt our ability to service our customers 

we also face risks related to a downturn in our customers respective businesses including the operations of our retail pharmacy and health systems customers due to covid19 an economic slowdown or recession related to covid19 may affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their business on acceptable terms which could result in reduced spending on our products and services 

the impacts of the continued spread of covid19 could also cause other unpredictable events each of which could adversely affect our business revenue results of operations cash flows or financial condition for example the continued spread of covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets a sustained or prolonged outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact of such events and the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a to our form 10k any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 

risks generally associated with our information systems and cyber security may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers we continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems including but not limited to those relating to our recent acquisition of alliance healthcare to the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail or to the extent there are data center interruptions our business and results of operations may be adversely affected our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a thirdparty service provider does not perform satisfactorily or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloudbased infrastructure and other services new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks these risks have increased with the growth of our business including as we integrate the information systems of alliance healthcare into our enterprise a failure interruption or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our thirdparty service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data damage our reputation cause loss of customers or revenue increase our costs result in litigation andor regulatory action andor cause other losses any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations in addition security incidents may require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures controls and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities

revenue 



we expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the highsingle to lowdouble digits in fiscal 2022 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars price inflation and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states and europe competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other thirdparty reimbursement rates to our customers changes in government rules and regulations and the impact of the covid19 pandemic 

revenue increased by 127 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment and our june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare 

the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 86 or 157 billion from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales of specialty products which generally have higher selling prices including covid19 treatments and overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth 

more specifically the increase in the pharmaceutical distribution services segment revenue was largely attributable to the following in billions 



revenue in other increased 1123 or 84 billion from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare and due to growth in the other operating segments mwi abcs and world courier

gross profit increased 337 or 17513 million from the prior fiscal year gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in other and pharmaceutical distribution services a lifo credit in the current year period in comparison to a lifo expense in the prior year period and an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements 

pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 123 or 4709 million from the prior fiscal year due to revenue growth including an increase in specialty product sales as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 217 in the current fiscal year increased 7 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in specialty product sales including covid19 treatments 

gross profit in other increased 634 or 8875 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare and revenue growth at world courier and mwi as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 1432 in the current fiscal year decreased from 1860 in the prior fiscal year the decline in gross profit margin in the current fiscal year was primarily due to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare which has a lower gross profit margin than the other operating segments within other 

we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of 1688 million and 91 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our cost of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences changes in inventory quantities and product mix many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision the lifo credit in the current fiscal year was largely driven by an increase in generic pharmaceutical deflation 

in the prior fiscal year we incurred remediation costs in connection with the suspended production activities at pharmedium we also incurred shutdown costs in connection with permanently exiting the pharmedium compounding business 

new york state nys enacted the opioid stewardship act osa which went into effect on july 1 2018 the osa established an annual 100 million opioid stewardship fund the fund and required manufacturers distributors and importers licensed in nys to ratably source the fund the ratable share of the assessment for each licensee was to be based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within nys in december 2018 the osa was ruled unconstitutional by the us district court for the southern district of new york in september 2020 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the district court’s decision and as a result we accrued 148 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 related to our ratable share of the assessment

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased 299 or 8270 million from the prior fiscal year the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare and an increase in payrollrelated operating costs to support current and future revenue growth as a percentage of revenue distribution selling and administrative expenses were 168 in the current fiscal year and represents a 22basis point increase compared to the prior fiscal year the increase in distribution selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare

interest expense net 

interest expense net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows 



interest expense net increased 262 or 362 million from the prior fiscal year due to the issuance of our 1525 million of 0737 senior notes 1000 million of 2700 senior notes in march 2021 and the 500 million variablerate term loan that was issued in june 2021 all of which were used to finance a portion of the june 2021 acquisition of alliance

healthcare the incremental interest expense associated with alliance healthcares debt in certain countries and the decrease in interest income resulting from a decrease in investment interest rates the increase in interest expense as a result of the abovementioned debt issuances was offset in part by a lower weightedaverage borrowing interest rate and the repayment of our 400 million term loan upon its maturity in october 2020 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

income tax expense benefit 

our effective tax rates were 305 and 358 in the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 was higher than the us statutory rate due to uk tax reform see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 was higher than the us statutory rate due to our operating loss the tax benefits associated with our decision to permanently exit the pharmedium compounding business swiss tax reform the cares act and other discrete items and offset in part by the tax impact of the portion of the opioid legal accrual that is not expected to be tax deductible 

net income loss attributable to amerisourcebergen corporation and diluted earnings per share 

net income attributable to amerisourcebergen and diluted earnings per share were significantly lower in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the legal accrual recognized in connection with opioid lawsuits

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowances for returns and credit losses 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for credit losses our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends the allowance for returns as of september 30 2021 and 2020 was 12716 million and 13446 million respectively 

we evaluate our receivables for risk of loss by grouping our receivables with similar risk characteristics expected losses are determined based on a combination of historical loss trends current economic conditions and forwardlooking risk factors changes in these factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for credit losses the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for expected credit losses and specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for credit losses net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 was 121 million 119 million and 252 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2021 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 183 million the allowance for credit losses was 851 million and 727 million as of september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively

schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and credit losses 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure beginning with our operating segments we aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics which include the similarity of longterm gross margins the nature of the components products services and production processes the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers and the components regulatory environment our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services profarma abcs world courier mwi and alliance healthcare 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively such qualitative factors can include among others industry and market conditions overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events if we conclude based on its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value it performs a quantitative analysis we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 with the exception of our testing of goodwill in the abcs and profarma reporting units we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 with the exception of our testing of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in the mwi and profarma reporting units we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 with the exception of our testing of goodwill in the profarma reporting unit 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

when performing a quantitative impairment assessment we utilize an incomebased approach to value our reporting units with the exception of the profarma reporting unit the fair value of which is based upon its publiclytraded stock price plus an estimated control premium the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows andor market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of 

table of con t ents 

the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of its indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinitelived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 we recorded a goodwill impairment of 64 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with its fiscal 2021 annual impairment test see note 6 of the notes to consolidated financial statements no indefinitelived intangible asset impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 2020 and 2019 and no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 

finitelived intangible assets are amortized using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets we perform a recoverability assessment of our longlived assets when impairment indicators are present 

after us food and drug administration fda inspections of pharmedium healthcare holdings incs pharmedium compounding facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at its largest compounding facility located in memphis tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures 

as a result of the suspension of production activities at pharmediums compounding facility located in memphis tennessee and the regulatory matters we performed a recoverability assessment of pharmediums longlived assets and recorded a 5700 million impairment loss in the quarter ended march 31 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group exceeded its fair value prior to the impairment the carrying value of the asset group was 792 million the fair value of the asset group was 222 million as of march 31 2019 

as a result of the continued suspension of the production activities at pharmediums compounding facility located in memphis tennessee certain regulatory matters ongoing operational challenges and lowerthanexpected operating results we updated our recoverability assessment of pharmedium’s longlived assets as of december 31 2019 the recoverability assessment was based upon comparing pharmediums forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its asset group using forecasted undiscounted cash flows that were based on the weighted average of multiple strategic alternatives we concluded that the carrying value of the pharmedium longlived asset group was not recoverable as of december 31 2019 and recorded an impairment loss of 1380 million in the three months ended december 31 2019 we allocated 1232 million of the impairment to finitelived intangibles 116 million of the impairment to property and equipment and 32 million to rou assets 

in january 2020 we decided to permanently exit the pharmedium compounding business and as a result we ceased all commercial and administrative operations related to this business in fiscal 2020 the decision to permanently exit the pharmedium business was due to a number of factors including but not limited to ongoing operational regulatory and commercial challenges such as pharmediums decision in january 2020 to suspend production at the compounding facility in new jersey pending facility upgrades related to the air handling and filtration systems in connection with the decision to exit the pharmedium business we recorded an impairment of pharmediums assets of 2237 million in the three months ended march 31 2020 which included impairments of the remaining finitelived intangible assets and the majority of the remaining tangible assets 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit 

table of con t ents 

from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based upon the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 222 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2021

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 66 and 70 of our inventories as of september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively has been determined using the lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 13162 million and 15192 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30 2021 and 2020 respectively we recorded lifo credits of 2030 million and 225 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2021 and 2019 respectively we recorded a lifo expense of 74 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 the annual lifo provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences changes in inventory quantities and product mix many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas government investigations stockholder demands and other disputes including antitrust commercial product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency and whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can made in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements

commitments and obligations 

as discussed in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 with regard to litigation relating to our proposed global opioid settlement as well as other opioidrelated litigation we recorded a 66 billion liability 55 billion net of an income tax benefit on july 21 2021 it was announced that we and the two other national pharmaceutical distributors have negotiated a comprehensive proposed settlement agreement that if all conditions are satisfied would result in the resolution of a substantial majority of opioid lawsuits filed by state and local governmental entities the proposed settlement agreement includes a cash component pursuant to which we would pay up to approximately 

table of con t ents 

64 billion over 18 years including a 2884 million payment into escrow that was made in september 2021 the 2884 million that was paid into escrow did not reduce our shortterm liability as it was recorded as restricted cash in prepaid expense and other on our consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2021 the escrow payment related to the proposed settlement agreement will be disbursed following the effective date of the settlement or returned to us if the settlement does not become effective the payment of the aforementioned litigation liability has not and is not expected to have an impact on our ability to pay dividends 

the following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments as of september 30 2021 



the 2017 tax act required a onetime transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits we expect to pay 1756 million net of overpayments and tax credits related to this transition tax as of september 30 2021 which is payable in installments over a sixyear period that commenced in january 2021 the transition tax commitment is included in other commitments in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 5228 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2021 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table our liability for uncertain tax positions as of september 30 2021 primarily includes an uncertain tax benefit related to the 67 billion legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications as disclosed in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we had 09 billion of variablerate debt outstanding as of september 30 2021 we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want andor on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30 2021 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 25471 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2021 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we have exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling the turkish lira the egyptian pound the brazilian real and the canadian dollar with the june 2021 acquisition of alliance healthcare our foreign currency and exchange rate risk increased therefore we now use foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes revenue from our foreign operations during the fiscal year ended september 30 2021 was approximately five percent of our consolidated revenue and included four months of revenue from alliance healthcare we expect revenue from foreign operations to increase in the future as alliance healthcares revenue will comprise a larger portion of our total revenue 

deterioration of general economic conditions among other factors could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by iqvia an independent thirdparty provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 34 from 2019 through 2024 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 63 million by 2024 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 11 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies

legislative developments in 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers subsequent legislation and rules promulgated by government agencies have made additional changes to federal drug payment policies these policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 and the risk factor titled legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates on page 12 for further details

human capital 

we aspire to create healthier futures and accelerate business results by inspiring the best and brightest global talent across all dimensions of diversity to perform at their full potential as of september 30 2020 we had approximately 22000 employees of which approximately 21000 were fulltime employees more than 56 of our workforce is comprised of women 49 is comprised of individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds and 30 of our board of directors are women additionally our executive management committee is made up of 43 women 

approximately 2 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations however we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to extensive oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda the us department of justice doj and various other federal and state authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and false claims act the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the false claims act prohibits knowingly submitting or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government and authorizes treble damages and substantial civil penalties in the case of violations the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the supply chain security legislation known as the drug quality and security act “dqsa” became law in 2013 the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dqsa also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers we expect that the fda and eventually comparable state agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and thirdparty logistics providers there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the dqsa requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance these and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations 

the regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services in addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate certain of our distribution centers which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

any future reductions in medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

table of contents 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors beginning on page 8 for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and privacy practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information as defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access protected health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the hipaa regulations 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information among other things the hitech act expanded certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards in january 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rule

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

industry and economic risks 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes 

in fiscal 2020 we continued to experience unfavorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings we expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2021 which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products generally use wholesale acquisition cost wac as the reference price we sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using wac as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price if manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to wac or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our results of operations could be adversely affected additionally there are a number of government policy initiatives being considered which if enacted could directly or indirectly regulate or impact wac prices if such initiatives are passed or finalized and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers andor customers our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation additionally certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows whether due to regulatory mandates the implementation of legislative proposals policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the competition section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies and health insurers which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business if we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services 

our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the covid19 pandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has led to a general worsening of economic conditions which has put financial pressure on many of our customers and may threaten certain customers’ ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to repay their obligations to us as they become due the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations as of september 30 2020 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 47 and 7 of accounts receivable net 

  

table of contents 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions pending litigation and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings 

if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing impair our liquidity or adversely impact our business 

additionally rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities to maintain our ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability negative trends in the general economy including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

business and operational risks 

our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss or renewal at less favorable terms of a significant customer or group purchasing organization 

wba accounted for approximately 33 of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 express scripts accounted for approximately 12 of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 our top ten customers including governmental agencies and gpos represented approximately 64 of revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows additionally from time to time significant contracts may be renewed or modified prior to their expiration date in furtherance of our strategic objectives if those contracts are renewed or modified at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

the anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized 

in may 2016 we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with wba  specifically our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which 

table of contents 

walgreens boots alliance development gmbh wbad provides a variety of services including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf this reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with wba would result in various benefits including among other things continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the potential inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility potential changes in supplier relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to wba including changes necessitated by changing market conditions or other unforeseen developments that may arise during the term of the distribution agreement to the extent that any such changes are not offset by other financial benefits that we are able to obtain through collaboration in other aspects of our strategic relationship with wba and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with wba in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship 

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements dated march 18 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholder agreement any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve any of our objectives the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason deemed within our control we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all 

our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by the global coronavirus covid19 pandemic natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability moreover if the economic benefits we are able to obtain through the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba decline due to changes in market conditions or other changes impacting the fees and rebates that generic manufacturers make available through the arrangement our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

as part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

table of contents 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives the impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50 countries we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and the political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition changes or uncertainty in us or foreign policy including any changes or uncertainty with respect to us or international trade policies or tariffs also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to operational and logistical risks that might not be covered by insurance 

we have distribution centers and facilities located in the united states and throughout the world our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and the provision of related services including with respect to cold chain storage and shipping we anticipate that the volume of cold chain storage and shipping may increase due to the covid19 pandemic as we assist with the strategic national stockpile as well as possible distribution of covid19 vaccines although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage coverage on acceptable terms might be unavailable or coverage might not cover our losses or may require large deductibles uninsured losses or operational losses that result in large deductible payments in order to receive insurance coverage might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations 

litigation and regulatory risks 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution 

at the federal level the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system by november 2023 the dqsa and in particular title ii of the dqsa the drug supply chain security act dscsa also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and 

table of contents 

thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers 

there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the dqsa requirements including the dscsa requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance our international operations may also be subject to local regulations containing recordkeeping and other obligations related to our distribution operations in those locations pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs and could have an adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 

as discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states in addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution prescribing and dispensing of these drugs 

complying with the dqsa requirements including the dscsa requirements and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution requirements including followon actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined or regulating pricing contracting and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services additionally on occasion price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries federal and state investigations and private litigation any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement such as pricing controls or indexing models at the federal or state level could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the affordable care act aca became law in march 2010 and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting medicare and medicaid reimbursement pricing and contracting for prescription drugs including changes to the medicaid rebate statute given the scope of the changes made by the aca and continuing implementation controversies we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca may have on the aca or other healthcare legislation and regulation 

subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies including the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which increased the medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians hospitals community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under part b of the medicare program the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms published a final rule in november 2017 that reduces medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug discount program from average sales price asp plus 6 to asp minus 225 with certain exceptions effective january 2018 in july 2020 the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia reversed the district court’s decision which would allow the payment reductions to take effect while the appeals process is still underway cms solicited comments in the proposed calendar year 2020 medicare outpatient prospective payment system rule on appropriate payment for such 340bacquired drugs and finalized a rule in november 2019 that would impose the same asp minus 225 rate that was the subject of the litigation described above separately november 2018 cms published a final rule that reduces from 6 to 3 the “addon” payment for new separatelypayable part b drugs and

biologicals that are paid based on wac when asp data during first quarter or sales is unavailable there can be no assurance that recent or future rules established by cms will not have an adverse impact on our business 

further even where the government does not affirmatively change drug price regulation standards other parties in the drug manufacturing and distribution system may change their interpretation or approach to implementing or complying with those standards in a manner that may adversely affect our business for example the 340b drug discount program requires manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient drugs to “covered entity” safety net providers and previous health resources and services administration “hrsa” guidance has allowed covered entities to dispense 340b discounted drugs through arrangements with multiple “contract pharmacies” recently several manufacturers have announced initiatives that may inhibit or limit covered entities’ ability to use any or multiple contract pharmacies and may direct us not to honor 340b discounted pricing requests on orders to be shipped to contract pharmacies or may not honor chargebacks where such discounts are extended to contract pharmacies hrsa has initially indicated that it lacks regulatory authority to enforce its prior guidance allowing multiple contract pharmacies but recently advised that it is considering whether it may have other enforcement remedies in the event that manufacturers do not extend 340b discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements our customers include covered entities and organizations with significant participation as contract pharmacies and the unavailability of 340b discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements may adversely affect such customers and therefore could adversely affect our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities notably the trump administration and members of congress proposed numerous amendments to part b drug distribution and payment models during 2018 the trump administration has also sought to implement demonstration projects that may affect drug payments some of these proposals could have significant effects on our business including an executive order issued on september 13 2020 to test a most favored nations model for part b and part d drugs that tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to medicare drug pricing regulations such as asp calculations could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

finally federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as medicare and medicaid which may adversely affect our business for example several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs on july 31 2019 the department of health and human services announced a “safe importation action plan” that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets on july 24 2020 the trump administration issued an “executive order on increasing drug importation to lower prices for american patients” calling for the federal government to exercise its authority under the federal food drug and cosmetic act to permit drug imports from canada reimportation of certain insulin products and casebycase waivers to certain importers provided such importation poses no risk to public safety and results in lower costs there can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs or to government drug price regulation programs such as the medicaid rebate asp or 340b program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca many states have enacted similar statutes which are not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those

relating to certain incentives offered in connection with sales of pharmaceutical products and related services are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business 

certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the supply chain including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the distribution of opioid medications in addition a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the supply chain by state and local governmental entities and other plaintiffs for claims related to the company’s distribution of opioid medications the lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future and lawsuits could be brought against the company by other plaintiffs under other theories related to opioid abuse we are deeply committed to diversion control efforts have sophisticated systems in place to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious including through the use of data analytics and engage in significant due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways including through increased costs and harm to our re putation 

we are currently engaged in advanced discussions which are ongoing with the objective of reaching potential terms which would include monetary payments and certain changes to our antidiversion programs for a global resolution of the multidistrict opioid litigation involving c ertain state and local governmental entities and other related state court litigation described in note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements while a global settlement with respect to certain governmental entities within the multidistrict litigation mdl and other related state court litigation remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward we believe a global settlement is probable and its liability related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of september 30 2020 we have recorded a charge of 66 billion in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 related to the global settlement and other related opioid litigation until such time as a plaintiff participates in a global settlement or otherwise resolves its lawsuit we will continue to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the multidistrict opioid litigation those remanded from the multidistrict opioid litigation to federal district courts as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all such cases since these matters are still developing we are unable to predict the outcome but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts andor injunctive relief including changes to our antidiversion programs that may affect how we operate our business further any final settlement amongst parties may differ materially from our advanced discussions related to global resolution of the multidistrict opioid litigation the inability to reach a global settlement of the multidistrict opioid litigation and adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders 

legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict for example new york has instituted an opioid excise tax which went into effect on july 1 2019 and replaces a prior assessment under new yorks opioid stewardship act and taxes entities that make the initial sale or distribution of opioid medications into the state in addition rhode island and delaware have enacted opioid taxes minnesota has enacted increased licensure fees and other states are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states if additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings 

we conduct our operations through a variety of businesses including the distribution of pharmaceuticals the dispensing of healthcare products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings these disputes or proceedings have involved or may involve 

table of contents 

healthcare fraud and abuse the false claims act antitrust class action commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing public disclosures and various other claims including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to ordinary business operations the defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition violations of various federal and state laws including with respect to the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs any settlement judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

statutory andor regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of brand andor generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

  in fiscal 2018 we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement with the office of inspector general of the us department of health and human services the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term failure to comply with obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties 

tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives such as changes to the federal corporate tax rate the repeal of lastin firstout lifo treatment or the promulgation of state opioid taxes and fees may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments would be made further we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal the 2017 tax act or enact alternative legislation by the incoming presidential administration or the next congress 

violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or

more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the united states and beyond that regulate the collection use security processing and transfer of personal data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals many foreign data privacy regulations including gdpr in the european union brazils new general data protection law lgpd and the personal information protection and electronic documents act in canada and certain state laws and regulations including californias ccpa impose requirements beyond those enacted under united states federal law including in some instances private rights of action we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties that or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position 

other risks 

we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics and the continued spread of covid19 is adversely affecting our business 

we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics including risks related to any responses thereto by the federal or state governments as well as customers and suppliers the covid19 pandemic is adversely affecting and is expected to continue to adversely affect our operations supply chains and distribution network and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in supply and demand for certain of our products and services further it is possible that the manufacturers that produce the products that we distribute may experience delays or shutdowns due to covid19 such as from disruptions in their supply chains or in a suspension of production at their own facilities accordingly we expect the continued spread of covid19 to adversely affect the supply of products andor potentially disrupt our ability to deliver products to customers any extended disruption in our ability to service our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

we also face risks related to our employees health and the impact it may have on operations certain of our employees have contracted covid19 which resulted in our decision to temporarily close and subsequently reopen a small number of our distribution centers in accordance with our internal protocols we have implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and have protocols in place to address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations but a widespread or sustained outbreak of covid19 at one or more locations could disrupt our ability to service our customers 

since april 2020 covid19 has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows for instance demand for certain animal health products in our mwi business declined during the covid19 pandemic and this reduced demand may continue as customers reduce or postpone purchases viewed as discretionary we also face risks related to a downturn in our customers respective businesses including the operations of our retail pharmacy and health systems customers an economic slowdown or recession related to covid19 may affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their business on acceptable terms which could result in reduced spending on our products and services 

certain enterprisewide initiatives intended to improve our operational efficiency and financial performance such as technology initiatives related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems may take longer than originally expected to complete as we focus on covid19related issues additionally a large portion of our employees are working remotely an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business 

the impacts of the continued spread of covid19 could also cause other unpredictable events each of which could adversely affect our business revenue results of operations cash flows or financial condition for example the continued spread of covid19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets a sustained or prolonged outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact of such events and the impact of covid19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in item 1a to our form 10k any of which could have a material adverse effect on us

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers we continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems including but not limited to the expanded implementation of our primary erp system to integrate certain of our key business areas thirdparty service providers are also responsible for managing a portion of our information systems to the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail or to the extent there are data center interruptions our business and results of operations may be adversely affected our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a thirdparty service provider does not perform satisfactorily or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloudbased infrastructure and other services new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks a failure interruption or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our thirdparty service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data damage our reputation cause loss of customers or revenue increase our costs result in litigation andor regulatory action andor cause other losses any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures controls and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

additionally as discussed above in the risk factor “we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics and the continued spread of covid19 is adversely affecting our business” a large portion of our employees are working remotely an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans introduce operational risk including but not limited to cybersecurity risks and impair our ability to manage our business

revenue 



we currently expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the midsingle digits in fiscal 2021 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars price inflation and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other thirdparty reimbursement rates to our customers changes in federal government rules and regulations and the impact of the covid19 pandemic see risk factor  we face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics and the continued spread of covid19 is adversely affecting our business 

revenue increased by 57 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 56 or 97 billion from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the organic growth of some of its largest customers continued strong increased specialty pharmaceutical product sales which generally have higher selling prices and overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth and to a lesser extent inflationary increases in brand drugs 

more specifically the increase in the pharmaceutical distribution services segment revenue was largely attributable to the following in billions 



revenue in other increased 96 from the prior fiscal year due to growth at all three operating segments abcs mwi and world courier 

a number of our contracts with customers including group purchasing organizations are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 no significant contracts expired over the next twelve months there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire additionally from time to time significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended renewed or replaced prior to their expiration dates if those contracts are extended renewed or replaced at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows

gross profit 



gross profit increased 10 or 536 million from the prior fiscal year gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services and other and lower pharmedium remediation costs and was offset in part by lower gains from antitrust litigation settlements lifo expense in comparison to a lifo credit in the prior fiscal year and an estimated assessment related to the new york state osa compared to a reversal of a previouslyestimated assessment related to the osa see below 

pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 38 or 1411 million from the prior fiscal year due to the strong increase in specialty product sales as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 210 in the current fiscal year decreased 3 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales to our larger customers which typically have lower gross profit margins 

gross profit in other increased 65 or 854 million from the prior fiscal year due to growth at world courier mwi and abcs as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 1860 in the current fiscal year decreased from 1913 in the prior fiscal year 

we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of 91 million and 1459 million during the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold see note 15 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our cost of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences changes in inventory quantities and product mix many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision the lifo expense in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower generic deflation offset in part by a higher generic inventory mix in comparison to the prior fiscal year 

we incurred remediation costs in connection with the suspended production activities at pharmedium we also incurred shutdown costs in connection with permanently exiting the pharmedium compounding business 

new york state nys enacted the osa which went into effect on july 1 2018 the osa established an annual 100 million opioid stewardship fund the fund and required manufacturers distributors and importers licensed in nys to ratably source the fund the ratable share of the assessment for each licensee was to be based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within nys in september 2018 we accrued 220 million as an estimate of our liability under the osa for the period from january 1 2017 through september 30 2018 in december 2018 the osa was ruled unconstitutional by the us district court for the southern district of new york and as a result we reversed the 220 million accrual in the quarter ended december 31 2018 in september 2020 the united states court of appeals for the second circuit reversed the district court’s decision and as a result we accrued 148 million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september 30 2020 as we revised our estimated liability for the 2017 and 2018 calendar years

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased 39 or 1037 million from the prior fiscal year the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in operating costs to support our revenue growth and costs incurred in connection with permanently exiting the pharmedium compounding business such as contract termination fees offset in part by operational synergies realized from the integration of hd smith within pharmaceutical distribution services as a percentage of revenue distribution selling and administrative expenses were 146 in the current fiscal year and represents a 2basis point decrease compared to the prior fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends the allowance for returns as of september 30 2020 and 2019 was 13446 million and 11475 million respectively 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing payment and default history and macroeconomic conditions changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs 

table of contents 

ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 2019 and 2018 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 2019 and 2018 was 119 million 252 million and 167 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2020 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 139 million the allowance for doubtful accounts was 727 million and 764 million as of september 30 2020 and 2019 respectively 

schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure beginning with our operating segments we aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics which include the similarity of longterm gross margins the nature of the components products services and production processes the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers and the components regulatory environment our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services profarma abcs world courier and mwi 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively such qualitative factors can include among other industry and market conditions overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events if we conclude based on our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative analysis we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 with the exception of our testing of goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles in the mwi and the profarma reporting units we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 with the exception of our testing in the profarma reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

when performing a quantitative impairment assessment we utilize an incomebased approach to value our reporting units with the exception of the profarma reporting unit the fair value of which is based upon its publiclytraded stock price plus an estimated control premium the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we generally 

table of contents 

believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows andor market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinitelived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 2019 and 2018 we recorded a goodwill impairment of 597 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 and 2019 no indefinitelived intangible impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2020 2019 and 2018 

we perform a recoverability assessment of our longlived assets when impairment indicators are present 

after us food and drug administration fda inspections of pharmediums compounding facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at its largest compounding facility located in memphis tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures 

as a result of the suspension of production activities at pharmediums compounding facility located in memphis tennessee and the regulatory matters we performed a recoverability assessment of pharmediums longlived assets and recorded a 5700 million impairment loss in the quarter ended march 31 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group exceeded its fair value prior to the impairment the carrying value of the asset group was 792 million the fair value of the asset group was 222 million as of march 31 2019 the pharmedium asset group was included in the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of pharmediums asset group included i a 15 discount rate which contemplated a higher risk at pharmedium ii the period in which pharmedium will resume production at or near capacity and iii the estimated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs we believed that our fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions however the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment were inherently uncertain and included assumptions that differed from actual results in future periods see below this represents a level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement we allocated 5221 million of the impairment to finitelived intangibles 4208 million of customer relationships 799 million of a trade name and 214 million of software technology and 479 million of the impairment to property and equipment 

we updated our recoverability assessment of pharmediums longlived assets as of september 30 2019 and we concluded that pharmedium’s longlived assets were recoverable as of september 30 2019 

as a result of the continued suspension of the production activities at pharmediums compounding facility located in memphis tennessee certain regulatory matters ongoing operational challenges and lowerthanexpected operating results we updated our recoverability assessment of pharmedium’s longlived assets as of december 31 2019 the recoverability assessment was based upon comparing pharmediums forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its asset group using forecasted undiscounted cash flows that were based on the weighted average of multiple strategic alternatives we concluded that the carrying value of the pharmedium longlived asset group was not recoverable as of december 31 2019 the forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of december 31 2019 were lower than the forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of september 30 2019 due to a change in weighting of multiple strategic alternatives and lower operating results in the three months ended december 31 2019 compared to expectations we then performed an impairment test by comparing the pharmedium asset groups fair value of 145 million to its carrying value which resulted in a 1380 million impairment loss in the three months ended december 31 2019 significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of pharmediums asset group included i a 17 discount rate which contemplated a higher risk at pharmedium ii the period in which pharmedium will resume production at or near capacity and iii the estimated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs we believed 

table of contents 

that our fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions however the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment were inherently uncertain and included assumptions that differed from actual results in future periods see below this represented a level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement we allocated 1232 million of the impairment to finitelived intangibles 116 million of the impairment to property and equipment and 32 million to rou assets 

in january 2020 we decided to permanently exit the pharmedium compounding business and as a result we ceased all commercial and administrative operations related to this business in fiscal 2020 the decision to permanently exit the pharmedium business was due to a number of factors including but not limited to ongoing operational regulatory and commercial challenges such as pharmediums decision in january 2020 to suspend production at the compounding facility in new jersey pending facility upgrades related to the air handling and filtration systems in connection with the decision to exit the pharmedium business we recorded an impairment of pharmediums assets of 2237 million in the three months ended march 31 2020 which included impairments of the remaining finitelived intangible assets and the majority of the remaining tangible assets 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based upon the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 529 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2020

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 45977 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2020 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in 

table of contents 

interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling the canadian dollar and the brazilian real revenue from our foreign operations is approximately two percent of our consolidated revenue we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by iqvia an independent thirdparty provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 42 from 2018 through 2023 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 61 million by 2023 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 11 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies

legislative developments in 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details

government regulation 

we are subject to extensive oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the supply chain security legislation known as the drug quality and security act “dqsa” became law in 2013 the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dqsa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers we expect that the fda and eventually comparable state agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and thirdparty logistics providers in addition the dqsa created 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for providers of compounded sterile preparations csps allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new dqsa requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance these and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations 

the regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services in addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate our distribution centers or section 503b outsourcing facilities which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information as defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access protected health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the hipaa regulations 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act enacted as part of the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information among other things the hitech act expanded certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rule

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material the reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes 

in fiscal 2019 we continued to experience unfavorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings we expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2020 which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products generally use wholesale acquisition cost wac as the reference price we sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using wac as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price if manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to wac or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our results of operations could be adversely affected additionally there are a number of policy initiatives being considered which if enacted could directly or indirectly regulate or impact wac list prices if such initiatives are passed and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers andor customers our results of operations could be adversely impacted 

the pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation additionally certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows whether due to regulatory mandates the implementation of legislative proposals policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the competition section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies and health insurers which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business if we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding 

at the federal level the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system by november 2023 the dqsa also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers in addition the dqsa established 503b outsourcing facilities as a category for providers of csps allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as 503b 

table of contents 

outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities 

there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the dqsa requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance moreover we expect that the fda will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the dqsa including those relating to current good manufacturing practices cgmps and other matters related to 503b outsourcing facilities which may require changes to our business some of which may be significant additional details on risks related to our 503b outsourcing facilities and implementation of cgmps are described below 

as discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states in addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution prescribing and dispensing of these drugs 

complying with the dqsa requirements and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution and compounding requirements including followon actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined or regulating pricing contracting and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services additionally on occasion price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries federal and state investigations and private litigation any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement such as pricing controls or indexing models at the federal or state level could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the affordable care act aca became law in march 2010 and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting medicare and medicaid reimbursement pricing and contracting for prescription drugs including changes to the medicaid rebate statute given the scope of the changes made by the aca and continuing implementation controversies we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca may have on the aca or other healthcare legislation and regulation 

subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies including the bipartisan budget act of 2018 which increased the medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians hospitals community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under part b of the medicare program the centers of medicare  medicaid services cms published a final rule on november 13 2017 that reduces medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug discount program from average sales price asp plus 6 to asp minus 225 with certain exceptions effective january 1 2018 on december 27 2018 the united states district court for the district of columbia concluded that this policy exceeded cms statutory authority with regard to 2018 payments while the appeals process is still underway cms solicited comments in the proposed calendar year 2020 medicare outpatient prospective payment system rule on appropriate payment for such 340bacquired drugs potentially including a reduced rate of asp plus 3 

table of contents 

for calendar years 2018 through 2020 separately on november 21 2018 cms published a final rule that reduces from 6 to 3 the “addon” payment for new separatelypayable part b drugs and biologicals that are paid based on wac when asp data during first quarter or sales is unavailable 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities notably the trump administration and members of congress proposed numerous amendments to part b drug distribution and payment models during 2018 and have continued to do so throughout 2019 some of these proposals could have significant effects on our business including a potential proposal to create an “international pricing index” payment model that would modify distribution methods for part b drugs and tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to medicare drug pricing regulations such as asp calculations could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have a material adverse effect on our business 

finally federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as medicare and medicaid which may adversely affect our business for example several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multipayer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs on july 31 2019 the department of health and human services announced a “safe importation action plan” that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets there can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs or to government drug price regulation programs such as the medicaid rebate asp or 340b program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business 

certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the supply chain including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the distribution of opioid medications in addition a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the supply chain the lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future we are deeply committed to diversion control efforts have sophisticated systems in place to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious including through the use of data analytics and engage in significant due diligence 

table of contents 

and ongoing monitoring of customers while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways including through increased costs and harm to our reputation 

we are currently engaged in discussions with the objective of reaching potential terms for a global resolution of the multidistrict opioid litigation and other related state court litigation described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements given the large number of parties involved the complexity and difficulty of the underlying issues and the resulting uncertainty of achieving a potential global resolution we continue to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the multidistrict opioid litigation as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all such cases since these matters are still developing we are unable to predict the outcome but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts andor injunctive relief that may affect how we operate our business or we may enter into settlements of claims that may also include monetary payments andor injunctive relief the adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders 

legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict for example new york has instituted an opioid excise tax which went into effect on july 1 2019 and taxes entities that make the initial sale or distribution of opioid medications into the state in addition rhode island and delaware have enacted opioid taxes minnesota has enacted increased licensure fees and other states are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states if additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings 

we conduct our operations through a variety of businesses including the distribution of pharmaceuticals the dispensing of healthcare products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings involving healthcare fraud and abuse the false claims act antitrust class action commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing and various other claims including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to ordinary business operations the defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition violations of various federal and state laws including with respect to the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs any settlement judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations 

statutory andor regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of brand andor generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

in fiscal 2018 we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term failure to comply with obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties

the anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized 

in may 2016 we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with wba  specifically our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which walgreens boots alliance development gmbh wbad provides a variety of services including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf this reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with wba would result in various benefits including among other things continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the potential inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility potential changes in supplier relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship unforeseen changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to wba and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with wba in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship 

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements dated march 18 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholder agreement any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability if the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected 

if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives such as the repeal of lastin firstout lifo treatment or the promulgation of state opioid taxes and fees may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments would be made 

the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities to purchase compound store andor distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations

we have received and may in the future receive requests for information letters and subpoenas from the dea fda various us attorneys offices of the doj andor state attorneys general and state regulatory authorities and agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances and our order monitoring program which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances or other matters we generally respond to subpoenas requests letters and other authority andor agency correspondence in a thorough and timely manner these responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us such as costs related to addressing the observations listed on fda form 483 reports such subpoenas requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil criminal or regulatory legal proceedings against us as well as to settlements and the suspension or revocation of registrations required by our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations 

in december 2017 following fda inspections of our 503b outsourcing facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities at our largest 503b outsourcing facility located in memphis tennessee in may 2019 pharmedium reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree the “consent decree” with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the doj the consent decree permits commercial operations to continue at pharmedium’s dayton new jersey and sugar land texas compounding facilities and administrative operations to continue at its lake forest illinois headquarters subject to 

table of contents 

compliance with the requirements set forth therein as required by the consent decree we have completed audit inspections by an independent cgmp expert at the dayton and sugar land facilities to determine that the facilities are being operated in conformity with cgmp additional audit inspections by the independent cgmp expert of the sugar land and dayton facilities are also required at least annually for a period of four years 

the consent decree also establishes requirements that must be satisfied prior to the resumption of commercial operations at the memphis tennessee facility through fiscal 2019 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the memphis suspension our results of operations will continue to be adversely impacted until the memphis facility resumes commercial distribution and we cannot predict if or when the fda will permit pharmedium to resume commercial distribution at the memphis facility 

separately we have agreed in several state regulatory matters to consent orders or temporary licensing suspensions regarding certain of our 503b outsourcing facilities certain other states have requested information concerning the status of operations at some or all of our 503b outsourcing facilities these state regulatory matters preclude us from commercially distributing into certain states which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

additionally the fda may from time to time issue form 483 reports and warning letters in connection with their oversight of 503b outsourcing facilities prior to our acquisition of the business pharmedium received a warning letter from the fda in 2014 and a series of form 483 reports were issued in 2015 and 2016 following up on the 2014 letter we cannot be assured that the fda and doj will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of pharmedium’s corrective actions in response to this warning letter or the form 483 reports a failure to comply with the consent decree or to address observations identified by the fda in form 483 reports or any warning letters issued by the fda or observations identified by any other federal and state regulatory authority including a failure to resolve the observations identified by the 2014 warning letter and subsequent form 483 reports could lead to the suspension of facilities currently in operation an enforcement action monetary penalties andor license revocation each of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations 

the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously and failures or errors in production labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm 

the production labeling and packaging of csps is inherently risky our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps including quality issues manufacturing or labeling flaws improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products any of which could result from human or other error any of these situations could lead to a recall of or safety alert relating to one or more of our products in addition in the ordinary course of business we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products any recall or retrieval whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory authorities could result in significant costs and negative publicity negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare selfregulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings any such action litigation recall or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us changes in the commercial insurance market may impair or prohibit our ability to obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure 

table of contents 

of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

as previously disclosed we have commenced a comprehensive strategic and financial review of pharmedium which remains ongoing the review includes consideration of the ongoing regulatory operational and financial challenges that face pharmedium as a result of the consent decree state regulatory actions and related matters while we are unable to predict the outcome of the review if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation results of operations or financial condition 

our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures 

we regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives when we decide to sell assets or a business we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives the impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated 

violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50 countries we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and the political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition changes or uncertainty in us or foreign policy including any changes or uncertainty with respect to us or international trade policies or tariffs also can disrupt our global operations as well as our customers and suppliers in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings 

if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing impair our liquidity or adversely impact our business 

additionally rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities to maintain our ratings we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings actual or 

table of contents 

anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook could limit our access to public debt markets limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2019 compared to the year ended september 30 2018 

revenue 



we currently expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the mid to highsingle digits in fiscal 2020 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies including biosimilars the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs price inflation and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other thirdparty reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

revenue increased by 69 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 69 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers continued strong specialty product sales and overall market growth in addition revenue increased in the current fiscal year due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of hd smith 

revenue in other increased 85 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to abcss growth in its canadian operations growth at mwi growth at world courier and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil 

a number of our contracts with customers including group purchasing organizations are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019  no significant contracts expired over the next twelve months there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire additionally from time to time significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended renewed or replaced prior to their expiration dates if those contracts are extended renewed or replaced at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows

in other an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements the lifo credit in the current year in comparison to a lifo expense in the prior year and the reversal of a previouslyestimated assessment related to the new york state opioid stewardship act 

our cost of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences changes in inventory quantities and product mix many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision the lifo credit in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower brand inflation offset in part by lower generic deflation in comparison to the prior fiscal year 

after fda inspections of our compounding facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at our largest compounding facility located in memphis pending execution of certain remedial measures see notes 1 and 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we continue to incur remediation costs in connection with our compounding operations additionally in april 2019 we ceased production at our compounding facility in cleveland mississippi 

new york state nys enacted the opioid stewardship act osa which went into effect on july 1 2018 the osa established an annual 100 million opioid stewardship fund the fund and required manufacturers distributors and importers licensed in nys to ratably source the fund the ratable share of the assessment for each licensee was to be based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within nys in september 2018 we accrued 220 million as an estimate of our liability under the osa for the period from january 1 2017 through september 30 2018 in december 2018 the osa was ruled unconstitutional by the us district court for the southern district of new york and as a result we reversed the 220 million accrual in the quarter ended december 31 2018 nys filed an appeal of the court decision on january 17 2019 however we do not believe a loss contingency is probable 

pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased 62  or 2160 million  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue largely due to strong specialty product sales the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of hd smith and was negatively impacted by our pharmaceutical compounding operations as production at our memphis facility has been suspended since december 2017 as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 213 in the current fiscal year remained relatively flat compared to the prior fiscal year

our effective tax rates were 372 and 603 in the fiscal years ended september 30 2018 and 2017 respectively our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of the 2017 tax act our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 of 4385 million reflects 6126 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 both resulting from the 2017 tax act additionally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 was negatively impacted by nondeductible legal settlement charges our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by our international businesses in switzerland and ireland which have lower income tax rates and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting 

net income attributable to amerisourcebergen corporation was significantly higher in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 primarily due to the 2017 tax act and legal settlement charges that were incurred in the prior fiscal year

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends the allowance for returns as of september 30 2019 and 2018 was 11475 million and 9888 million respectively 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018  and 2017  and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018  and 2017 was 252 million  167 million  and 89 million  respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2019 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 125 million  the allowance for doubtful accounts was 764 million and 611 million as of september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively 

schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure beginning with our operating segments we aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics which include the similarity of longterm gross margins the nature of the components products services and production processes the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers and the components regulatory environment our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services profarma abcs world courier and mwi 

table of contents 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively such qualitative factors can include among other industry and market conditions overall financial performance and relevant entityspecific events if we conclude based on our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value we perform a quantitative analysis we elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 with the exception of our testing in the profarma reporting unit in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets 

the quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

when performing a quantitative impairment assessment we utilize an incomebased approach to value our reporting units with the exception of the profarma reporting unit the fair value of which is based upon its publiclytraded stock price plus an estimated control premium the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows andor market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the quantitative impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinitelived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30 2019  2018  and 2017  we recorded a goodwill impairment of 597 million in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial statements no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2017 no indefinitelived intangible impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 2018 and 2017 

we perform a recoverability assessment of our longlived assets when impairment indicators are present 

pharmediums longlived assets were tested for recoverability in fiscal 2019 and 2018 due to the existence of impairment indicators after us food and drug administration fda inspections of pharmedium compounding facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at our largest compounding facility located in memphis tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures on may 17 2019 pharmedium reached an agreement on the terms of a consent decree the consent decree with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the department of justice doj that was entered by the united states district court for the northern district of illinois on may 22 2019 the consent decree permits commercial operations to continue at pharmedium’s dayton new jersey and sugar land texas compounding facilities and administrative operations to continue at its lake forest illinois headquarters subject to compliance with requirements set forth therein as required by the consent decree initial audit inspections were conducted by an independent cgmp expert of the dayton and sugar land facilities the cgmp expert has notified the fda that all of the shortterm corrective actions taken are acceptable pharmedium has submitted to the fda several additional longerterm corrective actions and the independent cgmp expert will assess the effectiveness of the implementation of these items in future audits additional audit inspections by the independent cgmp expert of the sugar land and dayton facilities are also required at least annually for a period of four years 

table of contents 

the consent decree also establishes requirements that must be satisfied prior to the resumption of commercial operations at the memphis tennessee facility the requirements include a work plan approved by the fda and an audit inspection and certification by an independent cgmp expert that the facilities methods and controls at the memphis facility and pharmedium’s lake forest illinois headquarters comply with the consent decree if pharmedium receives written notification from the fda of compliance with the requirements to resume operations at the memphis facility additional audit inspections are required for five years during which time pharmedium must correct any deviations from the consent decree observed by the independent cgmp expert 

after five years pharmedium may petition the district court for full relief from the consent decree or for specific relief with regard to one or more facilities if at the time of such petition all obligations under the consent decree with respect to the specific facilities for which pharmedium is seeking relief have been satisfied and there has been continuous compliance with the consent decree for at least five years the federal government will not oppose the petition and pharmedium may request that the district court grant such relief 

as a result of the suspension of production activities at pharmediums compounding facility located in memphis tennessee and the aforementioned regulatory matters we performed a recoverability assessment of pharmediums longlived assets and recorded a 5700 million impairment loss in the quarter ended march 31 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group exceeded its fair value prior to the impairment the carrying value of the asset group was 792 million the fair value of the asset group was 222 million as of march 31 2019 the pharmedium asset group is included in the pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of pharmediums asset group included i a 15 discount rate which contemplated a higher risk at pharmedium ii the period in which pharmedium will resume production at or near capacity and iii the estimated ebitda earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs we believe that our fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions however the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions that could differ from actual results in future periods this represents a level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement we allocated 5221 million of the impairment to finitelived intangibles  4208 million of customer relationships 799 million of a trade name and 214 million of software technology and 479 million of the impairment to property and equipment 

we updated our recoverability assessment of pharmedium’s longlived assets as of september 30 2019 we concluded that pharmedium’s longlived assets were recoverable as of september 30 2019 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based upon the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 97 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2019

inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 75 of our inventories as of september 30 2019 and 2018 has been determined using the lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 15118 million and 15344 million higher than the amounts reported as of september 30 2019 and 2018  respectively we recorded lifo credits of 225 million and 1578 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2019 and 2017 respectively we recorded lifo expense of 673 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas government investigations and other disputes including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements although we are not able to predict the outcome or reasonably estimate a range of possible losses in these matters an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations consolidated financial position cash flows or liquidity

deterioration of general economic conditions among other factors could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

we use days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance the below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends 



our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period end working capital additionally any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30 2019 included 1674 million of interest payments and 1177 million of income tax payments net of refunds operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 included 1621 million of interest payments and 1040 million of income tax payments net of refunds operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 included 1253 million of interest payments and 1050 million of income tax payments net of refunds

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we had 09 billion of variablerate debt outstanding as of september 30 2019  we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want andor on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30 2019  

table of contents 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 33742 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2019  the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling the canadian dollar and the brazilian real revenue from our foreign operations is approximately two percent of our consolidated revenue we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by iqvia an independent thirdparty provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 55 from 2017 through 2022 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 59 million by 2022 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals  a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 12 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

table of contents 

legislative developments  in 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details 

other economic conditions and certain risk factors could adversely affect our business and prospects see item 1a risk factors on page 8

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act the aca became law in 2010 the aca is intended to expand health insurance including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the aca contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid among other things the aca changed the formula for medicaid federal upper payment limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price further implementing regulations require state medicaid programs to apply payment mechanisms for branded prescription drugs which are consistent with pharmacies actual acquisition costs for drugs these provisions could reduce prescription drug reimbursement levels under state medicaid programs 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system in addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant

additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate our distribution centers or section 503b outsourcing facilities which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

any future reductions in medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors beginning on page 8 for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and privacy practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information as defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access protected health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the hipaa regulations 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act enacted as part of the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information among other things the hitech act expanded certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rule 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other personal information including sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa the hitech act and the implementing regulations personally identifiable information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate as such regulations continue to evolve we need to comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of these countries including but not limited to those in the european union most notably certain aspects of our business are subject to the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 we have a gdpr compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with gdpr regulations there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes and fewer generic pharmaceutical launches 

in fiscal 2018 we continued to experience an unfavorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing environment which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings we expect this to continue in fiscal 2019 which could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 

our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products generally use wholesale acquisition cost wac as the reference price similarly we sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using wac as the reference price in may 2018 the trump administration announced a wideranging blueprint to address concerns over drug pricing which listed among other things potential mechanisms to encourage manufacturers to limit increases in or to reduce the wac of individual products although the blueprint did not create legal or regulatory mandates and no specific mandates have been passed or proposed thus far some manufacturers announced price freezes or delays in wac increases in the ensuing months if the government enacts proposals to directly or indirectly regulate wac list prices or if manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to wac and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services our results of operations could be adversely affected 

the pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation additionally certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows whether due to regulatory mandates the implementation of any of the policy proposals noted in the blueprint or voluntary manufacturer actions our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater a decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those in the past could also adversely impact our results of operations 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the competition section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers retail pharmacies and health insurers which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business if we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding 

at the federal level the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dqsa also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and thirdparty logistics providers including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed thirdparty logistics providers in addition the dqsa established 503b outsourcing facilities as a category for providers of csps 

table of contents 

allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities 

there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new dqsa requirements or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance moreover we expect that the fda will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the dqsa including those relating to current good manufacturing practices gmps and other matters related to 503b outsourcing facilities which may require changes to our business some of which may be significant complying with these and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution and compounding requirements could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

legal regulatory and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement pricing and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations including through declining reimbursement rates 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined or regulating pricing contracting and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services additionally on occasion price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing including as a result of pricing controls or legislative efforts at the federal or state level could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the affordable care act aca became law in march 2010 and included numerous reforms affecting reimbursement pricing and contracting for prescription drugs given the scope of the changes made by the aca and continuing implementation controversies we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca 

the aca changed the formula for medicaid federal upper payment limits fuls for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms calculate fuls for multiple source drugs as 175 of the weighted average of average manufacturer price amp with certain exceptions in addition cms regulations require state medicaid programs to implement payment methods for brand nonmultiple source products designed to be consistent with the actual acquisition cost of such drugs effective april 1 2017 medicaid reimbursement for drugs calculated under the final rule may reflect significant reductions from prior reimbursement levels although the impact of the changes varies by state medicaid program any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the aca also amended the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebate percentages and made other changes expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business in addition the bipartisan budget act of 2015 extended to generic drugs inflationbased medicaid drug rebates similar to those that are paid by manufacturers on brand drugs the bipartisan budget act of 2018 subsequently increased the rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs 

there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has had a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional legislative and regulatory changes to the part d program since its enactment on august 29 2018 cms issued guidance which beginning in 2020 would provide flexibility for part d plans to implement indication based formularies that may restrict coverage of certain drugs for certain indications there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

table of contents 

our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians hospitals community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under part b of the medicare program declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some of our customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors although this trend has slowed down in the past several years it could increase in the future due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms reimburses for medicare part b drugs as well as the ability of certain hospitals to purchase drugs at significant statutorilymandated discounts pursuant to the federal 340b drug discount program for groups of patients in addition federal changes in drug reimbursement policy could reduce the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare which could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us and thereby result in corresponding declines in our profitability for example on september 20 2017 cms issued a request for information seeking recommendations for payment models which could include prescription drug models under medicare parts b and d and state medicaid programs additionally cms published a final rule on november 13 2017 that reduces medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug pricing program from average sales price asp plus 6 to asp minus 225 with certain exceptions effective january 1 2018 on july 27 2018 cms published a proposed rule that would reduce from 6 to 3 the “addon” payment for new separatelypayable part b drugs and biologicals that are paid based on wac when asp data during first quarter of sales is unavailable cms also included in its proposed 2019 hospital outpatient prospective system proposed rule published july 31 2018 a request for comments on a potential innovation model that would allow healthcare providers to acquire part b drugs through valuebased agreements with manufacturers administered by privatesector vendors finally on august 7 2018 cms advised medicare advantage plans that they may implement prior authorization “step therapy” or similar utilization controls with respect to part b drugs 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities for instance under the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 as amended a 2 cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

finally federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as medicare and medicaid which may adversely affect our business for example several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increase and to report information relating to those price increases on may 11 2018 the department of health and human services requested comments on a blueprint to lower drug prices and reduce outofpocket costs which outlines a wide range of proposals and policy considerations intended to improve competition lower patient outofpocket costs enhance negotiation and provide incentives for lower manufacturer list prices some of the proposals would require congressional approval and others could be adopted administratively there can be no assurances that future changes to medicare andor medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies drug pricing and contracting practices or government drug price regulation programs such as the medicaid rebate or 340b program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs

public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business 

certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states federal state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the supply chain including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors regarding the distribution of opioid medications in addition a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the supply chain the lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future we are deeply committed to diversion control efforts have sophisticated systems in place to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious including through the use of data analytics and engage in significant due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways including through increased costs and harm to our reputation since these matters are at an early stage we are unable to predict the outcome the adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations and cash flows 

legislative regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict for example in april 2018 the state of new york enacted the opioid stewardship act “osa” which went into effect on july 1 2018 and established an aggregate 100 million annual assessment on all entities that sell or distribute opioid medications in new york in addition other states are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states and may vary in the assessment or tax amounts and the means of calculation from the osa if other state or local jurisdictions enact legislation similar to the osa and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations cash flows or financial condition 

our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings 

we conduct our operations through a variety of businesses including the distribution of pharmaceuticals the dispensing of healthcare products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings involving healthcare fraud and abuse the false claims act antitrust class action commercial employment environmental intellectual property licensing and various other claims including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor litigation is costly timeconsuming and disruptive to ordinary business operations the defense and resolutions of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition violations of various federal and state laws including with respect to the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs any settlement judgment or fine could adversely affect our results of operations 

statutory andor regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of brand andor generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

in fiscal 2018 we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into among other things a corporate integrity agreement see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements the corporate integrity agreement has a fiveyear term failure to comply with obligations under the corporate integrity agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties

our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss or renewal at less favorable terms of a significant customer or group purchasing organization 

wba accounted for approximately 33  of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  express scripts accounted for approximately 13  of our revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  our top ten customers including governmental agencies and gpos represented approximately 68  of revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows additionally from time to time significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration date if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

the anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized 

in may 2016 we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with wba  specifically our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which walgreens boots alliance development gmbh wbad provides a variety of services including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf this reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with wba would result in various benefits including among other things continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the potential inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with wbad including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility potential changes in supplier relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship unforeseen changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to wba and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with wba in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship 

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements dated march 18 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock wba also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as wba has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the shareholder agreement any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with wba many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability if the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected 

if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all 

table of contents 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the us federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives such as the repeal of lastin firstout lifo treatment may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent in addition us federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 the 2017 tax act was enacted and contains significant changes to us income tax law the 2017 tax act includes a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting businesses including lower corporate tax rates changes in business deductions and international tax provisions due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 tax act the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations the subjectivity of factual interpretations the complexity of our intercompany arrangements uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period and other factors material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share as well as our cash flows in the period in which any such adjustments would be made 

the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities to purchase compound store andor distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda doj and various other federal and state authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations governing the sale marketing packaging compounding holding and distribution of controlled substances government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances although we have procedures in place that are intended to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations if we were found to be noncompliant with such laws and regulations federal and state authorities have broad enforcement powers including i the ability to suspend our distribution centers and 503b outsourcing facilities licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products including controlled substances ii seize or recall products and iii impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations specifically enforcement actions may include the doj filing a civil complaint for a consent decree against our pharmedium subsidiary 

we have received and may in the future receive requests for information letters and subpoenas from the dea fda various us attorneys offices of the doj andor state attorneys general and state regulatory authorities and agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances and our order monitoring program which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances or other matters we generally respond to subpoenas requests letters and other authority andor agency correspondence in a thorough and timely manner these responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by us such as costs related to addressing the observations listed on fda form 483 reports such subpoenas requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil criminal or regulatory legal proceedings against us as well as to settlements and the suspension or revocation of registrations required by our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations 

the fda and other governmental entities enforce compliance with applicable current gmp requirements through periodic riskbased inspections it is common for fda form 483 reports to be provided in connection with inspections of 503b outsourcing facilities and fda observations may be followed by warning letters or subsequent enforcement actions prior to our acquisition

of the business pharmedium received a warning letter from the fda in 2014 following the inspection of pharmediums mississippi new jersey tennessee and texas 503b outsourcing facilities in 2013 the fda reinspected all of these facilities in 2015 and 2016 and issued fda form 483 reports at each of the facilities as well as at pharmediums headquarters in lake forest illinois we cannot be assured that the fda and doj will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of pharmediums corrective actions in response to the fdas form 483 reports including pharmediums meeting with the fda on november 18 2016 and as such we cannot predict when or if the fda will consider the agency’s observations to be fully resolved 

in december 2017 following fda inspections of our 503b outsourcing facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities at our largest 503b outsourcing facility located in memphis tennessee we have not resumed commercial distribution at the memphis facility through fiscal 2018 our results of operations were adversely impacted by the memphis suspension and our results of operations will continue to be adversely impacted until the memphis facility resumes commercial distribution we will continue to assess how best to address the remediation needed at the memphis facility and pharmediums other facilities and the impact of pharmedium on our results of operations we continue to be in active communication with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the doj regarding the ongoing compliance efforts of pharmedium including efforts to resume commercial distribution at the memphis facility representatives of the company and pharmedium have had an initial meeting with doj and fda to discuss potential resolution of ongoing matters and whether a consent decree is necessary further discussions are anticipated including with regard to the possible entry of a consent decree separately we have agreed in several state regulatory matters to consent orders or temporary licensing suspensions regarding certain of our 503b outsourcing facilities certain other states have requested information concerning the status of operations at some or all of our 503b outsourcing facilities these state regulatory matters preclude us from commercially distributing into certain states which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 

a failure to adequately address observations identified by the fda in form 483 reports or warning letters issued by the fda or observations identified by any other federal and state regulatory authority including a failure to resolve the observations identified by the fda in the 2014 warning letter and subsequent fda form 483 reports relating to pharmediums 503b outsourcing facilities could lead to the suspension of facilities currently in operation an enforcement action monetary penalties andor license revocation each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations 

the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously and failures or errors in production labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm 

the production labeling and packaging of csps is inherently risky our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps including quality issues manufacturing or labeling flaws improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products any of which could result from human or other error any of these situations could lead to a recall of or safety alert relating to one or more of our products in addition in the ordinary course of business we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products any recall or retrieval whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory authorities could result in significant costs and negative publicity negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare selfregulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings any such action litigation recall or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us because of the increasing cost of insurance coverage we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise

table of contents 

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2018  compared to the year ended september 30 2017   

revenue 



we currently expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the midsingle digits in fiscal 2019 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies including biosimilars the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs price increases and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other thirdparty reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

revenue increased  by 97  from the prior fiscal year primary due to the revenue growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 97  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers overall market growth and especially strong oncology product sales in addition revenue increased in the current fiscal year due to the january 2018 acquisition of hd smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma 

revenue in other increased   102  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil abcss growth in its canadian operations and increased revenue from mwi and world courier offset in part by a decrease in revenue at abcss lash consulting group 

a number of our contracts with customers including group purchasing organizations gpo are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  no significant contracts expired over the next twelve months there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire additionally from time to time other significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration dates if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

gross profit 



gross profit increased   15  or 663 million  from the prior fiscal year gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services and other and an increase  in gains from antitrust litigation settlements gross profit was negatively impacted by an increase in lifo expense in comparison to the prior fiscal year pharmedium remediation costs and an estimated assessment related to the new york state opioid stewardship act 

table of contents 

our costs of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences changes in inventory quantities and product mix many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision lifo expense in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower generic deflation and lower generic inventory levels offset in part by lower brand inflation in comparison to the prior fiscal year 

after fda inspections of our compounding facilities we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at our largest compounding facility located in memphis tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures the suspension of this production facility negatively impacted gross profit in the current fiscal year we have been in active communication with the fda and the consumer protection branch of the civil division of the doj regarding our ongoing compliance efforts at pharmedium and representatives of the company and pharmedium have had an initial meeting with the doj and the fda to discuss potential resolution of ongoing matters and whether a consent decree is necessary see item 1a risk factors on page 8 further discussions are anticipated including with regard to the possible entry of a consent decree 

new york state nys enacted the opioid stewardship act osa which went into effect on july 1 2018 the osa established an annual 100 million opioid stewardship fund the fund and requires manufacturers distributors and importers licensed in nys to ratably source the fund the ratable share of the assessment for each licensee is based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within nys the initial payment to nys is due on january 1 2019 for opioids sold or distributed during calendar year 2017 and future assessments beginning with the 2018 calendar year will be payable quarterly beginning on april 1 2019 the osa expires on june 30 2024 in september 2018 we accrued 220 million as an estimate of our liability under the osa for the period from january 1 2017 through september 30 2018 

pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit increased   89  or 2841 million  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of hd smith offset in part by a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations as it shipped fewer units as we voluntarily suspended production in december 2017 at our memphis facility as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 214  in the current fiscal year decreased   2 basis points from the prior fiscal year the decrease  in gross profit margin from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations and due to increased sales to our larger customers which typically have lower gross profit margins offset in part by the january 2018 consolidation of profarma and the january 2018 acquisition of hd smith 

gross profit in other increased   46  or 559 million  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to world courier and the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil offset in part by lower gross profit at abcs specifically the lash consulting group as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 1990  in the current fiscal year decreased  from 2096  in the prior fiscal year the decline in gross profit margin from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the decrease in gross profit margin at abcs specifically the lash consulting group 

we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of 359 million  and 14 million  during the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold see note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased   156  or 3316 million  from the prior fiscal year as the pharmaceutical distribution services segment expenses increased by 194  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the january 2018 consolidation of profarma the january 2018 acquisition of hd smith and the duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems distribution selling and administrative expenses in other increased by 82  in the current fiscal year primarily to support its revenue growth the january 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in brazil and due to duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems as a percentage of revenue distribution selling and administrative expenses were 146  in the current fiscal year and represents a 7  basis point

depreciation expense increased   198  from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets amortization expense increased   129  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our january 2018 acquisition of hd smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarma

interest expense net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows 



interest expense net increased   203  or 295 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase in interest expense net from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the december 2017 issuance of senior notes to finance our january 2018 acquisition of hd smith and the january 2018 consolidation of profarmas debt and related interest expense average borrowings increased by 5198 million in the current fiscal year in comparison to the prior fiscal year 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

in connection with our incremental brazil investments we adjusted the carrying values of our previously held equity interests in profarma and the specialty joint venture to equal their fair values the adjustments resulted in a loss of 423 million which was comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive loss of 459 million a 124 million gain on the remeasurement of profarmas previously held interest and an 88 million loss on the remeasurement of the specialty joint ventures previously held equity interest see note 2  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 we recorded a 238 million loss on the early retirement of our 400 million of 4875 senior notes that were due in 2019 see note 6  of the notes to consolidated financial statements the loss on the early retirement of the debt included a 223 million prepayment premium and 15 million of an unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs 

our effective tax rates were 372  and 603  in the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018  was primarily impacted by the effect of the 2017 tax act our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 of 4385 million  reflects 6126 million  of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the us federal income tax rate from 35 to 21 both resulting from the 2017 tax act additionally during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2018 we expect that the federal corporate tax rate reduction as a result of the 2017 tax act will continue to favorably impact our effective tax rate compared to prior periods through fiscal 2019 the effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 was negatively impacted by nondeductible legal settlement charges our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018 and 2017 were favorably impacted by our international businesses in switzerland and ireland which have lower income tax rates and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting 

net income attributable to amerisourcebergen corporation was significantly higher in the current fiscal year primarily due to the 2017 tax act and legal settlement charges that were incurred in the prior fiscal year 

year ended september 30 2017 compared to the year ended september 30 2016 

revenue 



revenue increased by 43 from the prior fiscal year primary due to the revenue growth of our pharmaceutical distribution services segment 

table of contents 

the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 41 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in some of its largest customers overall market growth within the retail customer segment and strong growth in sales of oncology products offset in part by a decline in sales of products that treat hepatitis c 

revenue in other increased 104 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased revenue from mwi due to strong growth in its companion animal business and abcs due to its growth in manufacturer service programs 

gross profit 



gross profit increased 64 or 2734 million from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in lifo expense of 3580 million and an increase in gross profit in other offset in part by a decrease in gains from antitrust litigation settlements of 1324 million and a decrease in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services the lifo credit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 was primarily driven by lower brand inflation and greater generic deflation in comparison to the prior fiscal year 

pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit decreased 15 or 500 million from the prior fiscal year gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 was adversely impacted primarily by the kaiser permanente contract renewal effective july 1 2016 at less favorable terms a gpo customer contract renewal effective april 1 2016 at less favorable terms lower price appreciation and a lower contribution from pharmedium as it shipped fewer units while we increased our investment in quality control and quality assurance systems to enhance product quality and patient safety and to meet all of pharmediums commitments to the fda pursuant to the new federal requirements for outsourcing facilities all of which were offset in part by an increase in revenue as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 216 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 decreased 12 basis points from the prior fiscal year the decrease from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the abovementioned contract renewals lower price appreciation and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have a lower gross profit margin 

gross profit in other increased 89 or 982 million from the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to revenue growth of abcs and mwi as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 2096 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 decreased from 2125 in the prior fiscal year 

we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of 14 million and 1338 million during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017 and 2016 respectively 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased 18 or 375 million from the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue was 139 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 a 3 basis point decline compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease in expenses as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to initiatives taken in the second half of fiscal 2016 to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions

depreciation expense increased 117 from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets amortization expense increased 53 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our november 6 2015 acquisition of pharmedium 

there was no warrants expense in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 as the warrants were exercised in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 warrants expense in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 was 1403 million 

employee severance litigation and other in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 included 78 million  of employee severance costs primarily related to position eliminations as we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customers needs litigation costs were 9176 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 and primarily related to litigation settlements and accruals other costs in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 included 170 million  of acquisitionrelated deal and integration costs 133 million  of other restructuring initiatives and 37 million  related to our business transformation efforts

interest expense net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows 



interest expense net increased 38 or 53 million from the prior fiscal year the increase in interest expense net from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in our financing obligations related to leased construction assets offset in part by a decrease of approximately 500 million in average borrowings from the prior fiscal year 

our effective tax rates were 603 and 27 in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017 and 2016 respectively our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 was negatively impacted by legal settlements and accrual charges that we estimated to be nondeductible see note 13  of the notes to consolidated financial statements offset in part by certain discrete items the growth of our international businesses in switzerland and ireland that have significantly lower income tax rates and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting prior to the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation were recorded as adjustments to additional paidin capital within stockholders equity our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 primarily benefited from the receipt of an internal revenue service private letter ruling that entitled us to an income tax deduction equal to the fair value of the warrants on the dates of exercise 

net income attributable to amerisourcebergen corporation was 3645 million and 14279 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017 and 2016 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends the allowance for returns as of september 30 2018 and 2017 was 9888 million and 10017 million respectively 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  was 167 million  89 million  and 131 million  respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2018  allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would 

table of contents 

result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 114 million  the allowance for doubtful accounts was 611 million  and 666 million  as of september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively 

schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

goodwill and other intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives such as certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinitelived intangible assets respectively we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for the current year we may elect to perform the qualitative annual assessment in future periods 

the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure beginning with our operating segments we evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics which include the nature of the components products services and production processes the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers and the components regulatory environment our reporting units include pharmaceutical distribution services profarma abcs world courier and mwi 

we utilize an incomebased approach to value our reporting units with the exception of the profarma reporting unit the fair value of which is based upon its publiclytraded stock price plus an estimated control premium the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we generally believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows andor market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinitelived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  and 2016  we recorded a goodwill impairment of 597 million  in our profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test see note 5 of the notes to consolidated financial 

table of contents 

statements no goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017 and 2016 no indefinitelived intangible impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended september 30 2018 2017 and 2016 

in connection with the goodwill impairment recorded in the profarma reporting unit we first performed a recoverability assessment of profarmas longlived assets by comparing its undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset group and it was determined to be recoverable however the forecasted undiscounted cash flows used to perform the recoverability assessment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions that could differ from actual results in future periods 

we perform a recoverability assessment of our longlived assets when impairment indicators are present 

pharmedium healthcare holdings incs pharmedium longlived assets were also tested for recoverability in fiscal 2018 due to the existence of an impairment indicator we voluntarily suspended production activities in december 2017 at its largest compounding facility located in memphis tennessee after fda inspections of pharmediums compounding facilities we concluded that the suspension of production activity represented an impairment indicator of pharmediums longlived assets and therefore performed a recoverability assessment of pharmediums longlived assets the recoverability assessment was based on the carrying value of the pharmedium asset group excluding goodwill the carrying value of the asset group was 903 million as of september 30 2018 we concluded that pharmediums longlived assets are recoverable as of september 30 2018 however the forecasted undiscounted cash flows used to perform the recoverability assessment are inherently uncertain and include assumptions such as the timing of resumed production activities and profitability that could differ from actual results in future periods 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based upon the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 118 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2018

investments 

we first evaluate our investments in accordance with the variable interest model to determine whether we have a controlling financial interest in an investment this evaluation is made as of the date on which we make our initial investment and subsequent evaluations are made if the structure of the investment changes if it has been determined that an investment is a variable interest entity vie we evaluate whether the vie is required to be consolidated when we hold rights that give us the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entitys economic performance combined with the obligation to absorb an entitys losses and the right to receive benefits we consolidate a vie if it is determined that an investment is not a vie we then evaluate our investments under the voting interest model and generally consolidate investments in which we hold an ownership interest of greater than 50 when we consolidate less than whollyowned subsidiaries we recognize our noncontrolling interest in our consolidated financial statements 

we generally account for ownership interests of between 20 and 50 under the equity method of accounting unrealized losses that are determined to be otherthantemporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made there were no impairment charges on equity investments in the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  2017  or 2016  

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas government investigations and other disputes including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 75  and 80  of our inventories as of september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively has been determined using the lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 15344 million and 14670 million  higher than the amounts reported as of september 30 2018  and 2017  respectively we recorded lifo expense of 673 million  and 2002 million  in the fiscal years ended september 30 2018  and 2016 respectively we recorded a lifo credit of 1578 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision

liquidity and capital resources 

the following illustrates our debt structure as of september 30 2018  including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility the revolving credit note and the overdraft facility

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we had 10 billion  of variablerate debt outstanding as of september 30 2018  we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want andor on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30 2018  

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 24925 million  in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2018  the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling the canadian dollar and the brazilian real revenue from our foreign operations is less than two percent of our consolidated revenue we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes as of september 30 2018  we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c175 million  outstanding note

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by iqvia formerly known as quintilesims an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 44 from 2016 through 2021 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 58 million by 2021 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals  a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 12 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies

legislative developments  in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs in 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details

government regulation 

we are subject to extensive oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the compounding purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances and entities that compound pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing compounding packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances our section 503b outsourcing facilities must comply with current good manufacturing practices gmps and are inspected by the fda periodically to determine that we are complying with such gmps the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers or section 503b outsourcing facilities from distributing pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical compounding and wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our current operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level the supply chain security legislation known as the drug quality and security act “dqsa” became law in 2013 the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities over the next few years the fda and eventually comparable state agencies will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and third party logistics providers one additional change resulting from the dqsa is the creation of 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for providers of compounded sterile preparations csp allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current federal and state requirements for such facilities there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new dqsa requirements or with additional state regulatory and licensing requirements for 503b outsourcing facilities and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our operations into compliance these and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid among other things the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper payment limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price further implementing regulations require state medicaid programs to apply payment mechanisms for branded prescription drugs which are consistent with pharmacies actual acquisition costs for drugs these provisions could reduce prescription drug reimbursement levels under state medicaid programs 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system in addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate our distribution centers or section 503b outsourcing facilities which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

any future reductions in medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

table of contents 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including with respect to the sale transportation storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors below for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and privacy practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information as such term is defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access protected health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the hipaa regulations 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act enacted as part of the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information among other things the hitech act expanded certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rule 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other personal information including sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa the hitech act and the implementing regulations personally identifiable information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate as such regulations continue to evolve we need to comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of these countries including but not limited to those in the european union most notably certain aspects of our business will be subject to the general data protection regulation which becomes effective in the european union on may 25 2018 

there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes and fewer generic pharmaceutical launches 

in fiscal 2017 we experienced unfavorable trends in brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing which negatively impacted our pharmaceutical distribution services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings those trends are expected to continue in fiscal 2018 and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater a decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those in the past could also adversely impact our results of operations 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the “competition” section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers if we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act impose pedigree tracking and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage 2d data matrix barcodes that are applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni for prescription drugs in march 2010 the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drugs in which the fda mandated packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain in november 2013 congress passed the drug quality and security act dqsa the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

one additional change resulting from the dqsa is the creation of section 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for producers of compounded sterile preparations csps allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current dqsa requirements for such facilities however there can be no assurance that 

table of contents 

we are fully compliant with the new requirements and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our csp facilities into compliance moreover the fda will continue to issue draft and final guidance and to promulgate regulations in its efforts to implement the requirements in the dqsa including those relating to current good manufacturing practices gmps and other matters related to 503b outsourcing facilities which may require changes to our csp business some of which may be significant complying with these and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical compounding requirements will increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

legal regulatory and legislative changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined additionally on occasion price increases on certain branded and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing including as a result of pricing controls or legislative efforts at the federal or state level could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act aca became law in march 2010 the aca is intended to expand health insurance coverage including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the aca contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid given the scope of the changes made by the aca and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the aca 

the aca changed the formula for medicaid federal upper payment limits “fuls” for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price amp on february 1 2016 cms published its final rule to implement the acas medicaid covered outpatient drug provisions under which cms calculates fuls for multiple source drugs as 175 of the weighted average of amps with certain exceptions in addition the rule requires state medicaid programs to implement payment methods for brand nonmultiple source products designed to be consistent with the actual acquisition cost of such drugs the rule was generally effective on april 1 2016 and states had until may 2016 to implement the fuls and have until april 1 2017 to implement any changes necessary in light of the actual acquisition cost standard medicaid reimbursement for drugs calculated under the final rule may represent significant reductions from prior reimbursement levels although the impact of the changes depends upon how the changes are implemented by each state medicaid program any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the aca also amended the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and made other changes expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business in addition the bipartisan budget act of 2015 extended to generic drugs inflationbased medicaid drug rebates similar to those that are paid on brand drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs 

there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has had a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional legislative and regulatory changes to the part d program since its enactment there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance under the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 as amended a 2 cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

table of contents 

our business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

our pharmaceutical distribution services segment sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physicians office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some of our customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors although this trend has slowed down in the past year it could increase in the future due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms reimburses for medicare part b drugs as well as the ability of certain hospitals to purchase drugs at significant statutorilymandated discounts pursuant to the federal 340b drug discount program for groups of patients in addition federal changes in drug reimbursement policy could reduce the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare which could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us and thereby result in corresponding declines in our profitability on september 20 2017 cms issued a request for information seeking recommendations for payment models which could include prescription drug models under medicare parts b and d and state medicaid programs cms noted its interest in drug pricing and valuebased purchasing models involving novel arrangements between plans manufacturers and stakeholders across the supply chain additionally cms published a proposed rule on july 20 2016 that would cut medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs other than vaccines purchased through the 340b drug pricing program at average sales price asp minus 225 with certain exceptions rather than asp plus 6 cms finalized this rule on november 1 2017 at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

changes to the us healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing pharmaceutical compounding healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the aca while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs

public concern over the abuse of opioid medications including increased legal and regulatory action could negatively affect our business 

certain governmental and regulatory agencies as well as state and local jurisdictions are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the united states state and local governmental agencies are investigating us other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and others in the supply chain regarding our actions in connection with the distribution of opioid medications in addition multiple lawsuits have been filed against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors alleging among other claims that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations additional governmental entities have indicated an intent to sue we have sophisticated systems in place to detect and report suspicious orders including through the use of data analytics engage in significant due diligence of customers and are committed to diversion control efforts while we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways including through increased costs and harm to our reputation since these matters are at an early stage we are unable to predict the outcome the adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have an adverse effect on our business results of operations cash flows and the price of our common stock 

our business results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation or other legal proceedings

a disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for wba our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with wba if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability if the generics purchasing services arrangement does not continue to be successful our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected

the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities to purchase compound store andor distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations governing the sale marketing packaging compounding holding and distribution of controlled substances government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances although we have procedures in place that are intended to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations if we were found to be noncompliant with such laws and regulations federal and state authorities have broad enforcement powers including i the ability to suspend our distribution centers and 503b outsourcing facilities licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products including controlled substances ii seize or recall products and iii impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations

the fda and other governmental entities enforce compliance with applicable current gmp requirements through periodic riskbased inspections it is common for fda form 483 reports to be provided in connection with inspections of 503b outsourcing facilities and fda observations may be followed by warning letters or subsequent enforcement actions prior to our acquisition of the business pharmedium received a warning letter from the fda in 2014 following the inspection of pharmediums mississippi new jersey tennessee and texas 503b outsourcing facilities in 2013 the fda reinspected all of these facilities in 2015 and 2016 and issued fda form 483 reports at each of the facilities as well as at pharmedium’s headquarters in lake forest illinois we cannot be assured that the fda will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of pharmedium’s corrective actions in response to the fdas form 483 reports including pharmediums meeting with the fda on november 18 2016 and as such we cannot predict when or if the fda will consider the agency’s observations to be fully resolved a failure to adequately address observations identified by the fda in form 483 reports or warning letters issued by the fda or observations identified by any other federal and state regulatory authority including a failure to resolve the observations identified by the fda in the 2014 warning letter and subsequent fda form 483 reports relating to pharmedium’s 503b outsourcing facilities could lead to an enforcement action monetary penalties andor license revocation each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations 

the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously and failures or errors in production labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm 

the production labeling and packaging of csps is inherently risky our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps including quality issues manufacturing or labeling flaws improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products any of which could result from human or other error any of these situations could lead to a recall of or safety alert relating to one or more of our products in addition in the ordinary course of business we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products any recall or retrieval whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory

authorities could result in significant costs and negative publicity negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare selfregulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings any such action litigation recall or reputational harm resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us because of the increasing cost of insurance coverage we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 

we may not realize the expected benefits from our reorganization and other business process initiatives 

in june 2017 we announced a new organizational structure described in the management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item 7 below designed to further align the organization to its customer needs in a more seamless and unified way while supporting corporate strategy accelerating growth and improving efficiency there can be no assurance that we will realize in full or in part the anticipated benefits of these changes our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement from our business optimization initiatives our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits is important to our business success the reorganization and other initiatives could yield unintended consequences such as distraction of our management and employees business disruption attrition inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity which could negatively affect our business sales financial condition and results of operations moreover our restructuring and business process initiatives may result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results there can be no assurance that the activities under any restructuring and business initiative will result in the desired benefits 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

as part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of other companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational experience if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50  countries worldwide we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and the political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability negative trends in the general economy including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2017  compared with year ended september 30 2016   

revenue 



revenue increased  by 43  from the prior fiscal year see discussions below under pharmaceutical distribution services segment and other for commentary regarding our revenue growth 

based on our recently announced plan to acquire hd smith see note 18 of the notes to consolidated financial statements we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2018 to increase between 8 and 11 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies including biosimilars the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs price increases and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

pharmaceutical distribution services segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution services segment grew its revenue by 41  from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenue between legacy abdc and legacy absg has been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution services revenue intrasegment revenues primarily consisted of legacy absg sales directly to legacy abdc customer sites or legacy absg sales to legacy abdc facilities intrasegment revenues were 95 billion  and 76 billion  in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively 

legacy abdcs revenue of 1246 billion   increased   40  from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase  in revenue was primarily due to the growth of some of its largest customers and due to overall market growth within the retail customer segment offset in part by a decline in sales of products that treat hepatitis c 

legacy absgs revenue of 315 billion   increased   105  from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase  in revenue was primarily due to strong overall performance especially in the sale of oncology products and increased sales in our third party logistics business 

a number of our contracts with customers including gpos are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  no significant contracts expired without being renewed over the next twelve months there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire additionally from time to time other significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration dates if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

other 

revenue in other increased   104  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased revenue from mwi due to strong growth in its companion animal business and abcs due to its growth in manufacturer service programs abcs service program revenue growth can be significantly impacted by manufacturer product growth and launches

gross profit 



gross profit increased   64  or 2734 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase  in gross profit from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease  in lifo expense of 3580 million  and an increase  in gross profit in other offset in part by a decrease  in gains from antitrust litigation settlements of 1324 million  and a decrease  in gross profit in pharmaceutical distribution services the lifo credit in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower brand inflation and greater generic deflation for fiscal year ended september 30 2017  in comparison to the prior fiscal year 

our costs of goods sold includes a lifo provision that is affected by expected changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual lifo provision 

pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit decreased   15  or 500 million  from the prior fiscal year gross profit in the current fiscal year was adversely impacted primarily by the prior year kaiser contract renewal effective july 1 2016 at less favorable terms a prior year gpo customer contract renewal effective april 1 2016 at less favorable terms lower price appreciation and a lower contribution from pharmedium as it shipped fewer units while we increased our investment in quality control and quality assurance systems to enhance product quality and patient safety and to meet all of pharmediums commitments to the us food and drug administration fda pursuant to the new federal requirements for outsourcing facilities all of which was offset in part by an increase in revenue as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services gross profit margin of 216  in the current fiscal year decreased   12 basis points from the prior fiscal year the decrease  from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the abovementioned contract renewals lower price appreciation and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have a lower gross profit margin 

gross profit in other increased   89  or 982 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase  was primarily due to revenue growth of abcs and mwi as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 2096  in the current fiscal year decreased  from 2125  in the prior fiscal year 

we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of 14 million  and 1338 million  during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold see note 14  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased   18  or 375 million  from the prior fiscal year and as a percentage of revenue was 139  in the current fiscal year a 3  basis point decline compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease  in expense as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to initiatives taken in the second half of fiscal 2016 to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions 

depreciation expense increased   117  from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of property and equipment placed into service relating to our distribution infrastructure and various technology assets amortization expense increased   53

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  included 381 million  of costs related to employee severance and other costs 9144 million  for litigation settlements and accruals see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further details and 68 million  of dealrelated transaction costs during the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 we began to reorganize to further align our organization to our customers needs in a more seamless and unified way while supporting corporate strategy and accelerating growth and as a result numerous positions were eliminated employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  included 535 million  of employee severance and other costs 192 million  of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the pharmedium acquisition a 171 million  charge related to the transfer of surplus assets from our settled salaried defined benefit pension plan to our defined contribution 401k plan and 130 million  of costs related to customer contract extensions primarily related to the settlement of certain disputed items during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 we reorganized certain of our business units and corporate functions to improve operating efficiency and as a result numerous positions were eliminated 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before gain from antitrust litigation settlements lifo credit expense acquisitionrelated intangibles amortization warrants expense employee severance litigation and other and pension settlement 

pharmaceutical distribution services operating income decreased   35  or 591 million  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decrease  in gross profit as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution services operating income margin of 111 decreased   9  basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the prior year contract renewals at less favorable terms lower price appreciation and increased sales to some of our larger customers that typically have lower gross profit margin offset in part by our initiatives to improve operating efficiency

interest expense net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows 



interest expense net increased   38  or 53 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase in interest expense net from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in our financing obligations related to leased construction assets offset in part by a decrease of approximately 500 million in average borrowings from the prior fiscal year 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

our effective tax rates were 603  and 27  in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  was negatively impacted by legal settlements and accrual charges that we currently estimate to be nondeductible see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements offset in part by certain discrete items the growth of our international businesses in switzerland and ireland that have significantly lower income tax rates and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting prior to the fiscal year ended september 30 2017 tax benefits resulting from sharebased compensation were recorded as adjustments to additional paidin capital within stockholders equity our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  primarily benefited from the receipt of an irs private letter ruling that entitled us to an income tax deduction equal to the fair value of the warrants on the dates of exercise

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  was 89 million  131 million  and 81 million  respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2017  allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 104 million  the allowance for doubtful accounts was 666 million  and 698 million  as of september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively 

table of contents 

business combinations 

the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business are recorded at fair value with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to discount rates and future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

equity investments 

we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in entities in which we have significant influence generally this represents an ownership interest of between 20 and 50 unrealized losses that are determined to be otherthantemporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made we recorded an impairment charge of 306 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 related to our minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil the impairment charge was based upon our determination that the decline in the pharmaceutical wholesalers stock price from the date on which the investment was made to september 30 2015 was otherthantemporary there were no impairment charges on equity investments in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  or 2016  

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets respectively we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of the goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for the current year we also completed a qualitative assessment immediately after our reorganization in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 we may elect to perform the qualitative annual assessment in future periods 

the goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss the amount of which not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit 

we identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure and our reporting units are the same as our operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides 

we utilize an incomebased approach to value our reporting units the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate to determine the fair value of each reporting unit we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows andor market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

table of contents 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  and determined that there were no impairments 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based upon the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 92 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas government investigations and other disputes including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 80  of our inventories as of september 30 2017  and 2016  has been determined using the lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 14670 million and 16248 million  higher than the amounts reported as of september 30 2017  and 2016  respectively we recorded a lifo credit of 1578 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2017  and lifo expense of 2002 million  and 5428 million  in fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision 

table of contents 

sharebased compensation 

we account for the compensation cost of all sharebased payments at fair value we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option expected volatility riskfree interest rate dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based upon historical experience expected volatility is based upon historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility the fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of our common stock and the compensation expense associated with the nonvested performance stock units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of financial targets being achieved and our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based upon the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based upon changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2017  supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 254 million  the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following illustrates our debt structure as of september 30 2017  including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility the revolving credit note and the overdraft facility 



our operating results have generated cash flows which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the repayment of debt fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

as of september 30 2017  and 2016  our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were 9957 million  and 5829 million  respectively and are generally based in us dollar denominated holdings we expect that our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries may continue to grow amounts held outside of the united states are generally utilized

to support nonus liquidity needs including future acquisitions of nonus entities although a portion of these amounts may from time to time be subject to shortterm intercompany loans to us subsidiaries amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the united states we do not have any plans to repatriate these amounts to the united states as our foreign subsidiaries intend to indefinitely reinvest this cash in foreign investments or foreign operations 

we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that depending on our cash balance can require the use of our credit facilities to fund shortterm capital needs our cash balance in the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  needed to be supplemented by intraperiod credit facility borrowings to cover shortterm working capital needs our cash balance in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 also needed to be supplemented by intraperiod credit facility borrowings to cover a portion of the purchase price of pharmedium in advance of securing longterm financing the largest amount of intraperiod borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  and 2016  was 6261 million  and 10182 million  respectively we had 93247 million  83337 million  and 1111 million  of cumulative intraperiod borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30 2017  2016  and 2015  respectively additionally in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 we borrowed 5000 million under our receivables securitization facility that we used to finance principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan see below

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based upon our working capital requirements we had 11 billion  of variablerate debt outstanding as of september 30 2017  we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want andor on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect as of september 30 2017  

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 24351 million  in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2017  the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

  

we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling the canadian dollar and the brazilian real revenue from our foreign operations is approximately one percent of our consolidated revenue we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes as of september 30 2017  we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c276 million  outstanding note

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 71 from 2015 through 2020 and the growth rate is dependent in part on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 55 million by 2020 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals  a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 89 of the prescription volume in the united states 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 12 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

table of contents 

legislative developments  in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs in march 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details 

other economic conditions and certain risk factors could adversely affect our business and prospects see item 1a risk factors on page 9

table of contents 

in march 2013 we and walgreens boots alliance inc wba entered into various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between wba and us pursuant to which we distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to wba and an agreement that provides us the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through a global sourcing arrangement with walgreens boots alliance development gmbh wbad in may 2016 our distribution agreement with wba and our global sourcing arrangement with wbad were extended to now expire in 2026 the increased volume associated with the distribution agreement improved our distribution center efficiency and our access to wbad continues to improve our purchasing power 

in an effort to supplement our organic growth we continue to utilize a disciplined approach to seek acquisitions that will assist us with our strategic growth plans 

in november 2015 we acquired pharmedium healthcare holdings inc pharmedium the leading national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations csps to acute care hospitals in the united states pharmedium is the premier provider of customized outsourced csps that meet specific hospital and physician clinical needs and quality standards in formulations that are not otherwise commercially available pharmedium delivers sterile to sterile csps in a ready to use form with enhanced safety labeling sterility assurance and extended expiration dating supported by appropriate studies that often exceeds what hospital pharmacies can accomplish on their own the csps are prepared in stateoftheart fda and state board of pharmacy inspected facilities using only fdaapproved or allowed drugs in finished dosage form and fdaapproved diluents and fdacleared containers see risk factor — increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  pharmedium maintains four section 503b outsourcing facilities provides a broad range of 2000 skus and serves over 3000 hospital customers across all 50 states the acquisition of pharmedium strengthened our core business and meaningfully expanded our innovative service offerings to our health systems customers

operations 

operating structure  we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2016  are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other see note 17 of the notes to consolidated financial statements for reportable segment information 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment outsourced csps and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and additional consulting services and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals vaccines and other specialty products additionally absg provides third party logistics outcomes research and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refer to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products have historically been a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment the world courier operating segment and the mwi operating segment the results of operations of these operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50  countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom mwi sells pharmaceuticals vaccines parasiticides diagnostics micro feed ingredients and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets 

sales and marketing  the majority of abdcs sales force is led nationally with geographic focus and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdcs marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdcs sales teams and marketing organization also serve national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensure that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their 

table of contents 

needs our other operating segments each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings in addition we have a corporate marketing group that coordinates branding and other marketing activities across the company 

customers  we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities physicians and physician group practices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers and veterinarians we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers 

our two largest customers wba and express scripts inc express scripts accounted for 30  and 16  respectively of our fiscal 2016  revenue our top 10 customers including governmental agencies and group purchasing organizations gpos represented approximately 65  of fiscal 2016  revenue the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

suppliers  we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2016  the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2016  accounted for approximately 45  of our purchases 

information systems  the abdc operating segment operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized enterprise resource planning erp system abdcs erp system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking all of our other operating segments operate the majority of their businesses on their own common centralized erp systems resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities we expect to make significant investments over the next few years to enhance and upgrade the erp systems utilized by our other operating segments 

additionally over the next couple of years we intend to improve our entitywide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency capabilities and speed to market 

we will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology for example in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements see risk factor  increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  we expect to continue to make significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems 

in fiscal 2016 abdc began to make significant investments in its electronic ordering systems these investments will continue into fiscal 2017 abdcs systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing third party claims processing realtime price and incentive updates and price labels 

abdc processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically however it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers abdc has a warehouse operating system which is used to manage the majority of abdcs transactional volume the warehouse operating system has improved abdcs productivity and operating leverage 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services and other third party service providers 

competition 

we face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest competitors are mckesson corporation mckesson and cardinal health inc cardinal abdc competes with both mckesson and cardinal as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in 

table of contents 

which absg engages are also highly competitive absgs operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc and ups logistics among others our abcs world courier and mwi businesses also face competition from a variety of competitors in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2016  we had approximately 19000  employees of which approximately 18000  were fulltime employees approximately 2  of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to extensive oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the compounding purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances and entities that compound pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing compounding packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances our section 503b outsourcing facilities must comply with current good manufacturing practices gmps and are inspected by the fda periodically to determine that we are complying with such gmps the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers or section 503b outsourcing facilities from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical compounding and wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our current operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level congress has enacted legislation to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system by establishing federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level this same legislation establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers and calls for enhanced regulation of csps including heightened compliance reporting labeling and inspection 

table of contents 

standards the legislation also creates section 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for providers of csps allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current legislative requirements for such facilities however there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new requirements and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our csp facilities into compliance these and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid among other things the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price further recent regulations require state medicaid programs to implement payment mechanisms for branded prescription drugs which are consistent with pharmacies actual acquisition costs for drugs these provisions could reduce prescription drug reimbursement levels under state medicaid programs 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system in addition changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate our distribution centers or section 503b outsourcing facilities which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

any future reductions in medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

we are subject to various federal state and local environmental laws including with respect to the sale transportion storage handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors below for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and privacy practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information as such term is defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access protected health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the hipaa regulations 

the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act enacted as part of the 2009 american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information among other things the hitech expanded certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rule 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa the hitech act and the implementing regulations security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 

table of contents 

and such regulations continue to evolve additionally we need to comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of countries throughout the world in which we maintain operations including but not limited to those in the european union 

there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

our results of operations are impacted by prices set by manufacturers and the profitability of future generic pharmaceutical launches 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected a decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those in the past could also adversely impact our results of operations 

in fiscal 2016 we experienced unfavorable trends in brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing those trends are expected to continue in fiscal 2017 and could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations 

competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

as described in greater detail in the “competition” section beginning on page 5 the industries in which we operate are highly competitive in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation including among pharmaceutical manufacturers if we do not compete successfully it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations the impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers suppliers and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer or group purchasing organization 

wba accounted for 30  of our revenue in fiscal 2016  express scripts accounted for 16  of our revenue in fiscal 2016  our top ten customers including governmental agencies and gpos represented approximately 65  of fiscal 2016  revenue we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act impose pedigree tracking and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni in march 2010 the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain in november 2013 

table of contents 

congress passed the drug quality and security act dqsa the dqsa establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug traceability system the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

one additional change resulting from the dqsa is the creation of section 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for producers of compounded sterile preparations “csps” allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with current dqsa requirements for such facilities however there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new requirements and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our csp facilities into compliance moreover the fda continues to issue draft and final guidance in its efforts to implement the requirements in dqsa including those relating to current good manufacturing practices and other matters related to 503b outsourcing facilities which may require changes to our csp business some of which may be significant complying with these and other supply chain of custody and pharmaceutical compounding requirements will increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities to purchase compound store andor distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility or any enforcement action or other litigation that arises out of our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing distribution and 503b outsourcing facilities may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its implementing regulations governing the sale marketing packaging compounding holding and distribution of controlled substances government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances although we have procedures in place that are intended to ensure compliance with such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations if we were found to be noncompliant with such laws and regulations federal and state authorities have broad enforcement powers including i the ability to suspend our distribution centers and 503b outsourcing facilities licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products including controlled substances ii seize or recall products and iii impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations each of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation business and results of operations

legal regulatory and legislative changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined additionally on occasion price increases on certain branded and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries any regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations likewise we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the affordable care act 

the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper limits “fuls” for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price amp on february 1 2016 cms published its final rule with comment period to implement the affordable care act’s medicaid covered outpatient drug provisions under which cms will calculate fuls for multiple source drugs as 175 percent of the weighted average of amps with certain exceptions in addition the rule requires state medicaid programs to implement payment methods for brand nonmultiple source products designed to be consistent with such drugs’ actual acquisition cost “aac” the rule was generally effective on april 1 2016 and states had until may 2016 to implement the fuls and until april 1 2017 to implement any changes necessary in light of the aac standard medicaid reimbursement for drugs calculated under the final rule may represent significant reductions from prior reimbursement levels although the impact of the changes depend upon how the changes are implemented by each state medicaid program any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the affordable care act also amended the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and made other changes expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business in addition the bipartisan budget act of 2015 signed into law on november 2 2015 extended to generic drugs inflationbased medicaid drug rebates similar to those that are paid on brand drugs the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts 

there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has had a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional legislative and regulatory changes to the part d program since its enactment there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance under the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 a 2 cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business

absgs business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physicians office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some of our customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg although this trend has slowed down in the past year it could increase in the future due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms reimburses for medicare part b drugs as well as the ability of certain hospitals to purchase drugs at significant statutorilymandated discounts pursuant to the federal 340b drug discount program for groups of patients in addition federal changes in drug reimbursement policy could reduce the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare which could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us and thereby result in corresponding declines in absgs profitability for instance cms published a proposed rule on march 11 2016 that would establish a program to test new medicare payment methods for certain part b drugs to determine whether alternative payment designs will reduce medicare expenditures while maintaining quality of care that proposed rule has not yet been finalized at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing pharmaceutical compounding healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation or other legal proceedings 

our business involves the manufacture distribution and dispensing of healthcare products which may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale purchase and dispensing of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs any settlement judgment or fine that is in excess of our insurance limits or that is not otherwise covered could adversely affect our results of operations 

table of contents 

among other things statutory andor regulatory violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of branded andor generic pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise 

the company has learned that there are filings in one or more federal district courts that are under seal and may involve allegations against the company andor subsidiaries or businesses of the company including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business relating to its distribution of certain pharmaceutical products to providers with regard to any of these filings our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously and failures or errors in production labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm 

the production labeling and packaging of csps is inherently risky our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps including quality issues manufacturing or labeling flaws improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products any of which could result from human or other error any of these situations could lead to a recall of or safety alert relating to one or more of our products in addition in the ordinary course of business we may voluntarily recall or retrieve products any recall or retreival whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory authorities could result in significant costs and negative publicity negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare selfregulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings any such action litigation recall or reputational harm even recalls or negative publicity resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us because of the increasing cost of insurance coverage we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 

a disruption in our distribution or global sourcing arrangements with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

we act as the primary wholesale distribution source for walgreens pharmacies in the united states with respect to branded and generic prescription drugs we are the primary distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals for wba our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the global sourcing arrangement with wba if the operations of wba are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability if the global sourcing arrangement does not continue to be successful our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected 

if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or global sourcing arrangement there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew on terms favorable to us or at all 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

table of contents 

the anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized 

in may 2016 we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with wba with the expectation that it would result in various benefits including among other things continued cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the potential inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our global sourcing arrangement with wbad including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of this strategic arrangement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility potential changes in supplier relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship unforeseen changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to wba and whether the unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will continue to work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner 

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements dated march 18 2013 to make additional investments in our common stock any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by wba or acquired by wba pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework and shareholder agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

as part of our strategy we have recently completed and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational experience if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including regulatory or compliance issues that could arise changes in regulations and laws the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50  countries worldwide we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and the political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability negative trends in the general economy including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 

we are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care we deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of abdc and absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment outsourced csps and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and additional consulting services and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals vaccines and other specialty products additionally absg provides third party logistics outcomes research and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absgs sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdcs sales of specialty pharmaceutical products have historically been a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the abcs operating segment the world courier operating segment and the mwi operating segment the results of operations of these operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50  countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom mwi sells pharmaceuticals vaccines parasiticides diagnostics micro feed ingredients and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets

recent developments 

in august 2016 we and wba amended the 2017 warrants so that they became exercisable in whole or in part during the six month period beginning in august 2016 at an exercise price of 5250  in august 2016 wba exercised the 2017 warrants and purchased 22696912 shares of our common stock for 11916 million  the earnings per share dilutive effect of the exercise of the warrants was fully mitigated by our hedging a portion of our obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock under special share repurchase programs for our own account over time 

in november 2016 our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to 10 billion in shares of our common stock subject to market conditions

year ended september 30 2016  compared with year ended september 30 2015   

revenue 



revenue increased  by 80  from the prior fiscal year see discussions below under pharmaceutical distribution and other for commentary regarding our revenue growth 

we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2017  to increase between 65 and 8 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including drug utilization the introduction of new innovative brand therapies the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers price increases and price deflation general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by 70  from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution revenue intrasegment revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdc facilities intrasegment revenues were 76 billion  and 64 billion  in the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively 

abdcs revenue of 1198 billion   increased   56  from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase  in abdcs revenue was primarily due to overall market growth including sales to wba revenue in the current fiscal year was negatively impacted by lower sales of products that treat hepatitis c 

absgs revenue of 285 billion   increased   171  from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase  in absgs revenue was due to the continued growth in our oncology business including an increase in sales to community oncologists increased sales in our third party logistics business and increases in our blood products vaccine and physician office distribution businesses 

a number of our contracts with customers including gpos are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer if any existing contract with such customer expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  no significant contracts expired however a significant contract with a gpo was renewed effective april 1 2016 and our agreement with kaiser was renewed for a fiveyear term commencing on july 1 2016 both at less favorable terms than the previous contracts over the next twelve months only one significant contract is scheduled to expire our contract with express scripts expires in september 2017 additionally from time to time other significant contracts may be renewed prior to their expiration dates if those contracts are renewed at less favorable terms they may also negatively impact our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

other 

revenue in other increased   338  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to incremental revenue contribution from mwi which was acquired in february 2015 

table of contents 

gross profit 



gross profit increased   211  or 7433 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase  was due to the increase  in gross profit of pharmaceutical distribution the increase  in the gross profit of other the 3426 million   decrease  in lifo expense from the prior fiscal year and the 683 million   increase  in gain from antitrust litigation settlements from the prior fiscal year the decrease  in lifo expense was primarily due to lower brand inflation and higher generic drug deflation 

our costs of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual lifo provision 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased   29  or 922 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase  was due to the contribution from our recent pharmedium acquisition and the growth of absgs revenue gross profit growth  in the current fiscal year benefited from the incremental income from abdcs participation in the wba global sourcing arrangement and was adversely impacted by lower generic price appreciation an increase in generic price deflation and contract renewals with the dod a significant gpo customer and kaiser all at less favorable terms as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 230  in the current fiscal year decreased   9 basis points from the prior fiscal year the decrease  from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to lower generic price appreciation an increase in generic price deflation contract renewals at less favorable terms and increased sales to our larger customers that typically have a lower gross profit margin 

gross profit in other increased   278  or 2403 million  from the prior fiscal year the increase  was primarily due to the contribution of our february 2015 acquisition of mwi and to a lesser extent the increase in abcss revenue as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 1732  in the current fiscal year decreased  from 1814  in the prior fiscal year the decrease  from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the addition of mwi which has a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within other 

we recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of 1338 million  and 655 million  during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold see note 16 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased   96  or 1834 million  from the prior fiscal year primarily due to our february 2015 acquisition of mwi and to a lesser extent our november 2015 acquisition of pharmedium as a percentage of revenue distribution selling and administrative expenses were 142  in the current fiscal year and represents an increase  of 2  basis points compared to the prior fiscal year the increase  of 2  basis points was primarily due to the addition of mwi which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in comparison to the pharmaceutical distribution segment offset in part by an initiative to improve operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions 

table of contents 

depreciation expense increased   105  from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated amortization expense increased   1699  from prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets originating from our mwi and pharmedium acquisitions 

warrants expense decreased  significantly from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in our stock price since september 30 2015 the warrants were issued in march 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with wba the warrants were exercised by wba in full in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  included 535 million  of employee severance and other costs 192 million  of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the pharmedium acquisition a 171 million  charge related to the transfer of surplus assets from our settled salaried defined benefit pension plan to our defined contribution 401k plan and 130 million  of costs related to customer contract extensions primarily related to the settlement of certain disputed items employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  included 326 million  of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the mwi acquisition and 53 million  of employee severance and other costs

interest expense net increased   283  or 309 million  from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 13 billion  in average borrowings from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the february 2015 issuance of senior notes totaling 10 billion and the february 2015 and november 2015 variablerate term loan borrowings to finance a portion of the mwi and pharmedium acquisitions respectively our average borrowing rate was lower during the current fiscal year primarily as a result of the recent variablerate financings which bear interest at lower rates 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

income taxes were a benefit of 370 million  in fiscal 2016  compared to an expense of 4071 million  in fiscal 2015  in november 2015 we received a private letter ruling from the internal revenue service irs which entitles us to an income tax deduction equal to the fair value of the warrants on the date of exercise as a result we recorded a deferred tax asset and recognized a tax benefit adjustment of approximately 456 million  which represented the estimated benefit from the tax deduction for the increase in the fair value of the warrants from the issuance date through september 30 2015 this tax benefit adjustment had a significant impact to our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  in march 2016 and august 2016 the warrants were exercised by wba and an additional tax benefit of approximately 52 million  was recognized primarily related to the change in the fair value of the warrants from september 30 2015 to their respective exercise dates in fiscal 2016 our income tax rate was also favorably impacted in fiscal 2016 due to the growth of our international service offerings 

net income was 14279 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016  net loss was 1382 million  in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015  net income for the current and prior fiscal years was significantly impacted by warrants expense net of income taxes

table of contents 

absgs revenue of 244 billion increased 243 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in absgs revenue was due to the continued growth in our blood products vaccine and physician office distribution businesses the impact of manufacturer shifts of certain infused oncology products from full line distribution to specialty distribution and growth in oncology product sales including an increase in sales to community oncologists excluding the impact of the manufacturer shifts of certain infused oncology products from full line distribution to specialty distribution absg revenue grew by 152 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015

during fiscal 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 306 million relating to our 199 minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil the impairment charge was based on our determination that the decline in the pharmaceutical wholesalers stock price from the date on which the investment was made to september 30 2015 was otherthantemporary

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  was 131 million  81 million  and 266 million  respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2016  allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would 

table of contents 

result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 92 million  the allowance for doubtful accounts was 698 million and 824 million as of september 30 2016 and 2015 respectively 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2016  supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 239 million  the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas and government investigations including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 79  and 80  of our inventories at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 16248 million and 14246 million  higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2016  and 2015  respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 2002 million  5428 million  and 3481 million  in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict 

equity investments 

we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in entities in which we have significant influence generally this represents an ownership interest of between 20 and 50 unrealized losses that are determined to be otherthantemporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made we recorded an impairment charge of 306 million in fiscal 2015 related to our minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil the impairment charge was based on our determination that the decline in the pharmaceutical wholesalers stock price from the date on which the investment was made to september 30 2015 was otherthantemporary there were no impairment charges on equity investments in fiscal 2016  or 2014 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company including the fair value of any contingent consideration is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates 

table of contents 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives certain trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets we elected to bypass performing the qualitative analysis and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the current year we may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 

the first step in the quantitative process for the goodwill impairment test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill we would be required to record any such impairment losses 

we identify our reporting units based on our management reporting structure and our reporting units are the same as our operating segments generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides 

we utilize an incomebased approach to value the reporting units the incomebased approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization capital expenditures and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill certain trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  and determined that there were no impairments 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option expected volatility riskfree interest rate dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility the fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of our common stock and the compensation expense associated with the nonvested performance stock units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the 

table of contents 

valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 139 million  in fiscal 2016  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2016  including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility the revolving credit note and the overdraft facility in thousands 



our operating results have generated cash flows which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends repurchases of shares of our common stock and our hedging strategy see below for further details 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the repayment of debt fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements

be based in us dollar denominated holdings amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the us we do not have any plans to repatriate these amounts to the us as our foreign subsidiaries intend to indefinitely reinvest this cash in foreign investments or foreign operations 

we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that depending on our cash balance can require the use of our credit facilities to fund shortterm capital needs our cash balance in the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  needed to be supplemented by intraperiod credit facility borrowings to cover shortterm working capital needs our cash balance in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 also needed to be supplemented by intraperiod credit facility borrowings to cover a portion of the purchase price of pharmedium in advance of securing longterm financing the largest amount of intraperiod borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  and 2015  was 10182 million  and 159 million  respectively we had 83337 million   1111 million  and 175845 million  of cumulative intraperiod borrowings under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30 2016  2015  and 2014  respectively additionally in the fiscal year ended september 30 2016 we borrowed 5000 million under our receivables securitization facility that we used to finance principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan see below

we have a receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility which was scheduled to expire in november 2018 in june 2016 we amended the receivables securitization facility to increase the borrowing capacity from 950 million  to 1450 million  and in november 2016 we extended the maturity date to november 2019 in june 2016 we utilized the increased capacity to borrow 500 million  on the receivables securitization facility to finance 500 million  of principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan as the receivables securitization facility bears interest at a lower rate we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million  subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee we pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates annually to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility with which we are compliant as of september 30 2016  

in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a whollyowned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources

settlement which is limited by caps on the market price of our common stock we accounted for the capped calls as equity contracts and therefore the above premiums were recorded as a reduction to paidin capital 

in fiscal 2014 and 2015 we purchased 17741 million of our common stock under special share repurchase programs to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants and supplement our previously executed warrant hedging strategy 

in march 2015 we further supplemented our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which we executed a series of issuer call options call options the call options gave us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices between april 2015 and october 2015 in total we purchased call options on six million shares of our common stock for a total premium of 800 million we accounted for the call options as equity contracts and therefore the above premium was recorded as a reduction to paidin capital

the earnings per share dilutive effect of the warrants was fully mitigated by our hedging a portion of our obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock under the special share repurchase programs as described above for our own account over time 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and financing obligations and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2016  in thousands 



we outsource to ibm global services a significant portion of our corporate and abdc data center operations the remaining commitment under our arrangement which expires in january 2021  is approximately 1128 million  as of september 30 2016  of which 451 million  represents our commitment in fiscal 2017  and is included in other commitments in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 882 million  including interest and penalties as of september 30 2016  this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 

during fiscal 2016  our operating activities provided 31785 million  of cash in comparison to cash provided by operations of 39222 million  in the prior fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal 2016  was principally the result of an increase  in accounts payable of 30115 million  net income of 14279 million  and noncash items of 7224 million  offset in part by an increase  in accounts receivable of 9127 million  and an increase  in merchandise inventories of 11073 million  the noncash items were comprised primarily of 2325 million  of depreciation expense 2002 million  of lifo expense and 1596 million  of amortization expense the increase  in accounts payable was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers accounts receivable and merchandise inventories increased as a result of our overall revenue growth

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

we use days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance the below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends 



the increase in days payable outstanding from fiscal 2015  to fiscal 2016  has benefited from the increase in purchases of merchandise inventories from certain pharmaceutical manufacturers with longer payment terms 

our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital additionally any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations we expect our days sales outstanding to increase in fiscal 2017 as a result of a gradual change in payment terms with our largest customer operating cash flows during fiscal 2016  included 1235 million  of interest payments and 175 million  of income tax payments net of refunds operating cash flows during fiscal 2015  included 915 million  of interest payments and 2996 million  of income tax payments net refunds

capital expenditures in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  were 4646 million  2316 million  and 2645 million  respectively significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 included costs associated with expanding distribution capacity technology initiatives including costs related to the development of trackandtrace technology and the expansion of support facilities significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 included technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our primary erp system costs associated with building our new national distribution center and expansion of support facilities significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 included infrastructure and technologyrelated costs to onboard the incremental wba distribution volume costs associated with building our new national distribution center and other technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our primary erp system 

we currently expect to spend approximately 500 million  for capital expenditures during fiscal 2017  larger 2017  capital expenditures include building new distribution centers andor replacing or upgrading existing distribution centers information system investments to support a data center consolidation trackandtrace technology and a new operating system for certain business units 

cost of acquired companies net of cash acquired in fiscal 2016 was 27314 million  and primarily consisted of our pharmedium acquisition cost of acquired companies net of cash acquired in fiscal 2015 was 26334 million  and primarily consisted of our mwi acquisition in fiscal 2014 we invested 1178 million to acquire a minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil and to form a specialty joint venture with the same entity in fiscal 2016 we invested an additional 172 million  in that same pharmaceutical wholesaler and specialty joint venture 

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016  included 23605 million  received upon the exercise of the warrants by wba and 10 billion of borrowings under our november 2015 term loan we used a portion of the proceeds from the exercise of the warrants to purchase our common stock under our special share repurchase program in fiscal 2016  2015  and 2014  we paid 22663 million  18591 million  and 7539 million  respectively for purchases of our common stock we used the proceeds from the november 2015 term loan to fund a portion of our november 2015 acquisition of pharmedium 

table of contents 

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 included 10 billion of borrowings under our february 2015 term loan and 9964 million of proceeds related to the february 2015 issuance of our 2025 notes and 2045 notes we used the proceeds from these financing activities to fund a portion of our february 2015 acquisition of mwi 

 in fiscal 2015  and 2014  we paid 1800 million  and 2114 million  respectively to purchase or amend capped calls and call options to hedge the potential dilution associated with the warrants upon their exercise 

our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases 



we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors 

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements in fiscal 2016  we used a 10 billion variable rate term loan to finance a portion of the pharmedium acquisition price we also borrowed 500 million from the receivables securitization facility to finance 500 million  of principal payments that we elected to make on the november 2015 term loan we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want andor on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2016  

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 27418 million  in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2016  the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

  

we have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling the canadian dollar and the brazilian real revenue from our foreign operations is less than one percent of our consolidated revenue we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes as of september 30 2016  we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c374 million  outstanding note

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc ims an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow approximately 72 annually from 2015 through 2019 primarily due to strong demand favorable pricing and new product introductions 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

  aging population the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 53 million by 2019 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

  increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 85 of the prescription volume in the united states 

  increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 11 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

  legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs in march 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which increased the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details 

the company 

we currently serve our customers healthcare providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain specialty drug patients through a geographically diverse network of distribution service centers and other operations in the united states and selected global markets in our pharmaceutical distribution business we are typically the primary source of supply of pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers we offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations which allows them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel 

strategy 

our business strategy is focused on the global pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide valueadded distribution and service solutions to healthcare providers primarily pharmacies health systems medical and dialysis clinics physicians and veterinarians and pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase channel efficiencies and improve patient outcomes implementing this disciplined focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business and we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy

our provider solutions include our good neighbor pharmacy® program which enables independent community pharmacies to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs elevate provider network® our managed care network which connects our retail pharmacy customers to payor plans throughout the country and is one of the largest in the us generic product purchasing and private label services hospital pharmacy consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies and packaging solutions for institutional and retail healthcare providers 

in march 2013 we and walgreens boots alliance inc wba entered into various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between wba and us pursuant to which we will distribute branded and generic pharmaceutical products to wba and an agreement that provides us the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through a global sourcing arrangement with walgreens boots alliance development gmbh wbad the increased volume associated with the distribution agreement improved our distribution center efficiency and our access to wbad is expected to continue to improve our purchasing power 

in an effort to supplement our organic growth we continue to utilize a disciplined approach to seek acquisitions that will assist us with our strategic growth plans 

in november 2015 we acquired pharmedium healthcare holdings inc pharmedium the leading national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations csps to acute care hospitals in the united states pharmedium is the premier provider of customized outsourced csps that meet specific hospital and physician clinical needs and quality standards in formulations that are not otherwise commercially available pharmedium delivers sterile to sterile csps in a ready to use form with enhanced safety labeling sterility assurance and extended expiration dating supported by appropriate studies that often exceeds what hospital pharmacies can accomplish on their own the csps are prepared in stateoftheart fda and state board of pharmacy inspected facilities using only fdaapproved or allowed drugs in finished dosage form and fdaapproved diluents and fdacleared containers see risk factor — increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  pharmedium maintains 4 compounding facilities provides a broad range of 2000 skus and serves over 3000 hospital customers across all 50 states the acquisition of pharmedium strengthens our core business and meaningfully expands our innovative service offerings to our health systems customers 

• optimize and grow our specialty distribution and service businesses our specialty pharmaceuticals business has a significant presence in this growing part of the pharmaceutical supply channel with distribution and valueadded services to physicians and other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics our specialty pharmaceuticals business is a welldeveloped platform for growth we are a leader in distribution and services to community oncologists and have leading positions in other physicianadministered products we also distribute plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines additionally we are wellpositioned to service and support many of the new biotechnology therapies that will be coming to market in the near future we continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in specialty distribution and services in fiscal 2014 we expanded globally by acquiring a minority ownership in profarma distribuidora de produtos farmacêuticos sa profarma a leading pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil in addition we launched a joint venture with profarma to provide enhanced specialty distribution and services to the brazilian marketplace 

• optimize and grow our manufacturer services businesses our consulting service businesses help global pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers commercialize their products in the channel we believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies in supporting access to branded drugs we also provide outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical companies world courier group inc world courier is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry world courier further strengthens our service offerings to global pharmaceutical manufacturers and provides an established platform for the introduction of our specialty services outside north america we continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in consulting and other services • enter into the animal health distribution and service business in february 2015 we acquired mwi veterinary supply inc mwi a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom mwi sells pharmaceuticals vaccines parasiticides diagnostics micro feed ingredients and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets mwi also offers its customers a variety of valueadded services including its ecommerce platform technology management systems pharmacy fulfillment inventory management system equipment procurement consultation special order fulfillment and educational seminars which we believe closely integrate mwi with its customers daytoday operations and provide them with meaningful incentives to continue doing business with mwi we continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in animal health distribution and services 3 

• divestitures in order to allow us to concentrate on our strategic focus areas of pharmaceutical distribution and related services and specialty pharmaceutical distribution and related services we have divested certain noncore businesses and may from time to time consider additional divestitures operations 

  operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2015 are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals vaccines and other specialty products additionally absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products have historically been a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment the world courier group inc world courier operating segment and the mwi veterinary supply inc mwi operating segment the results of operations of these operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom mwi sells pharmaceuticals vaccines parasiticides diagnostics micro feed ingredients and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets 

  sales and marketing the majority of abdcs sales force is led nationally with geographic focus and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdcs marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdcs sales teams and marketing organization also serve national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our other operating segments each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings in addition we have a corporate marketing group that coordinates branding and other marketing activities across the company 

  customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physicians and physician group practices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers and veterinarians we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers 

our two largest customers wba and express scripts inc express scripts accounted for 30 and 16 respectively of our fiscal 2015 revenue our top 10 customers including governmental agencies and group purchasing organizations gpos represented approximately 64 of fiscal 2015 revenue the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

  suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2015 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2015 accounted for approximately 46 of our purchases 

  information systems the abdc operating segment operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized enterprise resource planning erp system abdcs erp system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdcs systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing third party claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc has a warehouse operating system which is used to manage the majority of abdcs transactional volume the warehouse operating system has improved abdcs productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services and other third party service providers 

our other operating segments operate the majority of their businesses on their own common centralized erp systems resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities 

we expect to continue to enhance and upgrade our erp systems in addition in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements see risk factor — increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  we expect to continue to make significant investments in our information systems 

competition 

we face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest competitors are mckesson corporation mckesson and cardinal health inc cardinal abdc competes with both mckesson and cardinal as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absgs operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc and ups logistics among others our abcs world courier and mwi businesses also face competition from a variety of competitors in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2015 we had approximately 17500 employees of which approximately 16500 were fulltime employees approximately 3 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the compounding purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances and entities that compound pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing compounding packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution and compounding centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical compounding and wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level congress has enacted legislation to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system by establishing federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level this same legislation establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers and calls for enhanced regulation of compounded sterile preparations csps including heightened compliance reporting labeling and inspection standards the legislation also creates section 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for providers of csps allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda these and other requirements are expected to increase the cost of our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid in addition among other things the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price however that change has not yet been implemented by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the production delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system 

any future reductions in medicare or medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and privacy practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its accompanying federal regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of individually identifiable health information as such term is defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access individually identifiable health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

enacted in 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect individually identifiable health information a section of the arra known as the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act strengthened certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rules 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa the hitech act and the regulations implemented thereunder security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate and such regulations continue to evolve additionally we need to comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of countries throughout the world in which we maintain operations including but not limited to those in the european union 

there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit 

the industries in which we operate including distribution of human and animal health pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions are highly competitive our distribution competitors include two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals mckesson and cardinal regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals national generic distributors chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers and national regional local and specialty distributors our other competitors include logistics repackaging and healthcare technology companies and producers of compounded sterile preparations see competition on page 6 if we do not compete successfully against these and other organizations it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers suppliers and competitors it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

  our results of operations are impacted by prices set by manufacturers and the profitability of future generic pharmaceutical launches 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases which we do not control if the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected a decline in the number of generic pharmaceutical launches or launches that are less profitable than those in the past could also adversely impact our results of operations 

  declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability negative trends in the general economy including interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

if the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing impair our liquidity or adversely impact our business 

  our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2015 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 40 and 10 of accounts receivable net 

  our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

wba accounted for 30 of our revenue in fiscal 2015 express scripts accounted for 16 of our revenue in fiscal 2015 our top ten customers including governmental agencies and group purchasing organizations gpos represented approximately 64 of fiscal 2015 revenue we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

  if wba exercises its rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants could dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in connection with our strategic relationship with wba we entered into a framework agreement with affiliates of wba dated as of march 18 2013 the framework agreement pursuant to which i subsidiaries of wba were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen beginning with the right but not the obligation to purchase up to 19859795 shares of our common stock approximately 7 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming the exercise in full of the warrants described below in open market transactions with the right to designate up to two members of our board of directors upon achieving specified ownership levels ii walgreens pharmacy strategies llc a wholly owned subsidiary of wba was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 and iii alliance boots luxembourg sàrl also a wholly owned subsidiary of wba was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 collectively the warrants the warrants collectively represent approximately 16 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming exercise in full of the warrants the number of shares which may be purchased in the open market is subject to increase in certain circumstances if the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of the first tranche of warrants when those warrants are exercisable in 2016 in such event the incremental number of shares purchased in the open market would reduce shareforshare the number of shares exercisable pursuant to the first tranche of warrants 

future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders in addition the dilutive effect of the warrants will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share during the period that the warrants are outstanding a decrease in our diluted earnings per share could in turn adversely affect the market value of our common stock in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock acquired pursuant to open market purchases by wba or issuable upon the exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for steps taken to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that the exercise of the warrants could have on our then existing shareholders 

  a disruption in our distribution arrangement with wba could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in march 2013 we entered into a tenyear distribution agreement with wba to act as its primary wholesale distribution source for walgreens pharmacies in the united states with respect to branded and generic prescription drugs we are the primary distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals for wba if the operations of wba are seriously 

disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit wba for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or wba will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that wba experiences including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

  the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with wba may not be realized 

we entered into the arrangement with wba with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming many of the anticipated benefits and expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits resulting from participation in our global sourcing arrangement with wbad due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of this strategic arrangement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility the potential changes in supplier and customer relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship and whether the unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner 

in addition wba has the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements to invest in our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework and shareholder agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock 

  increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system and pharmacy compounding activities regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution and pharmaceutical compounding for example there are new and significantly elevated state regulatory requirements designed to increase the quality and raise the oversight of hospital pharmacies and other producers of compounded sterile preparations csps 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act impose pedigree tracking and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni in march 2010 the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain in november 2013 congress passed the drug quality and security act dqsa the dqsa establishes federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug track and trace system the dsqa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers including licensing requirements in states that had not previously licensed such entities 

the dqsa also establishes new requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third party logistics providers and calls for enhanced regulation of csps including heightened compliance reporting labeling and inspection standards one change resulting from the dqsa is the creation of section 503b outsourcing facilities as a new category for providers of csps allowing such facilities to voluntarily register with the fda our csp business locations have registered with the fda as section 503b outsourcing facilities and have implemented policies and procedures to achieve compliance with the dqsa requirements for such facilities however there can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the new requirements and any failure to comply may result in additional costs to bring our csp facilities into compliance moreover the fda continues to issue draft and final guidance under the dqsa including those relating to current good manufacturing practices which may require changes to our csp business some of which may be significant complying with these and other supply chain of custody and pharmaceutical compounding requirements will increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 

  the suspension or revocation by federal or state authorities of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution and compounding facilities to purchase store and distribute pharmaceuticals and controlled substances or the refusal by such authorities to issue a registration to any such facility may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances and the compounding of pharmaceuticals that contain controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging compounding holding and distribution of controlled substances government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances we have received and may in the future receive requests for information letters and subpoenas from the dea fda various united states attorneys offices of the united states department of justice andor state regulatory agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances our order monitoring program which is designed to prevent and detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances or other matters 

the fda and other governmental entities enforce compliance with applicable cgmp requirements and sterile product requirements under applicable state law through periodic riskbased inspections it is common for fda form 483 reports to be provided in connection with inspections of compounding outsourcing facilities and fda observations may be further followed by warning letters and other enforcement actions as the fda deems warranted for example prior to our acquisition of the business pharmedium received a warning letter from the fda in 2014 following the inspection of pharmediums mississippi new jersey tennessee and texas outsourcing facilities in 2013 the fda reinspected these facilities in 2015 

we generally respond to such subpoenas requests and letters in a thorough and timely manner these responses require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the company such subpoenas requests and letters can also lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil criminal or regulatory legal proceedings against the company as well as to settlements which can be material 

the dea fda and other federal and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including i the ability to suspend our distribution centers and outsourcing facilities licenses to distribute and compound pharmaceutical products including controlled substances ii seize or recall products and iii impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations although we have procedures intended to ensure compliance there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would conclude that our operations are compliant with applicable laws and regulations and any noncompliance could lead to litigation and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations with respect to the fda warning letter issued to pharmedium in 2014 we cannot be assured that the fda will be satisfied with the sufficiency or timing of pharmediums corrective actions and as such we cannot predict when or if the fda will consider the matters described in the 2014 warning letter or any matters raised during 2015 onsite inspections to have been fully resolved 

  legal regulatory and legislative changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined additionally on occasion price increases on certain branded and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries any regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others will be implemented over time given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations 

the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price amp while the draft federal upper limit prices and methodology released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits currently in place the impact of the changes cannot be determined until cmss methodology is finalized and may also depend upon how the changes are implemented by each state medicaid program any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and makes other changes expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business cms issued proposed regulations to implement the affordable care acts provisions regarding medicaid rebates and medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies but the regulations have not been finalized to date the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts for example a number of states have announced plans to use average acquisition cost to reimburse pharmacies for the cost of drugs cms also has been conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average actual pharmacy acquisition costs the results of which states may use to determine statespecific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates 

there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has had a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional legislative and regulatory changes to the part d program since its enactment there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance under the sequestration provision of the budget control act of 2011 a 2 cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  absgs business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physicians office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some of our customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg although this trend has slowed down in the past year it could increase in the future due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms calculates average sales price for medicare part b drugs as well as the ability of certain hospitals to purchase drugs at significant statutorilymandated discounts pursuant to the federal 340b drug discount program in addition federal changes in drug reimbursement policy could reduce the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare which could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us and thereby result in corresponding declines in absgs profitability at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing pharmaceutical compounding healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

  if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of branded andor generic pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise 

the company has learned that there are filings in one or more federal district courts including a qui tam complaint filed by one of our former employees that are under seal and may involve allegations against the company andor subsidiaries or businesses of the company including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business relating to its distribution of certain pharmaceutical products to providers with regard to any of these filings our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

as part of our strategy we have recently completed and expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational experience if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in regulations and laws the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities including litigation risks the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50 countries worldwide we may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws regulations and the political and economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension 

or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems and third party service providers are also responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems to the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data damage our reputation increase our costs andor cause losses as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

  risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data 

we are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the united states and beyond that regulate the collection use and transfer of personal data including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries many of these foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the united states we may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties that or other circumstances related to our collection use and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market andor adversely affect our business and financial position 

  tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states and select global markets as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives such as the repeal of lastin firstout lifo treatment may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives we believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws regulations and existing precedent in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

  natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and may not be covered by insurance 

the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the us or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance natural disasters power outages or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of products delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers andor disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers existing insurance arrangements may not provide protection for the costs that may arise from such events particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in 

combination any longterm disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations 

  our goodwill or intangible assets may become impaired which would require us to record a significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

us generally accepted accounting principles gaap require us to test our goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results significant negative industry or economic trends or a significant decline in the companys stock price andor market capitalization for a sustained period of time in addition we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates the loss of a significant customer or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value the testing required by gaap involves estimates and judgments by management although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate any changes in key assumptions including a failure to meet business plans or other unanticipated events and circumstances such as a rise in interest rates may affect the accuracy or validity of such estimates we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets is determined any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 

  the products compounded by our csp business are administered by our customers to patients intravenously and failures or errors in production labeling or packaging could contribute to patient harm or death which may subject us to significant liabilities and reputational harm 

the production labeling and packaging of csps is inherently risky our csp business sells csps to acute care hospitals freestanding hospital outpatient departments and ambulatory surgery centers who then administer the csps to patients intravenously or through other injectable routes of administration there are a number of factors that could result in the injury or death of a patient who receives one of our csps including quality issues manufacturing or labeling flaws improper packaging or unanticipated or improper uses of the products any of which could result from human or other error any of these situations could lead to a recall of or safety alert relating to one or more of our products in addition in the ordinary course of business we may voluntarily retrieve products any retrieval or recall whether voluntary or requested by the fda or state regulatory authorities could result in significant costs and negative publicity negative publicity including regarding a quality or safety issue whether accurate or inaccurate could reduce market acceptance of our products harm our reputation decrease demand for our products result in the loss of customers lead to product withdrawals and harm our ability to successfully launch new products and services these problems could also result in enforcement actions by state and federal authorities or other healthcare selfregulatory bodies or product liability claims or lawsuits including those brought by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class or establish multidistrict litigation proceedings any such action litigation recall or reputational harm even recalls or negative publicity resulting from patient harm or death caused by csps prepared by a competitor or a hospital pharmacy could result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and liquidity our current or future insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us because of the increasing cost of insurance coverage we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 

we are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care we deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals vaccines and other specialty products additionally absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products have historically been a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment the world courier group inc world courier operating segment and the mwi veterinary supply inc mwi operating segment the results of operations of these operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry mwi is a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom mwi sells pharmaceuticals vaccines parasiticides diagnostics micro feed ingredients and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets 

recent developments 

on november 6 2015 we acquired pharmedium healthcare holdings inc pharmedium a privately held leading national provider of outsourced compounded sterile preparations csps to acute care hospitals in the united states for 27 billion in cash which included certain purchase price adjustments we financed the transaction through a combination of cash and longterm debt in november 2015 we entered into a 10 billion variable rate term loan which matures in november 2020 and is subject to quarterly principal payments as defined pharmedium is considered a component of abdc within our pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment 

executive summary 

this executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follows 

• revenue increased 137 from the prior fiscal year as a result of a full year of generic drug distribution to wba in fiscal 2015 increased sales of brand and generic products and the strong growth of absg and abcs additionally the acquisition of mwi contributed to our revenue growth in the current fiscal year • pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased 133 from the prior fiscal year as the result of our strong revenue growth in brand and generic pharmaceuticals in abdc and absg and the incremental income from abdcs participation in the global sourcing arrangement with wbad gross profit growth in the current fiscal year was adversely impacted by the renewal of our contract with the department of defense dod at less favorable terms and lower generic price appreciation • total gross profit was impacted by lifo expense which was 5428 million in comparison to 3481 million in the prior fiscal year the increase in lifo expense was primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generic drug deflation resulting from the generics pricing environment • distribution selling and administrative expenses increased 208 from the prior fiscal year to support our revenue growth additionally these expenses were greater in the current fiscal year due to the addition of mwi • total operating expenses were impacted by warrants warrant expense was 9127 million in the current fiscal year compared to 4227 million in the prior fiscal year warrant expense increased significantly from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in our stock price since september 30 2014 • total segment operating income increased by 220 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in pharmaceutical distributions gross profit and the addition of mwi and • net loss and diluted loss per share in the current fiscal year were impacted by the significant lifo and warrant expense 26 

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2015 compared with year ended september 30 2014 

revenue 



revenue increased by 137 from the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased sales to wba of 73 billion from the prior fiscal year fiscal 2014 revenue included the gradual phase in of the wba generics business beginning in january 2014 excluding the incremental sales to wba our revenue increased by 76 from the prior fiscal year see discussion below under pharmaceutical distribution and other for additional commentary regarding our revenue growth 

we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2016 to increase in the range of 8 and 10 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the introduction of new innovative brand therapies the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by 120 from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution revenue intrasegment revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdcs facilities intrasegment revenues were 64 billion and 42 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively 

abdcs revenue of 1135 billion increased 113 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in abdcs revenue was primarily due to increased sales to wba of 73 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 as noted above increased sales of products that treat hepatitis c and overall market growth 

absgs revenue of 244 billion increased 243 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in absgs revenue was due to the continued growth in our blood products vaccine and physician office distribution businesses the impact of manufacturer shifts of certain infused oncology products from full line distribution to specialty distribution and growth in oncology product sales including an increase in sales to community oncologists excluding the impact of the manufacturer shifts of certain infused oncology products from full line distribution to specialty distribution absg revenue grew by 152 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 

a portion of absgs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology community oncologists and other specialty physicians that administer drugs under medicare part b have been impacted by lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmaceutical drugs absgs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals especially oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in revenue reductions refer to item 1a risk factors in this report for a more detailed description of this business risk 

a number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations gpos are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 no significant contracts expired over the next twelve months the two significant contracts scheduled to expire are our contracts with kaiser permanente kaiser which expires in june 2016 and express scripts which expires in september 2016 our revenue results of operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted if the kaiser or express scripts contracts are not renewed or the terms of the renewed contracts are less favorable than the existing contracts 

other 

revenue in other increased 949 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 19 billion revenue contribution from mwi and an increase in abcs revenue 

gross profit 



gross profit increased 183 or 5469 million from the prior fiscal year the increase was due to the increase in pharmaceutical distribution gross profit the increase in the gross profit of other and larger gains on antitrust litigation settlements and was offset in part by the 1947 million increase in lifo expense from the prior fiscal year the increase in lifo expense was primarily due to higher brand inflation and lower generic drug deflation resulting from the generics pricing environment 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased 133 or 3699 million from the prior fiscal year the increase was due to higher brand and generic sales volume largely attributable to wba as noted above gross profit also increased due to the growth of our specialty distribution businesses and an increase in income resulting from our participation in our global sourcing arrangement with wbad gross profit growth in the current year was adversely impacted by the renewal of our contract with the dod at less favorable terms and lower generic price appreciation as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 239 in the current fiscal year increased 3 basis points from the prior fiscal year the increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in abdc and absg sales volume and incremental income from our participation in our global sourcing arrangement with wbad 

gross profit in other increased 618 or 3308 million from the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the contribution of our mwi acquisition and to a lesser extent the increase in abcs and world couriers revenue as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 1814 in the current fiscal year decreased from 2184 in the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the contribution from our mwi acquisition and the increase in abcs distribution revenue both of which have a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within other 

we recognized gains of 655 million and 244 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold see note 14 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict we recorded lifo expense of 5428 million and 3481 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expenses increased 208 or 3308 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the fiscal 2015 acquisition of mwi in addition operating expenses during the current fiscal year were higher to support the increase in our revenue including the wba volume which was not fully phased in during the prior fiscal year more specifically expenses related to payroll including incentive compensation delivery and information technology were higher in the current fiscal year as a percentage of revenue distribution selling and administrative expenses were 141 in the current fiscal year and represent an increase of 8 basis points in comparison to the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of mwi which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in comparison to pharmaceutical distribution 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated amortization expense increased from prior fiscal year primarily due to the amortization of newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the mwi acquisition 

warrant expense increased significantly from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in our stock price since september 30 2014 the warrants were issued in march 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with wba warrant expense is largely dependent upon changes in our stock price therefore future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly refer to critical accounting policies and estimates — warrants in this report for a more detailed description of the accounting for the warrants 

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 included 326 million of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the mwi acquisition and 53 million of employee severance and other costs employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 included 63 million of dealrelated transaction costs and 19 million of employee severance and other costs 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements lifo expense acquisitionrelated intangibles amortization warrant expense and employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased 170 or 2389 million from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in gross profit offset in part by the increase in operating expenses from the prior fiscal year as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution operating income margin increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in abdc and absg sales volume and incremental income from our participation in the global sourcing arrangement with wbad and was offset in part by the dod contract renewal and a decrease in generic price appreciation 

operating income in other increased 690 or 1039 million from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of the contribution of our fiscal 2015 mwi acquisition 

interest expense interest income and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense net increased 288 or 221 million from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 14 billion in average borrowings primarily due to the february 2015 issuance of our 500 million 325 senior notes our 500 million 425 senior notes and our variablerate term loan borrowing to finance a portion of the mwi acquisition our average borrowing rate was lower during the current fiscal year primarily as a result of the recent financings which bear interest at lower rates 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash we currently expect our interest expense in fiscal 2016 to increase due to a full year of borrowings related to the mwi acquisition and the incremental financing to acquire pharmedium 

during fiscal 2015 we recorded an impairment charge of 306 million relating to our 199 minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil the impairment charge was based on our determination that the decline in the pharmaceutical wholesalers stock price from the date on which the investment was made to september 30 2015 was otherthantemporary 

income tax expense was 4090 million in fiscal 2015 compared to 3894 million in fiscal 2014 and was determined based on our taxable income as of september 30 2015 a significant portion of warrant expense was not tax deductible as a result our effective tax rate fluctuated significantly due to changes in the valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes see note 18 — subsequent events for recent developments regarding the tax treatment of the warrants 

net loss was 1349 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 diluted loss per share of 062 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 was driven primarily due to the significant warrant expense and lifo expense 

year ended september 30 2014 compared with year ended september 30 2013 

revenue 



revenue of 1196 billion in fiscal 2014 increased 359 from the prior fiscal year this increase was largely due to the revenue growth of pharmaceutical distribution and to a lesser extent the revenue growth of other 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by 364 from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution revenue these revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdcs facilities total intrasegment revenues were 42 billion and 34 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively 

abdcs revenue of 1019 billion increased 420 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in abdcs revenue was primarily due to increased sales to wba of 250 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 and increased sales including new hepatitis c drugs to some of our other larger customers 

absgs revenue of 196 billion increased 111 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations primarily due to increased sales of certain specialty products and growth in its blood products vaccine and specialty distribution businesses the specialty distribution business benefited from sales of an ophthalmology drug 

other 

revenue in other increased 173 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to our distribution business within abcs which benefited from the launch of two new products in the middle of the prior fiscal year increased revenue from world courier also contributed to the fiscal 2014 revenue growth 

gross profit 



gross profit increased 189 or 4745 million from the prior fiscal year 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased 219 or 4984 million from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the higher brand and generic sales volume to wba brand and generic price appreciation and the growth of our noncommunity oncology specialty distribution businesses gross profit in fiscal 2014 also benefited from income resulting from our participation in the global sourcing arrangement with wbad as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 236 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 decreased 28 basis points from the prior fiscal year the pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin decline was primarily due to a significant increase in lower margin business with wba and some of our other larger customers and competitive pressures on customer margins 

gross profit in other increased 93 or 457 million from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved gross margin in world courier and higher revenue in abcs distribution business as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 2184 decreased from 2343 in the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to an increase in abcs distribution revenue which has a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within other these decreases were offset in part by increases in the gross profit margin of world courier 

we recognized gains of 244 million and 229 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 

we recorded lifo expense of 3481 million and 2770 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expense increased 190 or 2535 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the onboarding of our distribution agreement with wba more specifically expenses related to payroll information technology and delivery were higher in the current fiscal year 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated amortization expense was comparable to the prior fiscal year 

warrant expense was 4227 million and 901 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively 

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 included 63 million of dealrelated transaction costs and 19 million of employee severance and other costs employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 included 230 million of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the wba transaction and 05 million of employee severance and facility closure costs 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 184 in fiscal 2014 up 1 basis point from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the larger warrant expense in the current fiscal year offset in part by economies of scale as a result of the increased revenue provided by the walgreens distribution agreement 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements lifo expense acquisitionrelated intangibles amortization warrant expense and employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased 210 or 2436 million from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in gross profit offset in part by the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution operating income margin declined 15 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to a significant increase in lower margin business with wba and some of our other larger customers

interest expense net increased 40 or 30 million from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 2613 million in fixed rate average borrowings due to the may 2014 issuance of our 600 million 115 senior notes and our 500 million 340 senior notes offset in part by the repayment of our 500 million 5875 senior notes in june 2014 in addition variable rate average borrowings increased 881 million to fund seasonal working capital needs and the onboarding of the wba business 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded a 330 million loss resulting from the early retirement of our 500 million 5875 senior notes due september 2015 

income tax expense was in 3894 million in fiscal 2014 compared to 3310 million in fiscal 2013 

income from continuing operations of 2840 million decreased 424 from the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 121 decreased 424 from 210 in the prior fiscal year the decreases were primarily due to the increases in warrant and lifo expenses and the loss on the early retirement of debt 

loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes for fiscal 2014 and 2013 includes the operating results of andersonbrecon ab and amerisourcebergen canada corporation abcc the loss in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 includes a goodwill impairment charge and the loss on the sale of abcc this loss is net of a gain on the sale of ab 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 2014 and 2013 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 2014 and 2013 was 81 million 266 million and 201 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2015 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 83 million 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2015 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 209 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas and government investigations including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 80 and 84 of our inventories at september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 14 billion and 8818 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 5428 million 3481 million and 2770 million in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 respectively the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict 

equity investments 

we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in entities in which we have significant influence generally this represents an ownership interest of between 20 and 50 unrealized losses that are determined to be otherthantemporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made we recorded an impairment charge of 306 million in fiscal 2015 related to our minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil the impairment charge was based on our determination that the decline in the pharmaceutical wholesalers stock price from the date on which the investment was made to september 30 2015 was otherthantemporary there were no impairment charges on equity investments in fiscal 2014 or 2013 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company including the fair value of any contingent consideration is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the current year we may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 

the first step in the quantitative process for the goodwill impairment test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill we would be required to record any such impairment losses 

we identify our reporting units at the operating segment level generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides 

we utilize a combination of income and marketbased approaches to value the reporting units the income approach to valuation relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 and determined that there were no impairments 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option expected volatility riskfree interest rate dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility the fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of our common stock and the compensation expense associated with the nonvested performance stock units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 

warrants 

we account for the warrants issued to subsidiaries of wba in accordance with the guidance for equitybased payments to nonemployees the various agreements and arrangements with wba established various performance commitments that they must satisfy during the vesting periods of the warrants and if not fulfilled we have the right to cancel the warrants using a binomial lattice model approach the fair value of the warrants was initially measured at the date of issuance and is being expensed over the three and four year vesting periods as an operating expense the fair value of the warrants is remeasured at the end of each quarterly reporting period and an adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations to record the impact as if the newly measured fair value of the awards had been used in recognizing expense starting when the awards were originally issued and through the remeasurement date in total the warrants were valued at 19179 million as of september 30 2015 the valuation of the warrants considers our common stock price and various assumptions such as the volatility of our common stock the expected remaining life of the warrants the expected dividend yield and the riskfree interest rate as a result future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on losses from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 27 million in fiscal 2015 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2015 including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility the revolving credit note and the overdraft facility in thousands 



along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility our receivables securitization facility our revolving credit note and our overdraft facility provide us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements and other strategic initiatives we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that depending on our cash balance can require the use of our credit facilities to fund shortterm capital needs our cash balances in the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 needed to be supplemented by intraperiod credit facility borrowings to cover shortterm working capital needs which were higher in the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 due to the onboarding of the wba business the greatest amount of intraperiod borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that were outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 was 159 million and 11 billion respectively the 1111 million and 176 billion of cumulative intraperiod borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 respectively were fully repaid by the end of each fiscal year

we have a 950 million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility which was scheduled to expire in december 2017 in november 2015 we extended the maturity date to november 2018 we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee we pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates annually to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility which we are compliant with as of september 30 2015 

in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a whollyowned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 

we have an uncommitted unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note revolving credit note the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request shortterm unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed 75 million the revolving credit note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice we also has an uncommitted uk overdraft facility overdraft facility which allows us to borrow up to £20 million to fund short term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our mwi business the overdraft facility expires in november 2016

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends repurchases of shares of our common stock and our hedging strategy see below for further details 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the repayment of debt fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

in august 2013 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million in shares of our common stock subject to market conditions during the fiscal years ended september 30 2015 and 2014 we purchased 3008 million and 1747 million respectively of our common stock under this share repurchase program as of september 30 2015 we had 2745 million of availability remaining on the 750 million repurchase program we currently expect to reduce purchases of our common stock in fiscal 2016 

if subsidiaries of wba exercise their right to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock we have taken steps to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that the exercise of the warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time 

in june 2013 we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer capped call transactions capped calls the capped calls give us the right to shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices at maturity should the warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and were initially intended to cover approximately 60 of the shares subject to the warrants at the time we entered into the transactions if the warrants are exercised we will use a majority of the proceeds to repurchase our shares under the capped calls if our share price exceeds the cap price in the capped calls at the time the warrants are exercised the number of shares that will be delivered to us under the capped calls will be reduced and accordingly will cover less than 60 of the shares of common stock subject to the warrants in addition if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than our breakeven share price then our purchase of the capped calls will have been an ineffective use of capital we completed this hedge transaction in january 2014 in total under this hedge transaction we purchased capped calls on 272 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of 3687 million 

based upon our recent share price the number of shares of common stock we expect to receive under the capped calls at maturity has been reduced therefore we amended certain of the capped calls to increase their cap price to continue to address the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants we paid a premium of 1000 million in january 2015 to increase the cap price on certain of the capped calls subject to the warrants that become exercisable in 2016 

in may 2014 our board of directors approved a special share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to 650 million in shares of our common stock subject to market conditions to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants and supplements our previously executed warrant hedging strategy during the fiscal year ended september 30 2015 we purchased 3980 million under this program which excluded 180 million of fiscal 2014 purchases that cash settled in october 2014 to complete our authorization under this program 

in march 2015 we supplemented our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer call options call options the call options give us the right to buy shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices between april 2015 and october 2015 in total we purchased call options on six million shares of our common stock for a total premium of 800 million in fiscal 2015 we exercised 45 million of the call options for 4275 million which reduced the availability under our special share repurchase programs 

in april 2015 our board of directors approved a new special share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to 10 billion in shares of our common stock subject to market conditions in fiscal 2015 we purchased 10 billion of our common stock under this program to complete our authorization under this program in september 2015 our board of directors approved a new special share repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to 24 billion in shares of our common stock subject to market conditions to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants as part of our warrant hedging strategy in fiscal 2015 we purchased 1241 million of our common stock under this program as of september 30 2015 we had 22759 million of availability remaining on this program availability under our new special share repurchase program is reduced by share repurchases if any of our common stock on the open market under the special program as well as share repurchases related to the companys exercise of call options andor capped calls 

based on the closing price of our common stock on september 30 2015 the capped calls associated with the warrants exercisable in 2016 would have covered approximately 56 of the shares subject to the warrants and the capped calls associated with the warrants exercisable in 2017 would have covered approximately 50 of the shares subject to the warrants adding the shares repurchased through september 30 2015 under the special share repurchase programs we would have covered 100 of the warrants exercisable in 2016 and approximately 89 of the warrants exercisable in 2017 for every five dollar increase in the price of our common stock the coverage provided by the capped calls on each warrant will decrease by approximately two percent and for every five dollar decrease in the price of our common stock the coverage provided by the capped calls on each warrant will increase by approximately two percent 

to the extent the capped calls share repurchases and call options do not fully mitigate the dilutive effect of the warrants we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock and other measures which may include additional amendments to the capped calls or the purchase of additional call options the amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction considering factors such as our financial performance the current and future share price of our common stock our expected cash flows competing priorities for capital and overall market conditions 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2015 in thousands 



we have outsourced to ibm global services ibm a significant portion of our corporate and abdc information technology activities the remaining commitment under our arrangement as amended in june 2015 which expires in june 2018 is approximately 776 million as of september 30 2015 of which 389 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2016 and is included in other commitments in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 528 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2015 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 

during fiscal 2015 our operating activities provided 39204 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 14632 million in the prior fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal 2015 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 51259 million and noncash items of 12861 million offset in part by the loss from continuing operations of 1349 million an increase in accounts receivable of 14788 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of 8364 million the noncash items were comprised primarily of 9127 million of warrant expense the increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers accounts receivable increased from september 30 2014 reflecting our increased revenue volume including additional sales to wba we also increased our merchandise inventories at september 30 2015 to support the increase in business volume 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

we use days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance the below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends 



the increase in days payable outstanding from fiscal 2014 to fiscal 2015 has benefited from the increase in purchases of generic pharmaceuticals which have longer payment terms than brandname pharmaceuticals 

our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital operating cash uses during fiscal 2015 included 915 million of interest payments and 2996 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

during fiscal 2014 our operating activities provided 14632 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 7881 million in fiscal 2013 cash provided by operations in fiscal 2014 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 2840 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 23176 million and noncash items of 7509 million offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of 9383 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of 9565 million accounts receivable increased from september 30 2013 as the result of increased volume associated with our new wba business we also increased our merchandise inventories at september 30 2014 to support the increased volume due to the new wba business the 23176 million increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 were 2316 million 2645 million and 2025 million respectively significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 included technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our primary enterprise resource planning erp system costs associated with building our new national distribution center and expansion of support facilities significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 included infrastructure and technologyrelated costs to onboard the incremental wba distribution volume costs associated with building our new national distribution center and other technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our primary erp system significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our erp system technologyrelated costs to onboard the incremental wba distribution volume and expansion costs related to one of abdcs facilities 

we currently expect to spend approximately 400 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2016 several of the larger 2016 capital expenditures include building a new distribution center and replacing or upgrading existing distribution centers and information system investments to support a data center consolidation and a new operating system for one of our business units 

in fiscal 2014 we invested 1178 million to acquire a minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil and to form a specialty joint venture with the same entity in may 2013 we divested ab and received 3065 million of cash net of a working capital adjustment and divested abcc and received 235 million of cash 

net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 included 10 billion of borrowings under our term loan and 9964 million of proceeds received related to the february 2015 issuance of our 2025 notes and 2045 notes we used the proceeds from these financing activities to fund a portion of our february 2015 acquisition of mwi a leading animal health distribution company in the united states and in the united kingdom for a price of 19000 per share or 26 billion in total 

in fiscal 2014 we issued our 2017 notes and our 2024 notes for total proceeds of 11 billion these proceeds were used to finance the early retirement of the 2015 notes including the payment of premiums and other costs totaling 5315 million 

in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 we paid 19 billion 7539 million and 4842 million respectively for purchases of our common stock in fiscal 2015 2014 and 2013 we paid 1800 million 2114 million and 1573 million respectively to purchase or amend capped calls and call options to hedge the potential dilution associated with the warrants upon their exercise 

our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases 



we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors 

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements in fiscal 2015 we used a 10 billion variable rate term loan to finance a portion of the mwi acquisition price in fiscal 2015 we elected to make early principal payments totaling 500 million on the new term loan we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2015 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 22 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2015 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the euro the uk pound sterling canadian dollar and the brazilian real we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes as of september 30 2015 we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of a c500 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of a canadian business in may 2013 

changes in the price and volatility of our common stock may have a significant impact on the fair value of the warrants issued to subsidiaries of wba see note 8 as of september 30 2015 a one dollar change in our common stock holding other assumptions constant would increase or decrease the fair value of the warrants by approximately 44 million and a one percent change in volatility holding other assumptions constant would have approximately 1 million of an impact on the fair value of the warrants

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc ims an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow approximately 64 annually from 2014 through 2018 primarily due to strong demand favorable pricing and new product introductions ims expects that generic pharmaceutical sales will grow faster than the overall market 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

  aging population the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 50 million by 2018 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

  increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 85 of the prescription volume in the united states 

  increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 12 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

  legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates more recently in march 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which would increase the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details

operations 

  operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2014 are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 

  pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals vaccines and other specialty products additionally absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products have historically been a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the world courier operating segment the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry 

  sales and marketing the majority of abdcs sales force is led nationally with regional focus and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdcs marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdcs sales teams and marketing organization also serve national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our other operating segments each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings in addition we have a corporate marketing group that coordinates branding and other marketing activities across the company 

  customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physicians and physician group practices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers 

our two largest customers walgreen co walgreens and express scripts inc accounted for 28 and 18 respectively of our fiscal 2014 revenue our top 10 customers including governmental agencies represented approximately 58 of fiscal 2014 revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 8 of our revenue in fiscal 2014 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

  suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2014 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2014 accounted for approximately 49 of our purchases 

  information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized enterprise resource planning erp system abdcs erp system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdcs systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing third party claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc has a warehouse operating system which is used to manage the majority of abdcs transactional volume the warehouse operating system has improved abdcs productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services and other third party service providers 

we expect to continue to enhance and upgrade the erp system in addition in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements see risk factor — increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  we expect to continue to make significant investments in our information systems 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized erp system resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities 

competition 

we face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest competitors are mckesson corporation mckesson and cardinal health inc cardinal abdc competes with both mckesson and cardinal as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absgs operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc and ups logistics among others our abcs and world courier businesses also face competition from a variety of competitors in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2014 we had approximately 14000 employees of which approximately 13000 were fulltime employees approximately 2 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level congress has enacted legislation to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system by establishing federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level these and other requirements are expected to increase the cost of our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid in addition among other things the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system 

any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and privacy practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its accompanying federal regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of individually identifiable health information as such term is defined under the hipaa regulations some of our businesses collect maintain andor access individually identifiable health information and are subject to the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

enacted in 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect individually identifiable health information a section of the arra known as the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act strengthened certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to these additional obligations under the hipaa final rules 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa the hitech act and the regulations implemented thereunder security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate which regulations continue to evolve 

there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals mckesson and cardinal regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals national generic distributors chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and repackaging and healthcare technology companies see competition on page 5 if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

  our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded and generic pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases if the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the countries where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

the capital and credit markets could experience significant volatility and disruption if the markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

  our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2014 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 42 and 13 of accounts receivable net 

  our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

walgreens co walgreens accounted for 28 of our revenue in fiscal 2014 express scripts accounted for 18 of our revenue in fiscal 2014 our top ten customers including governmental agencies represented approximately 58 of fiscal 2014 revenue we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 8 of our revenue in fiscal 2014 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

  if walgreens andor alliance boots gmbh alliance boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in connection with our strategic relationship with walgreens and alliance boots we entered into a framework agreement with walgreens and alliance boots dated as of march 18 2013 the framework agreement pursuant to which i walgreens and alliance boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen beginning with the right but not the obligation to purchase up to 19859795 shares of our common stock approximately 7 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming the exercise in full of the warrants described below in open market transactions with the right to designate up to two members of our board of directors upon achieving specified ownership levels ii walgreens pharmacy strategies llc a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 and iii alliance boots luxembourg sàrl a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance boots was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 collectively the warrants the warrants collectively represent approximately 16 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming exercise in full of the warrants the number of shares which may be purchased in the open market is subject to increase in certain circumstances if the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of the first tranche of warrants when those warrants are exercisable in 2016 in such event the incremental number of shares purchased in the open market would reduce shareforshare the number of shares exercisable pursuant to the first tranche of warrants 

future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders in addition the dilutive effect of the warrants will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share during the period that the warrants are outstanding a decrease in our diluted earnings per share could in turn adversely affect the market value of our common stock in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock acquired pursuant to open market purchases by walgreens and alliance boots or issuable upon the exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

  a disruption in our relationship with walgreens could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in march 2013 we entered into a tenyear distribution agreement with walgreens to act as its primary wholesale distribution source with respect to branded and generic prescription drugs beginning september 1 2013 we became the supplier of walgreens branded prescription drugs in fiscal year 2014 we began to distribute to walgreens generic pharmaceutical products as of september 30 2014 we are walgreens primary distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals if walgreens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit walgreens for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or walgreens will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that walgreens experiences including any disruptions of certain of walgreens existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies 

  the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with walgreens may not be realized 

we entered into the arrangement with walgreens and alliance boots with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming many of the anticipated benefits and expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits resulting from participation in walgreens boots alliance development gmbh a global sourcing joint venture between walgreens and alliance boots due to the inability of the joint venture to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of this strategic arrangement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility the potential changes in supplier and customer relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship and whether the unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner 

in addition walgreens and alliance boots have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements to invest in our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework and shareholder agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock 

  increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry in the united states is highly regulated at the federal and state levels there have been increasing efforts by congress and state and federal agencies including state boards of pharmacy and departments of health and the fda to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system pedigree tracking consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006 the fda regulations impose pedigree tracking and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni in march 2010 fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain in november 2013 congress passed the drug quality and security act dqsa the dqsa establishes federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level preempts state drug pedigree requirements and will eventually require all supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug track and trace system 

complying with these pedigree tracking and other supply chain custody requirements will increase our costs and could otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

  the suspension or revocation by the united states drug enforcement administration dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by the dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances we have received and may in the future receive requests for information and subpoenas from the dea various united states attorneys offices of the united states department of justice andor state regulatory agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances or our order monitoring program which is designed to prevent or detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances we generally respond to such subpoenas and requests in a thorough and timely manner these responses sometimes require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the company such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil criminal or regulatory legal proceedings against the company as well as to settlements which can be material 

the dea fda and other federal and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

  legal regulatory and legislative changes may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined additionally on occasion price increases on certain branded and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of us congressional inquiries any regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing could adversely affect our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage including coverage for at least a portion of drug costs through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations 

the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price amp the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms has released for review and comment a draft federal upper limit methodology and draft federal upper limits determined by using that methodology while the draft federal upper limit prices released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits currently in place the impact of the cms methodology cannot be determined until finalized any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and make other changes affecting medicaid rebate amounts the affordable care acts redefinition of amp is expected to result in most instances in a higher amp this higher amp coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business cms issued proposed regulations to implement the affordable care acts provisions regarding medicaid rebates and medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies but the regulations have not been finalized to date we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts for example a number of states have announced plans to use average acquisition cost to reimburse pharmacies for the cost of drugs there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

cms has been conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average actual pharmacy acquisition costs the results of which states may use to determine statespecific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates cms uses pharmacies invoiced drug acquisition costs as reported in the surveys to calculate the national average drug acquisition cost nadac cms has begun posting final nadac files which are updated on a weekly and monthly basis to reflect survey results there can be no assurances that state pharmaceutical rates derived from this new survey data will not result in lower medicaid reimbursement levels or lead to other payers reducing their reimbursement levels that could adversely impact our business 

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional changes to the part d program since its enactment notably the affordable care act provides additional assistance to beneficiaries who reach the part d coverage gap including a manufacturer discount program mandates additional medication therapy management services and reduces part d subsidies for certain highincome beneficiaries cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration went into effect as a result of congressional failure to adopt legislation meeting federal deficit reduction targets under this policy a 2 cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  absgs business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physicians office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other 

economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some of our customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg this trend may continue due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms calculates average sales price for medicare part b drugs as well as expansion and regulation of the public health services 340b drug discount program federal changes in drug reimbursement policy could continue to reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs which could accelerate the trend of physician practices moving to or being acquired by hospitals and could also indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in corresponding declines in absgs profitability any future reductions in the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

  if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of branded andor generic pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws 

and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

the company has learned that there are filings in one or more federal district courts including a qui tam complaint filed by one of our former employees that are under seal and may involve allegations against the company andor subsidiaries or businesses of the company including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business relating to its distribution of certain pharmaceutical products to providers with regard to any of these filings our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if government authorities decide to intervene in any such pending cases andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such pending cases 

  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to execute our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the united states are subject to various risks inherent in global operations we currently have operations in over 50 countries worldwide we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local political changes and local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition the realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 

we are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care we deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including hospitals and dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals vaccines and other specialty products additionally absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products have historically been a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the world courier group inc world courier operating segment the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry 

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2014 compared with year ended september 30 2013 

revenue 



revenue increased 359 from the prior fiscal year this increase was largely due to the revenue growth of pharmaceutical distribution and to a lesser extent the revenue growth of other 

we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2015 to increase between 7 and 8 our expected growth rate is driven in part by a full year of generic drug distribution to walgreens which was phased in during fiscal 2014 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the introduction of new innovative brand therapies the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by 364 from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution revenue these revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdcs facilities total intrasegment revenues were 42 billion and 34 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively 

abdcs revenue of 1019 billion increased 420 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in abdcs revenue was primarily due to increased sales to walgreens of 250 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 and increased sales including new hepatitis c drugs to some of our other larger customers 

absgs revenue of 196 billion increased 111 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations primarily due to increased sales of certain specialty products and growth in its blood products vaccine and specialty distribution businesses the specialty distribution business continues to benefit from sales of an ophthalmology drug 

a portion of absgs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology under federal sequestration legislation medicare physician reimbursement rates for part b drugs were reduced on april 1 2013 community oncologists and other specialty physicians that administer drugs under medicare part b continue to be impacted by lower reimbursement rates for specialty pharmaceutical drugs as a result some physician practices continue to consider consolidating or selling their businesses to hospitals while we service the needs of many hospitals the continuing shift in this service channel has reduced oncology revenue refer to item 1a risk factors in this report for a more detailed description of this business risk absgs business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals especially oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in additional revenue reductions 

a number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations gpos are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 no significant contracts expired over the next twelve months only one significant contract is scheduled to expire our contract with express scripts inc express scripts expires in september 2015 however it is subject to an automatic one year renewal at the election of express scripts express scripts accounted for 18 of our revenue in fiscal 2014 our revenue results or operations and cash flows will be negatively impacted if the express scripts contract is not renewed or the terms of the renewed contract are less favorable than the existing contract 

other 

revenue in other increased 173 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to our distribution business within abcs which benefited from the launch of two new products in the middle of the prior fiscal year increased revenue from world courier also contributed to the fiscal 2014 revenue growth 

gross profit 



gross profit increased 189 or 4745 million from the prior fiscal year 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased 219 or 4984 million from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the higher brand and generic sales volume to walgreens brand and generic price appreciation and the growth of our noncommunity oncology specialty distribution businesses gross profit in fiscal 2014 also benefited from income resulting from our participation in the walgreens and alliance boots procurement joint venture as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 236 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 decreased 28 basis points from the prior fiscal year the pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin decline was primarily due to a significant increase in lower margin business with walgreens and some of our other larger customers and competitive pressures on customer margins 

gross profit in other increased 93 or 457 million from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to improved gross margin in world courier and higher revenue in abcs distribution business as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 2184 decreased from 2343 in the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to an increase in abcs distribution revenue which has a lower gross profit margin in comparison to other businesses within other these decreases were offset in part by increases in the gross profit margin of world courier 

we recognized gains of 244 million and 229 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively the gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold we are unable to estimate future gains if any that we will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation settlements see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict we recorded lifo expense of 3481 million and 2770 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expense increased 190 or 2535 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the onboarding of our distribution agreement with walgreens more specifically expenses related to payroll information technology and delivery were higher in the current fiscal year 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of capital projects being depreciated amortization expense was comparable to the prior fiscal year 

warrant expense was 4227 million and 901 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively the warrants were issued in march 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with walgreens and alliance boots future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly refer to the critical accounting policies and estimates — warrants on page 33 for a more detailed description of the accounting for the warrants 

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 included 63 million of dealrelated transaction costs and 19 million of employee severance and other costs employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 included 230 million of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the walgreens and alliance boots transaction and 05 million of employee severance and facility closure costs 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 184 in fiscal 2014 up 1 basis point from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the larger warrant expense in the current fiscal year offset in part by economies of scale as a result of the increased revenue provided by the walgreens distribution agreement 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements lifo expense acquisition related intangibles amortization warrant expense and employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased 210 or 2436 million from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in gross profit offset in part by the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution operating income margin declined 15 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to a significant increase in lower margin business with walgreens and some of our other larger customers 

operating income in other increased 176 or 225 million primarily due to the increase in gross profit of world courier 

interest expense interest income and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense net increased 40 or 30 million from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 2613 million in fixed rate average borrowings due to the may 2014 issuance of our 600 million 115 senior notes and our 500 million 340 senior notes offset in part by the repayment of our 500 million 5875 senior notes in june 2014 in addition variable rate average borrowings increased 881 million to fund seasonal working capital needs and the onboarding of the walgreens business 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

during fiscal 2014 we recorded a 330 million loss resulting from the early retirement of our 500 million 5875 senior notes due september 2015 see liquidity and capital resources 

a significant portion of warrant expense is not tax deductible as a result income taxes in fiscal 2014 reflect an effective tax rate of 578 compared to 402 in the prior fiscal year the fluctuation in our effective tax rate was the result of changes in the valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes 

income from continuing operations of 2840 million decreased 424 from the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 121 decreased 424 from 210 in the prior fiscal year these declines were primarily due to the increases in warrant and lifo expenses and the loss on the early retirement of debt 

loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes for all periods presented includes the operating results of andersonbrecon ab and amerisourcebergen canada corporation abcc the loss in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 includes a goodwill impairment charge and the loss on the sale of abcc this loss is net of a gain on the sale of ab 

year ended september 30 2013 compared with year ended september 30 2012 

revenue 



revenue of 880 billion in fiscal 2013 increased 127 from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to the revenue growth of both pharmaceutical distribution and other 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by 122 from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution 

revenue these revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdcs facilities total intrasegment revenues were 34 billion and 26 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively 

abdcs revenue of 718 billion increased 141 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in abdcs revenue was primarily due to increased sales to express scripts of 75 billion and walgreens of 29 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 the increased sales were offset in part by the loss of a food and drug retail group purchasing organization gpo customer which resulted in a 17 billion decrease in revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 additionally revenue was favorably impacted by an increase in brandname pharmaceutical prices and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the use of lower priced generic pharmaceuticals the increased use of generic pharmaceuticals was the result of over 30 brand to generic conversions in fiscal 2012 

absgs revenue of 176 billion in fiscal 2013 increased 76 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations primarily due to the growth in its blood products vaccine and physician office distribution businesses and its third party logistics business the physician office distribution business benefitted from increased sales of an ophthalmology drug in fiscal 2013 absgs revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales to community oncology practices 

other 

revenue in other increased 5122 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 2711 million incremental revenue contributions from world courier which was acquired in april 2012 

gross profit 



gross profit decreased 48 or approximately 1269 million from the prior fiscal year 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit decreased 22 or approximately 504 million from the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the lower gross profit related to the express scripts contract the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer the lower number of generic launches and the reduced contribution from sales of certain specialty oncology drugs this decrease was offset in part by stronger price appreciation related to generic drugs and the growth of our nononcology specialty distribution businesses as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 264 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 39 basis points from the prior fiscal year the pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin decline in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 was primarily due to lower gross profit margin related to the current express scripts contract the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer and competitive pressures on customer margins 

gross profit in other increased by 1918 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the 1613 million incremental contributions made by our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier as a percentage of revenue gross profit margin in other of 2343 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 increased from 1887 in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the gross profit contributions from our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier 

in fiscal 2013 we recognized a gain of 229 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in comparison to a gain of 148 million in the prior fiscal year these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences due to the additional branded inventory that we were required to purchase to service the walgreens contract approximately 13 billion and the impact the branded inventory had on our annual inflation index as well as higher brand drug price inflation and lower generic drug price deflation we recorded a lifo charge of 2770 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2013 increased 157 or approximately 1812 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the incremental operating costs of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier and additional costs to support the onboarding of our distribution agreement with walgreens 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier and due to an increase in capital projects amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier 

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 included 230 million of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the walgreens and alliance boots transaction and 05 million of employee severance and facility closure costs 

in fiscal 2012 we introduced a number of initiatives some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions in connection with these initiatives we recorded 330 million of employee severance and other related costs other costs included an estimated 103 million liability to exit our participation in a multiemployer pension plan resulting from a abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal 2013 in addition we incurred 111 million of dealrelated transaction costs in connection with business combinations 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 183 in fiscal 2013 an increase of 13 basis points from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the warrant expense and the addition of our fiscal 2012 world courier acquisition which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for the pharmaceutical distribution segment as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were down 10 basis points from the prior fiscal year 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before gains on antitrust litigation settlements lifo expense acquisition related intangibles amortization warrant expense and employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income decreased 73 or 920 million from the prior fiscal year as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution operating income margin was 135 and 164 in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the 29 basis point decline in pharmaceutical distribution operating margin from the prior fiscal year was due to decreased contributions from generic launches a shift in customer mix towards lower margin business in abdc most notably the express scripts contract the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer and a decline in the operating margin of our oncology business 

operating income in other increased 304 million from the prior fiscal year due to the incremental contribution made by our fiscal 2012 world courier acquisition and an increase in operating income from our abcs businesses 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2013 and 2012 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense decreased from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease of 3238 million in average borrowings primarily due to the repayment of our 392 million 5625 senior notes in september 2012 offset in part by the issuance of our 500 million 350 senior notes in november 2011 

income taxes in fiscal 2013 reflect an effective tax rate of 402 compared to 374 in the prior fiscal year our effective tax rate was higher in fiscal 2013 because a portion of the warrant expense is not tax deductible 

income from continuing operations of 4934 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 352 from the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 210 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 291 from 296 in the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge and warrant expense the percentage difference between the change in diluted earnings per share and the change in income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 was due to the 84 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes for all periods presented includes the operating results of andersonbrecon ab and amerisourcebergen canada corporation abcc the loss in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 includes a goodwill impairment charge and the loss on the sale of abcc this loss is net of a gain on the sale of ab 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve for customer sales returns 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit we record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends 

in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 2013 and 2012 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 2013 and 2012 was 266 million 201 million and 231 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2014 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 64 million 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2014 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 156 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas and government investigations including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 84 and 83 of our inventories at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 8818 million and 5337 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 3481 million 2770 million and 07 million in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 respectively the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict 

equity investments 

we use the equity method of accounting for our investments in entities in which we have significant influence generally this represents an ownership interest of between 20 and 50 unrealized losses that are determined to be otherthantemporary impairment losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company including the fair value of any contingent consideration is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the current year we may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 

the first step in the quantitative process for the goodwill impairment test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill we would be required to record any such impairment losses 

we identify our reporting units at the operating segment level generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides 

we utilize a combination of income and marketbased approaches to valuation for its reporting units the income approach to valuation relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 and determined that there were no impairments 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option expected volatility riskfree interest rate dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility the fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of our common stock and the compensation expense associated with the nonvested performance stock units is dependent on our periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and our estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued 

warrants 

we account for the warrants issued to walgreens and alliance boots in accordance with the guidance for equitybased payments to nonemployees the various agreements and arrangements with walgreens and alliance boots established various performance commitments that they must satisfy during the vesting periods of the warrants and if not fulfilled we have the right to cancel the warrants using a binomial lattice model approach the fair value of the warrants was initially measured at the date of issuance and is being expensed over the three and four year vesting periods as an operating expense the fair value of the warrants is remeasured at the end of each quarterly reporting period and an adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations to record the impact as if the newly measured fair value of the awards had been used in recognizing expense starting when the awards were originally issued and through the remeasurement date in total the warrants were valued at 11398 million as of september 30 2014 the valuation of the warrants considers our common stock price and various assumptions such as the volatility of our common stock the expected remaining life of the warrants the expected dividend yield and the riskfree interest rate as a result future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly 

a portion of the warrant expense is not tax deductible therefore our future effective income tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending on the valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 67 million in fiscal 2014 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2014 including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note in thousands 



along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility our receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements we have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the december and march quarters that depending on our cash balance can require the use of our credit facilities to fund shortterm capital needs our cash balances in the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 needed to be supplemented by intraperiod credit facility borrowings to cover shortterm working capital needs which were higher in the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 due to the onboarding of the walgreens business the greatest amount of variablerate debt outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 was 11 billion and 5950 million respectively the 176 billion and 23 billion of cumulative intraperiod borrowings during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 respectively were fully repaid by the end of each fiscal year 

we have a 14 billion multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in august 2019 the multicurrency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 69 basis points to 110 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable 90 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee at september 30 2014 additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points annually of the total commitment 10 basis points at september 30 2014 we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test as well as others that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales with which we are compliant as of september 30 2014 

we have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue shortterm promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to 14 billion at any one time amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed from time to time the maturities on the notes will vary but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance the notes will bear interest rates if interest bearing or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multicurrency revolving credit facility there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at september 30 2014 

we have a 950 million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility which expires in june 2016 we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee of 75 basis points we pay an unused fee of 40 basis points annually to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility which we are compliant with as of september 30 2014 

in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 

we have an uncommitted unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note revolving credit note the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request shortterm unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed 75 million the revolving credit note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice 

in may 2014 we issued 600 million of 115 senior notes due may 15 2017 the 2017 notes and 500 million of 340 senior notes due may 15 2024 the 2024 notes the 2017 notes were sold at 99892 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 1187 the 2024 notes were sold at 99715 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 3434 interest on the 2017 notes and 2024 notes is payable semiannually in arrears commencing on november 15 2014 the 2017 notes and 2024 notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility the revolving credit note the 400 million 4875 senior notes due in 2019 and the 500 million 350 senior notes due in 2021 costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2017 notes and 2024 notes were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the notes 

we used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2017 and 2024 notes to finance the early retirement of the 500 million 5875 senior notes due september 15 2015 including the payment of 315 million of premiums and other costs we used the remaining amount for general corporate purposes including repurchases of shares of our common stock under our special share repurchase program approved in may 2014 

we have 400 million of 4875 senior notes due november 15 2019 the 2019 notes and 500 million of 350 senior notes due november 15 2021 the 2021 notes the 2019 notes were sold in november 2009 at 99174 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 498 the 2021 notes were sold in november 2011 at 99858 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 352 interest on the 2019 notes and the 2021 notes is payable semiannually in arrears 

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the repayment of debt fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities in november 2012 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million shares of our common stock subject to market conditions during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 we purchased 3630 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this 750 million share repurchase program in august 2013 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 we purchased 1747 million of our common stock under this share repurchase program which included 180 million of purchases that cash settled after september 30 2014 as of september 30 2014 we had 5753 million of availability remaining on the 750 million repurchase program excluding purchases under the 650 million special share repurchase program see below for further details we currently expect to purchase 400 million of our common stock in fiscal 2015 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

if walgreens andor alliance boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock we have taken steps to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time 

in june 2013 we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it has executed a series of issuer capped call transactions capped calls the capped calls give us the right to shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices at maturity should the warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and were intended to cover approximately 60 of the shares subject to the warrants at the time we entered into the transactions if our share price exceeds the cap price in the capped calls at the time the warrants are exercised the number of shares that will be delivered to us under the capped calls will be reduced and accordingly will cover less than 60 of the shares of common stock subject to the warrants in addition if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than our breakeven share price then our purchase of the capped calls will have been an ineffective use of capital we completed this hedge transaction in january 2014 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 we purchased capped calls on 119 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of 2114 million which included a 61 million payment for a hedge premium accrued at september 30 2013 in total under this hedge transaction we purchased capped calls on 272 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of 3687 million 

based upon our recent share price the number of shares of common stock we expect to receive under the capped calls at maturity has been reduced and we have amended certain of the capped calls to increase the cap price to continue to address the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants to the extent the capped calls and share repurchases do not fully mitigate the dilutive effect of the warrants we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock and other measures which may include additional amendments to the capped calls the amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction considering factors such as our financial performance the current and future share price of our common stock our expected cash flows competing priorities for capital and overall market conditions 

in may 2014 our board of directors approved a special share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to 650 million shares of our common stock subject to market conditions as an opportunity to further mitigate the potentially dilutive effect of the warrants and supplements our previously executed warrant hedging strategy during the fiscal year ended september 30 2014 we purchased 2520 million under this program which included 180 million of purchases that cash settled after september 30 2014 as of september 30 2014 we had 3980 million of availability remaining on the special 650 million repurchase program we currently expect to make special share repurchases totaling approximately 400 million of our common stock in fiscal 2015 subject to market conditions 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2014 in thousands 



we have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 20152016 flu season we are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately 729 million as of september 30 2014 of which 572 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2015 these influenza vaccine commitments are included in other commitments in the above table 

we have outsourced to ibm global services ibm a significant portion of our corporate and abdc information technology activities the remaining commitment under our arrangement as amended in may 2014 which expires in june 2018 is approximately 741 million as of september 30 2014 of which 371 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2015 and is included in other commitments in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 506 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2014 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 

during fiscal 2014 our operating activities provided 14632 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 7881 million in the prior fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal 2014 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 2840 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 23176 million and noncash items of 7509 million offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of 9383 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of 9565 million accounts receivable increased from september 30 2013 as the result of increased volume associated with our new walgreens business we also increased our merchandise inventories at september 30 2014 to support the increased volume due to the new walgreens business the 23176 million increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in merchandise inventories and the timing of payments to our suppliers 

we use days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance the increase in days sales outstanding from the prior fiscal year reflects the increased sales volume and payment terms under the walgreens distribution contract the increase in days payable outstanding from the prior fiscal year is the result of increased purchases of generic pharmaceuticals which have longer payment terms than brandname pharmaceuticals 



our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital operating cash uses during fiscal 2014 included 629 million of interest payments and 1970 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

during fiscal 2013 our operating activities provided 7881 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 13054 million in fiscal 2012 cash provided by operations in fiscal 2013 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 4934 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 38183 million and noncash items of 3465 million offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of 23125 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of 14866 million the increase in accounts receivable was the result of increased volume associated with our largest pharmacy benefit management pbm customer contract which became effective october 1 2012 and walgreens contract which became effective september 1 2013 additionally while the payment terms in the pbm customer contract are favorable they are longer than the payment terms in the previous contract as a result there was a negative impact on our working capital in fiscal 2013 we also increased our merchandise inventories at september 30 2013 to support the increased volume due to the pbm customer and walgreens contracts the 38183 million increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in business volume and the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 were 2645 million 2025 million and 1333 million respectively significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 included infrastructure and technologyrelated costs to onboard the incremental walgreens distribution volume costs associated with building our new national distribution center and other technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our enterprise resource planning erp system significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our erp system technologyrelated costs to onboard the incremental walgreens distribution volume and expansion costs related to one of abdcs facilities our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 related to our new erp system and investments made in our abdc and abcs facilities other capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 included abdc purchases of machinery and equipment which were previously sold to financial institutions and leased back by us and other technology initiatives 

we currently expect to spend approximately 300 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2015 several of the larger 2015 capital expenditures include increasing distribution center capacity and automation improvements the implementation of trackandtrace authentication technology and information system investments to support increased order volume and future growth 

in june 2014 we invested 1178 million to acquire a minority ownership interest in a pharmaceutical wholesaler in brazil and to form a specialty joint venture with the same entity in may 2013 we divested ab and received 3065 million of cash net of a working capital adjustment and divested abcc and received 235 million of cash 

in april 2012 we acquired world courier for a purchase price of 5180 million net of a working capital adjustment in november 2011 we acquired theracom for a purchase price of 2572 million net of a working capital adjustment additionally in fiscal 2012 we finalized working capital adjustments relating to our september 2011 acquisitions of intrinsiq llc and premier source totaling 05 million net 

in may 2014 we issued our 2017 notes and our 2024 notes for total proceeds of 11 billion these proceeds were used to finance the early retirement of the 2015 notes including the payment of premiums and other costs totaling 5315 million fiscal 2012 included 4993 million of proceeds received related to the november 2011 issuance of our 2021 notes and the repayments of 3923 million of senior notes due september 15 2012 and 55 million due under a terminated credit facility 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2014 2013 and 2012 included the purchase of 7539 million 4842 million and 11622 million respectively of our common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs 

during the fiscal years ended september 30 2014 and 2013 we paid 2114 million and 1573 million respectively to purchase capped calls to hedge the potential dilution associated with the warrants upon their exercise 

our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases 



we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors 

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2014 we had no variable rate debt outstanding the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2014 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 18 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2014 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar the euro the uk pound sterling and the brazilian real we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes as of september 30 2014 we had one foreign currency denominated contract outstanding that hedges the foreign currency exchange risk of the c500 million note that we received in conjunction with the sale of abcc in may 2013 

changes in the price and volatility of our common stock may have a significant impact on the fair value of the warrants issued to walgreens and alliance boots see note 7 as of september 30 2014 a one dollar change in our common stock holding other assumptions constant would increase or decrease the fair value of the warrants by approximately 42 million and a one percent change in volatility holding other assumptions constant would increase or decrease the fair value of the warrants by approximately 7 million

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc ims an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow approximately 23 annually from 2013 through 2017 ims expects that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

  aging population the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 49 million by 2017 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

  increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 80 of the prescription volume in the united states 

  increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 12 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

  legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates more recently in march 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which would increase the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 5 for further details

operations 

  operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2013 are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the world courier operating segment 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to improve patient access to products and enhance patient care 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and medication and supply dispensing cabinets additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physician practices who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines additionally absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products are a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the abcs operating segment and the world courier operating segment world courier was acquired on april 30 2012 the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry 

  sales and marketing the majority of abdcs sales force is organized regionally and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdcs national marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdcs sales and marketing organization also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our other operating segments each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings in addition we have a corporate marketing group that coordinates branding and other marketing activities across the company 

  customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physicians and physician group practices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers 

express scripts inc our largest customer in fiscal 2013 accounted for 24 of our revenue our top 10 customers including governmental agencies represented approximately 48 of fiscal 2013 revenue in fiscal 2014 walgreens will be our largest customer in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2013 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

  suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2013 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2013 accounted for approximately 47 of our purchases 

  information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized enterprise resource planning erp system abdcs erp system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdcs systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing third party claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc has a warehouse operating system which is used to manage the majority of abdcs transactional volume the warehouse operating system has improved abdcs productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services and other third party service providers 

we expect to continue to enhance and upgrade the erp system including passport our webbased customer facing application in addition in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements see risk factor — increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability  we expect to continue to make significant investments in our information systems 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized erp system resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities 

competition 

we face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest competitors are mckesson corporation mckesson and cardinal health inc cardinal abdc competes with both mckesson and cardinal as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absgs operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc and ups logistics among others our abcs and world courier businesses also face competition from a variety of competitors in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2013 we had approximately 13000 employees of which approximately 12000 were fulltime employees approximately 2 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system at the federal level congress has enacted legislation to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system by establishing federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level these and other requirements are expected to increase the cost of our operations 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of their prescription drug costs the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid in addition among other things the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system 

any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see risk factors below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its accompanying federal regulations set forth privacy and security standards in order to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of individually identifiable health information as such term is defined under the hipaa regulations our operations depending on their location may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

enacted in 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect individually identifiable health information a section of the arra known as the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act strengthened certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards on january 25 2013 the office for civil rights of hhs published the hipaa omnibus final rule hipaa final rule which amended certain aspects of the hipaa privacy security and enforcement rules pursuant to the hitech act extending certain hipaa obligations to business associates and their subcontractors certain components of our business act as business associates within the meaning of hipaa and are subject to new obligations under the hipaa final rules 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa the hitech act and the regulations implemented thereunder security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 

there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements including new hipaa final rule requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals mckesson and cardinal regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals national generic distributors chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies see competition on page 4 competition continues to increase in specialty distribution and services where gross margins historically have been higher than in abdc reflecting that increased competition our two national competitors have continued to expand their footprint in the area of specialty distribution and services if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

  our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded and generic pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result our gross profit from brandname and generic manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases if the frequency or rate of branded and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

express scripts accounted for 24 of our revenue in fiscal 2013 our top ten customers including governmental agencies represented approximately 48 of fiscal 2013 revenue in fiscal 2014 walgreens will be our largest customer we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2013 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

  our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2013 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 32 and 13 of accounts receivable net 

  if walgreen co walgreens andor alliance boots gmbh alliance boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

in connection with our strategic relationship with walgreens and alliance boots we entered into a framework agreement with walgreens and alliance boots dated as of march 18 2013 the framework agreement pursuant to which i walgreens and alliance boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen beginning with the right but not the obligation to purchase up to 19859795 shares of our common stock approximately 7 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming the exercise in full of the warrants described below in open market transactions with the right to designate up to two members of our board of directors upon achieving specified ownership levels ii walgreens pharmacy strategies llc a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 and iii alliance boots luxembourg sàrl a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance boots was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 collectively the warrants the warrants collectively represent approximately 16 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming exercise in full of the warrants the number of shares which may be purchased in the open market is subject to increase in certain circumstances if the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of the first tranche of warrants when those warrants are exercisable in 2016 in such event the incremental number of shares purchased in the open market would reduce shareforshare the number of shares exercisable pursuant to the first tranche of warrants 

future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders in addition the dilutive effect of the warrants will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share during the period that the warrants are outstanding a decrease in our diluted earnings per share could in turn adversely affect the market value of our common stock in addition any sales in the public market of any common stock acquired pursuant to open market purchases by walgreens and alliance boots or issuable upon the exercise of the warrants could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 

  problems with the transition of walgreens business to us our performance under the distribution agreement andor a disruption in our relationship with walgreens could adversely affect our business and financial results 

in march 2013 we entered into a tenyear distribution agreement with walgreens to act as its primary wholesale distribution source with respect to branded and generic prescription drugs this agreement when fully implemented will significantly expand our relationship with walgreens beginning september 1 2013 we became the supplier of walgreens branded prescription drugs beginning in fiscal year 2014 walgreens will over time move the supply of its generic prescription drug business to us in order to transition the business we will utilize unused capacity in our distribution network and will leverage prior investments in our new enterprise resource planning system in the event there are any unanticipated delays costs fees charges expenses capital expenditures or disruption of our business or operations relating to our transition to becoming the single branded and generic prescription drug wholesaler to walgreens could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

in addition our business may be adversely affected by any operational financial or regulatory difficulties that walgreens experiences including any disruptions of certain of walgreens existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the dea andor state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies if walgreens operations are seriously disrupted for any reason whether by natural disaster labor disruption regulatory or governmental action or otherwise it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability 

if our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason we may have an obligation to pay or credit walgreens for failure to supply products in addition upon the expiration or termination of the agreement there can be no assurance that we or walgreens will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement on terms favorable to us or at all 

  the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with walgreens may not be realized 

we entered into the arrangement with walgreens and alliance boots with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including among other things growth in our revenues earnings and earnings per share cost savings and operating efficiencies innovation and sharing of best practices we currently anticipate earnings accretion from the agreement for fiscal year 2014 excluding any expenses related to the warrants certain nonrecurring costs and certain startup expenses this expectation is based on our preliminary estimates which may materially change the processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex costly and timeconsuming many of the anticipated benefits and expenses that will be incurred by their nature are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations processes or initiatives or the inability to realize andor delays in realizing potential benefits including improved generic drug pricing and terms improved service fees from generic manufacturers cost savings innovations or other benefits resulting from participation in walgreens boots alliance development gmbh a global sourcing joint venture between walgreens and alliance boots due to the inability of the joint venture to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected the transition of walgreens generic prescription drug distribution to us the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of this strategic arrangement including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational strategic or financial flexibility the potential disruption resulting from supplier and customer reaction to the strategic transaction and potential changes in supplier and 

customer relationships and terms unexpected or unforeseen costs fees expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship and whether the unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner 

in addition walgreens and alliance boots have the right but not the obligation under the transactions contemplated by the framework and shareholder agreements to invest in our common stock we could also encounter unforeseen costs circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the framework and shareholder agreements many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs decreased revenue decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention if we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame or at all the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations and the price of our common stock 

  our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006 the fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni in march 2010 fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain in november 2013 congress passed the drug quality and security act dqsa the dqsa is expected to establish federal pedigree tracking standards requiring drugs to be labelled and tracked at the lot level preempt state drug pedigree requirements and require supplychain stakeholders to participate in an electronic interoperable prescription drug track and trace system 

the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements will increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

  the suspension or revocation by the united states drug enforcement administration dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by the dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various other federal and state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substances act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances government authorities may from time to time investigate whether we are in compliance with various security and operating standards applicable to the distribution of controlled substances including whether we are adequately detecting and preventing the illegal diversion of controlled substances we have received and may in the future receive requests for information and subpoenas from the dea various united states attorneys offices of the united states department of justice andor state regulatory agencies related to our distribution of controlled substances or our order monitoring program which is designed to prevent or detect the illegal diversion of controlled substances we generally respond to such subpoenas and requests in a cooperative thorough and timely manner these responses sometimes required time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred by the company such subpoenas and requests also can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil criminal or regulatory legal proceedings against the company as well as to settlements 

the dea fda and other federal and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

  legal regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of prescription drug costs the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations 

the affordable care act changed the formula for medicaid federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price amp the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms has released for review and comment a draft federal upper limit methodology and draft federal upper limits determined by using that methodology while the draft federal upper limit prices released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits currently in place the impact of the cms methodology cannot be determined until finalized any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and make other changes affecting medicaid rebate amounts the affordable care acts redefinition of amp is expected to result in most instances in a higher amp this higher amp coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business cms issued proposed regulations to implement the affordable care acts provisions regarding medicaid rebates and medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies but the regulations have not been finalized to date we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts for example a number of states have announced plans to use average acquisition cost to reimburse pharmacies for the cost of drugs there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

in february 2011 cms announced that it would be conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average actual pharmacy acquisition costs the results of which states may use to determine statespecific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates cms will use pharmacies invoiced drug acquisition costs as reported in the surveys to calculate the national average drug acquisition cost nadac cms released its draft methodology for calculating the nadac in may 2012 and began collecting survey data in june 2012 cms has released draft nadacs but the methodologies and files have not yet been finalized there can be no assurances that state pharmaceutical rates derived from this new survey data will not result in lower medicaid reimbursement levels or lead to other payers reducing their reimbursement levels that could adversely impact our business 

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and more conservative guidelines for recommended dosage and use any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues in addition on january 1 2011 cms began implementing a prospective payment system for medicare endstage renal disease esrd services that provides a single bundled payment to dialysis facilities covering most esrd services including anemia drugs there is a 4year transition period to the new prospective payment system and cms continues to make refinements to the payment policy we cannot at this time assess the impact this new payment system when fully implemented will have on our business 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional changes to the part d program since its enactment notably the affordable care act provides additional assistance to beneficiaries who reach the part d coverage gap including a manufacturer discount program mandates additional medication therapy management services and reduces part d subsidies for certain highincome beneficiaries cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance under the terms of the budget control act of 2011 automatic federal spending cuts known as sequestration went into effect as a result of congressional failure to adopt legislation meeting federal deficit reduction targets under this policy a 2 cut is being made to medicare provider and plan payments generally effective for services provided on or after april 1 2013 any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  absgs business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physicians office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some of our customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg this trend may continue due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms calculates average sales price asp for medicare part b drugs medicare generally reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of asp plus 6 federal changes in drug reimbursement policy have reduced and could continue to reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs for instance the implementation of sequestration in 2013 pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 has effectively reduced reimbursement below the asp plus 6 level for the duration of sequestration which lasts through fiscal year 2021 in the absence of additional legislation these reductions could accelerate the trend of physician practices moving to or being acquired by hospitals and could also indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in corresponding declines in absgs profitability any future reductions in the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

  if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of branded andor generic pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale purchase andor 

dispensing of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

the company has learned that there are filings in one or more federal district courts including a qui tam complaint filed by one of our former employees that are under seal and may involve allegations against the company andor subsidiaries or businesses of the company including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business relating to its distribution of certain pharmaceutical products to providers with regard to any of these filings our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if government authorities decide to intervene in any such pending cases andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such pending cases 

  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to execute our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the us are subject to various risks inherent in global operations the acquisition of world courier expanded our business globally with operations in over 50 countries worldwide we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local political changes and local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition the realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs andor cause losses as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

third party service providers are responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  anticipated benefits generally associated with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may not be fully realized 

we completed the implementation of an erp system that handles the business and financial processes within abdcs operations and our corporate and administrative functions such as i facilitating the purchase and distribution of inventory items from our distribution centers ii receiving processing and shipping orders on a timely basis iii managing the accuracy of billings and collections for our customers iv processing payments to our suppliers and v generating financial transactions and information if the anticipated benefits from this implementation are not fully realized our expected return on the erp investment will not be achieved 

  our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

the capital and credit markets could experience significant volatility and disruption if the markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

  tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition

recent developments 

on march 18 2013 we walgreens and alliance boots entered into various agreements and arrangements including a tenyear pharmaceutical distribution agreement between walgreens and us pursuant to which walgreens will source branded and generic pharmaceutical products from us an agreement which provides us with the ability to access generics and related pharmaceutical products through walgreens boots alliance development gmbh a global sourcing joint venture between walgreens and alliance boots opportunities to accelerate our efforts to grow our specialty and manufacturer services businesses domestically and internationally and agreements and arrangements pursuant to which walgreens and alliance boots together have the right but not the obligation to purchase a minority equity position in us and gain associated representation on our board of directors in certain circumstances we were already distributing mail order and other pharmaceutical products for walgreens the tenyear distribution agreement which was effective as of september 1 2013 expanded our relationship to include the distribution of branded and generic pharmaceutical products for walgreens branded pharmaceutical distribution began on september 1 2013 and beginning in fiscal 2014 we expect our distribution for walgreens to increasingly include generic pharmaceutical products that walgreens currently selfdistributes 

in connection with these arrangements we entered into a framework agreement with walgreens and alliance boots dated as of march 18 2013 pursuant to which i walgreens and alliance boots together were granted the right to purchase a minority equity position in amerisourcebergen corporation beginning with the right but not the obligation to purchase up to 19859795 shares of our common stock approximately 7 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming the exercise in full of the warrants as defined below in open market transactions with the right to designate up to two members of our board of directors upon achieving specified ownership levels ii walgreens pharmacy strategies llc a wholly owned subsidiary of walgreens was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 and iii alliance boots luxembourg sàrl a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance boots was issued a a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5150 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2016 and b a warrant to purchase up to 11348456 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of 5250 per share exercisable during a sixmonth period beginning in march 2017 collectively the warrants the warrants collectively represented approximately 16 of our common stock on a fully diluted basis as of the date of issuance assuming exercise in full of the warrants the number of shares which may be purchased in the open market is subject to increase in certain circumstances if the market price of our common stock is less than the exercise price of the first tranche of warrants when those warrants are exercisable in 2016 future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our then existing shareholders in addition prior to the exercise of the warrants any dilutive effect of the warrants will be reflected in our diluted earnings per share calculation the parties and affiliated entities also entered into certain related agreements governing relations between and among the parties thereto including the amerisourcebergen shareholders agreement dated as of march 18 2013 among walgreens alliance boots and us described in our current report on form 8k filed on march 20 2013

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines additionally absg provides third party logistics and outcomes research and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

both abdc and absg distribute specialty drugs to their customers with the principal difference between these two operating segments being that absg operates distribution facilities that focus primarily on complex disease treatment regimens therefore a product distributed from one of absgs distribution facilities results in revenue reported under absg and a product distributed from one of abdcs distribution centers results in revenue reported under abdc essentially all of absg sales consist of specialty pharmaceutical products abdc sales of specialty pharmaceutical products are a relatively small component of its overall revenue 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the world courier group inc world courier operating segment the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry 

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2013 compared with year ended september 30 2012 

revenue 



revenue of 880 billion in fiscal 2013 increased 127 from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to the revenue growth of both pharmaceutical distribution and other 

we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2014 to increase between 28 and 31 our expected growth rate is driven primarily by our new distribution contract with walgreens which became effective september 1 2013 fiscal 2014 will include eleven incremental months of brand drug distribution and the phasein of generic drug distribution to walgreens we are also forecasting a modest increase in revenue from the implementation of the affordable care act our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment grew its revenue by 123 from the prior fiscal year intrasegment revenues between abdc and absg have been eliminated in the presentation of total pharmaceutical distribution revenue these revenues primarily consisted of absg sales directly to abdc customer sites or absg sales to abdcs facilities total intrasegment revenues were 34 billion and 26 billion in the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively 

abdcs revenue of 721 billion increased 141 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations the increase in abdcs revenue was primarily due to increased sales to express scripts of 75 billion and walgreens of 29 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 the increased sales were offset in part by the loss of a food and drug retail group purchasing organization gpo customer which resulted in a 17 billion decrease in revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 additionally revenue was favorably impacted by an increase in brandname pharmaceutical prices and was unfavorably impacted by an increase in the use of lower priced generic pharmaceuticals the increased use of generic pharmaceuticals was the result of over 30 brand to generic conversions in fiscal 2012 

absgs revenue of 176 billion in fiscal 2013 increased 76 from the prior fiscal year before intrasegment eliminations primarily due to the growth in its blood products vaccine and physician office distribution businesses and its third party logistics business the physician office distribution business benefitted from increased sales of an ophthalmology drug in fiscal 2013 absgs revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales to community oncology practices the majority of absgs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology community oncologists and other specialty physicians that administer drugs under medicare part b experienced declining reimbursement rates for specialty pharmaceutical drugs in fiscal 2013 as a result some physician practices consolidated or sold their businesses to hospitals under federal sequestration legislation medicare physician reimbursement rates for part b drugs were further reduced on april 1 2013 while we service the needs of many hospitals the continuing shift in this service channel has reduced oncology revenue refer to item 1a risk factors for a more detailed description of this business risk absgs business may continue to be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in additional revenue reductions 

a number of our contracts with customers or group purchasing organizations gpos are typically subject to expiration each year we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed or replaced during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 no significant contracts expired over the next twelve months there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire 

other 

revenue in other increased 4388 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 2711 million incremental revenue contributions from world courier which was acquired in april 2012 

gross profit 



gross profit decreased 48 or approximately 1269 million from the prior fiscal year 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences due to the additional branded inventory that we were required to purchase to service the walgreens contract approximately 13 billion and the impact the branded inventory had on our annual inflation index as well as higher brand drug price inflation and lower generic drug price deflation we recorded a lifo charge of 2770 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 in fiscal 2014 our lifo charge will also be impacted by the walgreens onboarding 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit decreased 132 or approximately 3131 million from the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge pharmaceutical distribution gross profit decreased by 361 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge this decrease was primarily due to the lower gross profit related to the express scripts contract the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer the lower number of generic launches and the reduced contribution from sales of certain specialty oncology drugs this decrease was offset in part by stronger price appreciation related to generic drugs and the growth of our nononcology specialty distribution businesses in the current fiscal year we recognized a gain of 229 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in comparison to a gain of 148 million in the prior fiscal year these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold we are unable to estimate future gains if any that we will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation settlements see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 237 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 70 basis points from the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 269 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 38 basis points from the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge the pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin decline in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 was primarily due to lower gross profit margin related to the current express scripts contract the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer and competitive pressures on customer margins 

gross profit in other increased by 1862 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the 1613 million incremental contributions made by our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier as a percentage of revenue other gross profit margin of 2595 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 increased from 2049 in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the gross profit contributions from our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2013 increased 157 or approximately 1812 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the incremental operating costs of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier and additional costs to support the onboarding of our new distribution agreement with walgreens 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier and due to an increase in capital projects amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to our fiscal 2012 acquisition of world courier 

warrant expense was 901 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 the warrants were issued in march 2013 in connection with the agreements and arrangements that define our strategic relationship with walgreens and alliance boots refer to the critical accounting policies and estimates — warrants on page 29 for a more detailed description of the accounting for the warrants future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly 

employee severance litigation and other for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 included 230 million of dealrelated transaction costs primarily related to professional fees with respect to the walgreens and alliance boots transaction and 05 million of employee severance and facility closure costs 

in fiscal 2012 we introduced a number of initiatives some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions in connection with these initiatives we recorded 330 million of employee severance and other related costs other costs included an estimated 103 million liability to exit our participation in a multiemployer pension plan resulting from a abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal 2013 in addition we incurred 111 million of dealrelated transaction costs in connection with business combinations 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 183 in fiscal 2013 an increase of 13 basis points from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the warrant expense and the addition of our fiscal 2012 world courier acquisition which has higher operating expenses as a percentage of revenue for the pharmaceutical distribution segment as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were down 10 basis points from the prior fiscal year 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before warrant expense and employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income decreased 279 or approximately 3562 million from the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge pharmaceutical distribution operating income decreased 62 or approximately 792 million from the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution operating income margin was 138 and 166 in fiscal 2013 and 2012 respectively the 28 basis point decline in pharmaceutical distribution operating margin from the prior fiscal year was due to decreased contributions from generic launches a shift in customer mix towards lower margin business in abdc most notably the express scripts contract the loss of a food and drug retail gpo customer and a decline in the operating margin of our oncology business 

operating income in other increased 203 million from the prior fiscal year due to the incremental contribution made by our fiscal 2012 world courier acquisition and an increase in operating income from our abcs businesses 

interest expense interest income and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2013 and 2012 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense decreased from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease of 3238 million in average borrowings primarily due to the repayment of our 392 million 5 5  8  senior notes in september 2012 offset in part by the issuance of our 500 million 3 1  2  senior notes in november 2011 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash we currently expect our interest expense to be higher in fiscal 2014 due to increased shortterm borrowings to fund working capital needs associated with the onboarding of the walgreens business 

income taxes in fiscal 2013 reflect an effective tax rate of 402 compared to 374 in the prior fiscal year our effective tax rate is higher in fiscal 2013 because a portion of the warrant expense is not tax deductible excluding the impact of warrant expense our effective tax rate in fiscal 2013 was 377 our future effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending upon the quarterly valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes excluding the impact of warrant expense we expect that our effective tax rate in fiscal 2014 will be in the low 38 range 

income from continuing operations of 4934 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 352 from the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 210 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 decreased 291 from 296 in the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge and warrant expense income from continuing operations was 7395 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 a 29 decrease from the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share from continuing operations excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge and warrant expense was 314 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 a 61 increase from the prior fiscal year excluding the fiscal 2013 lifo charge and warrant expense the percentage difference between the change in diluted earnings per share and the change in income from continuing operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 was due to the 84 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

 loss income from discontinued operations net of income taxes for all periods presented includes the operating results of andersonbrecon ab and amerisourcebergen canada corporation abcc the loss before income taxes in the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 includes an abcc goodwill impairment charge and the loss on the sale of abcc this loss is net of a gain on the sale of ab 

year ended september 30 2012 compared with year ended september 30 2011 

revenue 



revenue of 781 billion in fiscal 2012 decreased 08 from the prior fiscal year as abdcs revenue declined 3 and was partially offset by the 6 revenue increase of absg additionally our fiscal 2012 acquisitions with theracom and world courier being the largest contributors added 1 to our revenue growth in the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

abdcs revenue decreased 3 from the prior fiscal year the decline in abdcs revenue was primarily due to the increase in use of lower priced generics a reduction in chain customer revenue primarily due to the previously announced loss of one of our larger retail customers the former longs drugs which was acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract prior to september 30 2011 and lower sales to its largest customer the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in brandname pharmaceutical prices 

absgs revenue of 164 billion in fiscal 2012 increased 6 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in its third party logistics business and growth in its vaccine and physician office distribution business which has benefited from sales of a new ophthalmology drug absgs revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of certain specialty oncology drugs 

other 

revenue in other increased 10 billion from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 9599 million contribution from our theracom and world courier acquisitions 

gross profit 



gross profit in fiscal 2012 increased 1757 million from the prior fiscal year 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 07 million and 347 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively our lifo charge in fiscal 2012 was lower than the prior fiscal year charge due to higher brand inventory sales prior to the end of our fiscal year 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit increased 02 or approximately 53 million from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to the solid growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs and brand price increases which were offset in part by the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs and by competitive pressures on customer margins as expected in fiscal 2012 the gross profit contributions from the sales of oxaliplatin gemcitabine and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were approximately 132 million lower than the prior fiscal year we had no sales of oxaliplatin in fiscal 2012 until midaugust 2012 and therefore gross profit on the sale of oxaliplatin was significantly lower than in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2012 the gross profit decline from the abovementioned three specialty generic drugs was partially offset by the gross profit contribution from over 30 abdc brand to generic product conversions in fiscal 2012 we recognized a gain of 148 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this compared to a recognized gain of 21 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold additionally in fiscal 2011 gross profit was impacted by a nonrecurring 12 million benefit in connection with a customer being acquired by a third party 

as a percentage of revenue pharmaceutical distribution gross profit margin of 307 in fiscal 2012 increased 6 basis points from the prior fiscal year the gross profit margin increase was due to the solid growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs which was partially offset by the decline in gross profit relating to the above mentioned specialty oncology generic drugs additionally the gain on antitrust litigation settlements as noted above contributed 2 basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 

gross profit in other increased by 1704 million in fiscal 2012 the increase in gross profit was due to the contributions made by our fiscal 2012 acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom as a percentage of revenue other gross profit margin of 2049 in fiscal 2012 decreased from 3345 in fiscal 2011 this decrease was primarily due to the lower gross profit margin of our fiscal 2012 acquisition of theracom

distribution selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2012 increased 13 due to the operating costs of our recently acquired companies and was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses within our pharmaceutical distribution segment and a decrease in our bad debt expense 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the implementation of our new erp system amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the theracom and world courier acquisitions 

in fiscal 2012 we introduced a number of initiatives some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions in connection with these initiatives we recorded 330 million of severance and other related costs other costs included an estimated 103 million liability to exit our participation in a multiemployer pension plan resulting from a planned abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal 2013 in addition we incurred 111 million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 

in fiscal 2011 we introduced our energiz program which encompassed a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity improve customer contractual compliance and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations employee severance litigation and other for fiscal 2011 included employee severance costs of 44 million related to our energiz program a 160 million charge related to the preliminary settlement of a qui tam legal matter and 32 million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 

we incurred a 65 million charge related to intangible asset impairments in fiscal 2011 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 170 in fiscal 2012 up 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year this was primarily due to our recent acquisitions for the pharmaceutical distribution segment as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were down 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased 910 million from the prior fiscal year due to the decrease in its operating expenses offset in part by a decrease in its gross profit operating income in other increased 437 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 246 million of contributions made by our recent acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom 

the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the costs relating to employee severance litigation and other and the asset impairments was to decrease operating income as a percentage of revenue by 4 basis points in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 

other income of 58 million in fiscal 2012 and 46 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 3898 million in average borrowings primarily due to the november 2011 issuance of our new 500 million 3 1  2  senior notes due 2021 in addition interest costs capitalized related to our business transformation project of 05 million and 34 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively had the effect of reducing interest expense for those periods our average invested cash was 15 billion during both fiscal 2012 and 2011 despite the similar levels of average cash interest income was lower in fiscal 2012 due to an increase in the amount of cash held in noninterest bearing cash accounts cash held in these accounts partially offset bank fees 

income taxes in fiscal 2012 reflect an effective tax rate of 374 compared to 376 in the prior fiscal year 

income from continuing operations of 7614 million in fiscal 2012 increased 9 from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income and was offset in part by the increases in interest expense and income taxes diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 296 in fiscal 2012 increased 18 from 251 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 8 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

 loss income from discontinued operations net of income taxes of 424 million and 91 million represents the operating results of andersonbrecon and abcc in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 2012 and 2011 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2013 2012 and 2011 was 201 million 231 million and 379 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2013 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 61 million 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2013 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 133 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

in the ordinary course of business we become involved in lawsuits administrative proceedings government subpoenas and government investigations including antitrust commercial environmental product liability intellectual property regulatory employment discrimination and other matters significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters and some matters may require years to resolve we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable we also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued if a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements we review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 83 and 82 of our inventories at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 5337 million and 2567 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2013 and 2012 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 2770 million 07 million and 347 million in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 respectively the annual lifo provision is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences many of which are difficult to predict our lifo charge in fiscal 2013 was significant due to the additional branded inventory we were required to purchase for the new walgreens distribution contract and the impact the branded inventory had on our annual inflation index as well as higher brand drug price inflation and lower generic drug price deflation in fiscal 2014 our lifo charge will also be impacted by the walgreens onboarding 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company including the fair value of any contingent consideration is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily trademarks and trade names are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment at least annually for the purpose of these impairment tests we can elect to perform a qualitative analysis to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets we elected to bypass performing the qualitative screen and went directly to performing the first step quantitative analysis of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment tests in the current year we may elect to perform the qualitative analysis in future periods 

the first step in the quantitative process for the goodwill impairment test is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further evaluation is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step must be completed which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill we would be required to record any such impairment losses 

we identify our reporting units at the operating segment level generally goodwill arises from acquisitions of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides 

we utilize a combination of income and marketbased approaches to valuation for its reporting units the income approach to valuation relies on a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of each reporting unit which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate we believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of its reporting units in a sale transaction the annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth operating margins depreciation amortization and working capital requirements which are based upon our longrange plan the discount rate is an estimate of the overall aftertax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both equity and debt including a risk premium while we use the best available information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances while there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged 

the impairment test for indefinitelived intangibles other than goodwill primarily trademarks and trade names consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinitelived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date we estimate the fair value of our indefinitelived intangibles using the relief from royalty method we believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets the fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 and as a result recorded 65 million of impairment charges in fiscal 2011 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option expected volatility riskfree interest rate dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

warrants 

we account for the warrants issued to walgreens and alliance boots in accordance with the guidance for equitybased payments to nonemployees the various agreements and arrangements with walgreens and alliance boots established various performance commitments that they must satisfy during the vesting periods of the warrants and if not fulfilled we have the right to cancel the warrants using a binomial lattice model approach the fair value of the warrants was initially measured at the date of issuance and is being expensed over the three and four year vesting periods as an operating expense the fair value of the warrants are remeasured at the end of each quarterly reporting period and an adjustment is recorded in the statement of operations to record the impact as if the newly measured fair value of the awards had been used in recognizing expense starting when the awards were originally issued and through the remeasurement date in total the warrants were valued at 5720 million as of september 30 2013 the valuation of the warrants considers our common stock price and various assumptions such as the volatility of our common stock the expected remaining life of the warrants the expected dividend yield and the riskfree interest rate as a result future warrant expense could fluctuate significantly 

a portion of the warrant expense is not tax deductible therefore our future effective income tax rate could fluctuate significantly depending on the valuation of the warrants for financial reporting purposes 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 82 million in fiscal 2013 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2013 including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility the receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note in thousands 



along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility our receivables securitization facility and the revolving credit note provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 

we have a 14 billion multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in july 2018 the multicurrency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 130 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable 90 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee at september 30 2013 additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points annually of the total commitment 10 basis points at september 30 2013 we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test as well as others that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales with which we are compliant as of september 30 2013 

we have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue shortterm promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to 700 million at any one time amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed from time to time the maturities on the notes will vary but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance the notes will bear interest rates if interest bearing or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multicurrency revolving credit facility there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at september 30 2013 

we have a 950 million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility which is scheduled to expire in june 2016 we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee of 75 basis points we currently pay an unused fee of 40 basis points annually to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility at september 30 2013 there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility which contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 

we have an uncommitted unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note revolving credit note for an aggregate principal amount not to exceed 45 million the revolving credit note provides us with the ability to request shortterm unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed 45 million at any time outstanding 

we have 500 million of 5 7  8  senior notes due september 15 2015 the 2015 notes 400 million of 4 7  8  senior notes due november 15 2019 the 2019 notes and 500 million of 3 1  2  senior notes due november 15 2021 the 2021 notes the 2015 notes were sold at 995 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 594 the 2019 notes were sold in november 2009 at 99174 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 498 the 2021 notes were sold in november 2011 at 99858 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 352 interest on the 2015 notes the 2019 notes and the 2021 notes is payable semiannually in arrears all of the senior notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the repayment of debt fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities in may 2012 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million shares of our common stock subject to market conditions during the quarter ended december 31 2012 we purchased 969 million of our common stock to complete our authorization under this 750 million share repurchase program in november 2012 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million shares of our common stock subject to market conditions during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 we purchased 3870 million of our common stock under the share repurchase program as of september 30 2013 we had 3630 million of availability remaining on the 750 million share repurchase program on august 8 2013 our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million additional shares of our common stock subject to market conditions we currently expect to purchase approximately 500 million of our common stock in fiscal 2014 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

if walgreens andor alliance boots exercise their rights to purchase our common stock pursuant to the warrants that we issued to them the future issuances of shares of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants will dilute the ownership interests of our thenexisting stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock we intend to mitigate the potentially dilutive effect that exercise of the warrants could have by hedging a portion of our future obligation to deliver common stock with a financial institution and repurchasing additional shares of our common stock for our own account over time in june 2013 we commenced our hedging strategy by entering into a contract with a financial institution pursuant to which it will execute a series of issuer capped call transactions capped calls the capped calls give us the right to buy approximately 60 of the shares of our common stock subject to the warrants at specified prices at maturity should the warrants be exercised in 2016 and 2017 and assuming our future share price does not exceed the capped call limits if our future share price at the exercise dates is lower than we expect then our use of capital for the purchase of the capped calls would be ineffective to the extent the capped calls do not mitigate the dilutive effect of the warrants we intend to consider repurchasing additional shares of our common stock the amount of dilution that we would be able to mitigate will depend on the relative costs and benefits of such a transaction considering factors such as our financial performance the current and future share price of our common stock our expected cash flows competing priorities for capital and overall market conditions 

as of september 30 2013 we purchased capped calls on 153 million shares of our common stock for a total premium of 1634 million of which 1573 million was paid as of september 30 2013 and the remainder is accrued as of that date we believe that we have sufficient capital resources to fund the remaining cost of the hedge strategy 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2013 in thousands 



we have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 20142015 flu season we are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately 369 million as of september 30 2013 of which 285 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2014 these influenza vaccine commitments are included in other commitments in the above table 

we have outsourced to ibm global services ibm a significant portion of our corporate and abdc information technology activities the remaining commitment under our 10year arrangement as amended which expires in june 2015 is approximately 541 million as of september 30 2013 of which 313 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2014 and is included in other commitments in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 554 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2013 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 

during fiscal 2013 our operating activities provided 7881 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 13054 million in the prior fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal 2013 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 4934 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 38183 million and noncash items of 3465 million offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of 23125 million and an increase in merchandise inventories of 14866 million accounts receivable increased from september 30 2012 as the result of increased volume associated with our current express scripts and walgreens contracts additionally while the payment terms in the current express scripts contract are favorable they are less favorable than the payment terms in the previous medco contract as a result there was a negative impact on our working capital in fiscal 2013 we also increased our merchandise inventories at september 30 2013 to support the increased volume due to the current express scripts and walgreens contracts the 38183 million increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in business volume and the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers 

we use days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance the increase in days sales outstanding from the prior fiscal year reflects the payment terms under the current express scripts contract 



our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based on fluctuations in our period end working capital the onboarding of the walgreens business in september 2013 had a negative impact on our cash flow from operating activities and on our working capital in the amount of approximately 500 million however we benefitted in fiscal 2013 from certain inventory purchases in the fourth quarter having extended payment terms relating to our walgreens contract which will negatively impact the cash flow in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 operating cash uses during fiscal 2013 included 685 million of interest payments and 3137 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

during fiscal 2012 our operating activities provided 13054 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 11679 million in fiscal 2011 cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 7614 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 4161 million and noncash items of 2416 million offset in part by an increase in merchandise inventories of 1162 million noncash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of 613 million which represented a 1335 million decline from fiscal 2011 deferred income taxes were significantly higher in fiscal 2011 due to the larger income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our business transformation capital expenditures the 4161 million increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers merchandise inventories increased 1162 million from the september 30 2011 balance due to the timing of inventory purchases 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 were 2025 million 1333 million and 1561 million respectively significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 included the purchase of one of our leased distribution facilities technology initiatives including costs related to the further development of our erp system technologyrelated costs to onboard the incremental walgreens distribution volume and expansion costs related to one of abdcs facilities our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and 2011 related principally to our business transformation project which included a new erp system for our corporate office and for our abdc operations significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 also included abdc and abcs facility expansions and improvements other capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 and 2011 included abdc purchases of machinery and equipment which were previously sold to financial institutions and leased back by us and other technology initiatives 

we currently expect to spend approximately 300 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2014 several of the larger 2014 capital expenditures include the replacement of a distribution center the creation of a national distribution center the implementation of trackandtrace authentication technology and information system investments to support increased order volume and future growth 

in may 2013 we divested ab and received 3065 million of cash net of a working capital adjustment and divested abcc and received 235 million of cash the abcc divestiture continues to be subject to a final purchase price working capital adjustment 

in april 2012 we acquired world courier for a purchase price of 5180 million net of a working capital adjustment in november 2011 we acquired theracom for a purchase price of 2572 million net of a working capital adjustment additionally in fiscal 2012 we finalized working capital adjustments relating to our september 2011 acquisitions of intrinsiq llc intrinsiq and premier source premier totaling 05 million net 

in september 2011 we acquired intrinsiq for a purchase price of 343 million net of a working capital adjustment additionally in september 2011 we acquired premier for a purchase price of 111 million net of cash acquired 

net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2013 2012 and 2011 included the purchase of 4842 million 11622 million and 8406 million respectively of our common stock in connection with our share repurchase programs 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2013 we paid 1573 million to purchase capped calls to hedge the potential dilution associated with the warrants upon their exercise 

fiscal 2012 included 4993 million of proceeds received related to the november 2011 issuance of our 2021 notes and the repayments of 3923 million of senior notes due september 15 2012 and 55 million due under a terminated credit facility 

our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases 



we anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future however the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings financial condition capital requirements and other factors 

market risk 

we have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2013 we had no variable rate debt outstanding the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2013 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 12 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2013 none of which was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc ims an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow approximately 1 to 4 annually through 2016 ims expects that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

  aging population the number of individuals age 65 and over in the united states is expected to exceed 48 million by 2016 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

  increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a significant number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years during our fiscal 2012 there were over 30 brandname to generic conversions in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 80 of the prescription volume in the united states 

  increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 12 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

  legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates more recently in march 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which would increase the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 5 for further details

operations 

  operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2012 are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs and world courier operating segments 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

other 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry as of september 30 2012 we committed to a plan to divest andersonbrecon which was previously included in other therefore its operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

  suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 8 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2012 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2012 accounted for approximately 50 of our purchases 

  information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized enterprise resource planning erp system abdcs erp system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdcs systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing third party claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc has a warehouse operating system which is used to account for the majority of abdcs transactional volume the warehouse operating system has improved abdcs productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services and other third party service providers 

in an effort to continue to make system investments to further improve our information technology capabilities and meet our future customer and operational needs we began to make significant investments in fiscal 2008 relating to our business transformation project that includes a new erp system the erp system includes the development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance our business practices and lower costs since october 2010 the majority of our corporate and administrative functions have been operating on our new erp system additionally twentytwo of our twentysix abdc distribution facilities have implemented and are using passport our new webbased customer facing application with enhanced ordering and product catalog features we expect to continue the implementation of the erp system including passport and as a result expect to continue to make investments in our business transformation project 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized erp system resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest national competitors are cardinal health inc cardinal and mckesson corporation mckesson abdc competes with both cardinal and mckesson as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absgs operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc and ups logistics among others our consulting and world courier businesses also face competition from a variety of competitors in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2012 we had approximately 14500 employees of which approximately 13400 were fulltime employees of the total number of employees approximately 1400 are employees of andersonbrecon approximately 3 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration dea the us food and drug administration fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 these and other requirements are expected to increase the cost of our operations 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006 these fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase our costs andor burden of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni which would be coded into the data carrier applied by the manufacturer in march 2010 the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development and implementation of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of their prescription drug costs the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid in addition among other things the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system for instance the budget control act of 2011 established a congressional committee charged with identifying 15 trillion in deficit reduction provisions which could include reductions in medicare andor medicaid spending the budget control act of 2011 also provided for automatic federal spending cuts of 12 trillion in january 2012 a process known as sequestration if congress failed to adopt legislation meeting federal deficit reduction targets by january 2012 reductions in payments to medicare providers under this process would be capped at 2 there would be no reduction in medicaid payments the committee did not meet the statutory deadline for producing deficit reduction legislation and therefore sequestration will be triggered in january 2013 unless congress and the white house are able to reach agreement on deficit reduction items before that time any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition in recent years the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes as a result of legislative and regulatory efforts to reduce costs and government spending in 2006 the ontario government enacted the transparent drug system for patients act which significantly revised the drug distribution system in ontario in 2010 the ontario government reformed regulations governing the sale of generic drugs in the province to reduce costs for taxpayers these changes lowered the prices for generic pharmaceuticals in both the public governmentsponsored plans and private markets and eliminated professional allowances paid to pharmacists these regulatory changes in ontario and ongoing efforts elsewhere in canada to reduce reimbursement for pharmaceuticals impact our canadian customers and our canadian drug distribution businesses 

see risk factors below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information and personal practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and its accompanying federal regulations set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information in addition our operations depending on their location may be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

enacted in 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act arra strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect personallyidentifiable health information a section of the arra known as the health information technology for economic and clinical health act hitech act strengthened certain aspects of the hipaa privacy and security rules imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches broadened the rights of the us department of health and human services hhs to enforce hipaa and directed hhs to publish more specific security standards the new rules have not yet been implemented by hhs 

some of our businesses collect maintain andor access other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information in addition to the requirements of hipaa and the hitech act security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate 

there can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements including new hitech act requirements once fully effective will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals cardinal and mckesson regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals national generic distributors chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies see competition competition continues to increase in specialty distribution and services where gross margins historically have been higher than in abdc reflecting that increased competition our two national competitors have continued to expand their footprint in the area of specialty distribution and services if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

  our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased less than 10 of our gross profit from brandname manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

  declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

in recent years the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption if the markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

  our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

in fiscal 2012 our largest customer medco was acquired by express scripts medco accounted for 17 of our revenue in fiscal 2012 we recently signed a three year agreement effective october 1 2012 to supply primarily brandname pharmaceuticals to express scripts our top ten customers represented approximately 41 of fiscal 2012 revenue we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations gpos each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 11 of our revenue in fiscal 2012 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

  our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2012 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 10 and 5 of accounts receivable net 

  our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

  increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006 the fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni in march 2010 fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fdas development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

  the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by the dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

  legal regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined 

federal insurance and health care reform legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of prescription drug costs the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations 

the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price amp the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms have released for review and comment a draft federal upper limit methodology and draft federal upper limits determined by using that methodology while the draft federal upper limit prices released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits currently in place the impact of the cms methodology cannot be determined until finalized any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and make other changes affecting medicaid rebate amounts the affordable care acts redefinition of amp is expected to result in most instances in a higher amp this higher amp coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business cms issued proposed regulations to implement the acas provisions regarding medicaid rebates and medicaid reimbursement to pharmacies but the regulations have not been finalized to date we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business the federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts for example a number of states have announced plans to use average acquisition cost to reimburse pharmacies for the cost of drugs there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

in february 2011 cms announced that it would be conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average actual pharmacy acquisition costs the results of which states may use to determine statespecific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates cms will use pharmacies invoiced drug acquisition costs as reported in the surveys to calculate the national average drug acquisition cost nadac cms released its draft methodology for calculating the nadac in may 2012 and began collecting survey data in june 2012 cms has not yet released any calculated nadacs there can be no assurances that state pharmaceutical rates derived from this new survey data will not result in lower medicaid reimbursement levels or lead to other payers reducing their reimbursement levels that could adversely impact our business 

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and more conservative guidelines for recommended dosage and use any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues in addition on january 1 2011 cms began implementing a prospective payment system for medicare endstage renal disease esrd services that provides a single bundled payment to dialysis facilities covering most esrd services including anemia drugs there is a 4year transition period to the new prospective payment system we cannot at this time assess the impact this new payment system when fully implemented will have on our business 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional changes to the part d program since its enactment notably the affordable care act provides additional assistance to beneficiaries who reach the part d coverage gap including a manufacturer discount program mandates additional medication therapy management services and reduces part d subsidies for certain highincome beneficiaries cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance the budget control act of 2011 established a congressional committee charged with identifying 15 trillion in deficit reduction provisions which could include reductions in medicare andor medicaid spending the budget control act of 2011 also provided for automatic federal spending cuts of 12 trillion in january 2013 a process known as sequestration if congress failed to adopt legislation meeting federal deficit reduction targets by january 2012 reductions in payments to medicare providers under this process would be capped at 2 while medicaid would be exempt from such reductions the committee did not meet the statutory deadline for producing deficit reduction legislation and therefore sequestration will be triggered in january 2013 unless congress and the white house are able to reach agreement on deficit reduction items before that time any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  absgs business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physicians office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg this trend may continue due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms calculates average sales price asp for medicare part b drugs because medicare currently reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of asp plus six percent changes in asp have reduced and could continue to reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs these reductions could accelerate the trend of physician practices moving to or being acquired by hospitals and could also indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in corresponding declines in absgs profitability in addition deficit reduction measures pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 could include reductions in medicare spending such as lower reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs any future reductions in the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b or physician services under medicare could negatively impact our customers businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

  if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  the enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in canada including the profitability of that business 

consistent with our operations in the united states our products and services function within the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in canada the purchase of pharmaceutical products in canada is funded in part by the provincial governments which each regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently in recent years like the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending for example in 2006 the ontario government enacted the transparent drug system for patients act which significantly revised the drug distribution system in ontario on july 1 2010 the ontario government finalized regulatory changes to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs in ontario to reduce costs for taxpayers these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals in both the public governmentsponsored plans and private markets and the elimination of professional allowances paid to pharmacists changes in generic drug prices also affect the cash values of the percentage markups that may be charged by pharmacies these reforms may result in lower service fees cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services in addition any fees based on percentage of drug prices will be reduced by any reductions to generic drug prices themselves legislation andor regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well the legislative changes in ontario had an immediate impact on quebec because it requires manufacturers to sell pharmaceuticals to quebec at the lowest price in canada the governments of alberta and british columbia have also taken steps to reduce the prices for generic drugs listed on their formularies we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability in canada revenue from our canadian operations in fiscal 2012 was approximately 2 of our consolidated revenue 

  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of branded pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale purchase andor dispensing of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

on october 24 2011 we announced that we had reached a preliminary agreement for a civil settlement the preliminary settlement with the united states attorneys office for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff states and the relator collectively the plaintiffs of the claims in a civil case that was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the district of massachusetts case under the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts against two business units of the company which are subsidiaries of amerisourcebergen specialty group international nephrology network inn a group purchasing organization for nephrologists and nephrology practices and asd specialty healthcare inc asd which is a distributor of pharmaceuticals to physician practices the relator was a former employee of amgen inc which was also a defendant in the case the civil case was administratively closed after the preliminary settlement was reached the preliminary settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement with the plaintiffs which we expect to finalize in fiscal year 2013 we do not expect inn or asd to admit any liability in connection with the settlement we recorded a 16 million charge in fiscal 2011 in connection with the preliminary settlement the matter is described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition we have learned that there are prior and subsequent filings in one or more federal district courts including a complaint filed by one of our former employees that are under seal and involve allegations against the company andor subsidiaries or businesses of the company including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business similar to those raised in the district of massachusetts case the preliminary settlement encompasses resolution of one of these other filings with regard to any of these filings not encompassed by the preliminary settlement our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if government authorities decide to intervene in any such pending cases andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such pending cases 

  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to execute our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations 

our operations in jurisdictions outside of the us are subject to various risks inherent in global operations the acquisition of world courier expanded our business globally with operations in over 50 countries worldwide we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time our global operations may be affected by local political changes and local economic environments including inflation recession currency volatility and competition the realization of any of these factors could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  violations of antibribery anticorruption andor international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations 

we are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business for example we are subject to the us foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa us export control and trade sanction laws and similar anticorruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries such as the uk bribery act any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market the fcpa generally prohibits us companies and their officers directors employees and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment the fcpa also requires that us public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls if we are found to have violated the fcpa we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines disgorgement of profits and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses from time to time we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities compliance with which could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations an adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties which could adversely affect our business financial position and results of operations 

  risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs andor cause losses as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

third party service providers are responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  anticipated benefits generally associated with the implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may not be fully realized 

we are nearing the completion of the implementation of an erp system which when completed will handle the business and financial processes within abdcs operations and our corporate and administrative functions such as i facilitating the purchase and distribution of inventory items from our distribution centers ii receiving processing and shipping orders on a timely basis iii managing the accuracy of billings and collections for our customers iv processing payments to our suppliers and v generating financial transactions and information if the anticipated benefits from this implementation are not fully realized our expected return on the erp investment will not be achieved 

  tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and select global markets as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of various foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

we are a pharmaceutical services company serving the united states canada and selected global markets we provide drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to our pharmacy physician and manufacturer customers we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations are comprised of the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment and other 

as of september 30 2012 we committed to a plan to divest andersonbrecon a business unit within amerisourcebergen consulting services therefore its operations are classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented all historical information provided herein has been retroactively adjusted to conform to our current presentation 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segments operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname pharmaceuticals including specialty pharmaceutical products and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers additionally abdc delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers

our use of the term specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products refers to drugs used to treat complex diseases such as cancer diabetes and multiple sclerosis specialty pharmaceutical products are part of complex treatment regimens for serious conditions and diseases that generally require ongoing clinical monitoring we believe the terms specialty and specialty pharmaceutical products are used consistently by industry participants and our competitors however we cannot be certain that other distributors of specialty products define these and other similar terms in exactly the same manner as we do 

other 

other consists of the amerisourcebergen consulting services abcs operating segment and the recently acquired world courier group inc world courier operating segment the results of operations of our abcs and world courier operating segments are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and therefore have been included in other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers world courier which operates in over 50 countries is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry 

acquisitions 

in november 2011 we acquired theracom llc theracom a subsidiary of cvs caremark corporation for a purchase price of 2572 million net of a working capital adjustment theracom is a leading provider of commercialization support services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry specifically providing reimbursement and patient access support services theracoms capabilities complement those of the lash group a business unit within abcs and significantly increase the size and scope of its consulting services theracoms annualized revenues are approximately 700 million the majority of which are provided by the specialized distribution component of the integrated reimbursement support services for certain unique prescription products

results of operations 

year ended september 30 2012 compared with year ended september 30 2011 

revenue 



revenue of 795 billion in fiscal 2012 decreased 06 from the prior fiscal year as abdcs revenue declined 3 and was partially offset by the 6 revenue increase of absg additionally our recent acquisitions with theracom and world courier being the largest contributors added 1 to our revenue growth in the fiscal year ended september 30 2012 

we currently expect our revenue in fiscal 2013 to increase between 6 and 9 our expected growth rate reflects our new threeyear contract with express scripts inc express scripts that is effective as of october 1 2012 to supply primarily brandname pharmaceuticals annual sales to express scripts in fiscal 2013 under this contract are estimated to be 185 billion in early april 2012 our largest customer medco health solutions inc medco merged with express scripts which is the surviving corporation medco accounted for 17 of our revenue in fiscal 2012 in addition fiscal 2013 will include a full years operating results of our fiscal 2012 acquisitions of theracom and world courier our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

abdcs revenue decreased 3 from the prior fiscal year the decline in abdcs revenue was primarily due to the increase in use of lower priced generics a reduction in chain customer revenue primarily due to the previously announced loss of one of our larger retail customers the former longs drugs which was acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract prior to september 30 2011 and lower sales to its largest customer the decrease in revenue was partially offset by an increase in brandname pharmaceutical prices 

absgs revenue of 164 billion in fiscal 2012 increased 6 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth in its thirdparty logistics business and growth in its vaccine and physician office distribution business which has benefited from sales of a new ophthalmology drug absgs revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in sales of certain specialty oncology drugs the majority of absgs revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absgs business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues 

during fiscal 2012 72 of pharmaceutical distribution revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 28 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2011 of 70 institutional and 30 retail sales to institutional customers remained flat in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers decreased 7 from the prior fiscal year 

other 

other revenue increased 10227 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 9599 million contribution from our theracom and world courier acquisitions 

gross profit 



gross profit in fiscal 2012 increased 1675 million from the prior fiscal year due to the contributions made by our recent acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom the solid growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs and brand price increases all of which were offset in part by the reduced contribution from the sales of certain specialty oncology drugs and by competitive pressures on customer margins as expected in fiscal 2012 the gross profit contributions from the sales of oxaliplatin gemcitabine and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were approximately 132 million lower than the prior fiscal year we had no sales of oxaliplatin in our current fiscal year until midaugust 2012 and therefore gross profit on the sale of oxaliplatin was significantly lower than in fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2012 the gross profit decline from the abovementioned three specialty generic drugs was partially offset by the gross profit contribution from over 30 abdc brand to generic product conversions in the current fiscal year we recognized a gain of 148 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this compared to a recognized gain of 21 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold we are unable to estimate future gains if any that we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally in fiscal 2011 our gross profit was impacted by a nonrecurring 12 million benefit in connection with a customer being acquired by a third party 

as a percentage of revenue our gross profit margin of 336 in fiscal 2012 increased 23 basis points from the prior fiscal year the gross profit margin increase was due to the gross profit contributions of our recent acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom and the solid growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs both of which were offset by the decline in gross profit relating to the above mentioned specialty oncology generic drugs additionally the gain on antitrust litigation settlements as noted above contributed 2 basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal 2012 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout lifo provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 07 million and 347 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively our lifo charge in fiscal 2012 was lower than the prior fiscal year charge due to higher brand inventory sales prior to the end of our fiscal year 

operating expenses 



distribution selling and administrative expense in fiscal 2012 increased 43 due to the operating costs of our recently acquired companies and was partially offset by a reduction in consulting expenses within our pharmaceutical distribution segment and a decrease in our bad debt expense 

depreciation expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the implementation of our new erp system amortization expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the newly acquired intangible assets resulting from the theracom and world courier acquisitions 

in fiscal 2012 we introduced a number of initiatives some of which were made possible as a result of efficiencies gained through our erp implementation to improve our operating efficiency across many of our businesses and certain administrative functions in connection with these initiatives we recorded 347 million of severance and other related costs and through september 30 2012 47 employees have been severed other costs include an estimated 103 million liability to exit our participation in a multiemployer pension plan resulting from a planned abdc distribution facility closure in fiscal 2013 in addition we incurred 111 million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 

in fiscal 2011 we introduced our energiz program which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity improve customer contractual compliance and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations employee severance litigation and other for fiscal 2011 included severance costs of 44 million related to our energiz program a 160 million charge related to the preliminary settlement of a qui tam matter as described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and 32 million of acquisition costs related to business combinations 

we incurred a 65 million charge related to intangible asset impairments in fiscal 2011 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 178 in fiscal 2012 up 14 basis points from the prior fiscal year this was primarily due to our recent acquisitions for the pharmaceutical distribution segment as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were down 4 basis points from the prior fiscal year 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased 445 million from the prior fiscal year due to the decrease in its operating expenses offset in part by a decrease in its gross profit other operating income increased 437 million from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 246 million of contributions made by our recent acquisitions primarily world courier and theracom we expect our operating income margin to decline in fiscal 2013 due to our new express scripts contract which significantly increases our mix of lowermargin brand business the loss of a large fooddrug combo customer the negative impact of certain customer contract renewals and a lower number of brand to generic conversions expected in fiscal 2013 

the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the costs relating to employee severance litigation and other and the asset impairments was to decrease operating income as a percentage of revenue by 4 basis points in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 

other income of 58 million in fiscal 2012 and 46 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition 

interest expense interest income and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 4944 million in average borrowings primarily due to the november 2011 issuance of our new 500 million 3 1  2  senior notes due 2021 in addition interest costs capitalized related to our business transformation project of 05 million and 34 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively had the effect of reducing interest expense for those periods our average invested cash was 15 billion during both fiscal 2012 and 2011 despite the similar levels of average cash interest income was lower in our current fiscal year due to an increase in the amount of cash held in noninterest bearing cash accounts cash held in these accounts partially offset bank fees 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash we currently expect our interest expense to be lower in fiscal 2013 since we repaid our 392 million of 5 5  8  senior notes in september 2012 

income taxes in fiscal 2012 reflect an effective tax rate of 391 compared to 376 in the prior fiscal year the increase is primarily the result of a valuation allowance recorded on deferred tax assets primarily relating to our canadian drug distribution operations we expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 39 

income from continuing operations of 7082 in fiscal 2012 increased 2 from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income and was offset in part by the increases in interest expense and income taxes diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 276 in fiscal 2012 increased 10 from 251 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 8 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

income from discontinued operations net of income taxes of 108 million and 107 million represents the income of andersonbrecon in both fiscal 2012 and 2011 respectively 

year ended september 30 2011 compared with year ended september 30 2010 

revenue 



revenue of 800 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 29 from the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue was due to the 5 growth of abdc offset in part by the 3 revenue decline of absg 

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

abdcs revenue increased 5 from fiscal 2010 due to overall pharmaceutical market growth and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers primarily our institutional customers 

absgs revenue of 155 billion in fiscal 2011 decreased by 3 from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the september 2010 discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model absgs revenue decline in fiscal 2011 was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis providers and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals 

during both fiscal 2011 and 2010 70 of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 30 was from sales to retail customers sales to institutional customers increased 4 in fiscal 2011 and sales to retail customers increased 1 in fiscal 2011 

other 

other revenue increased 403 million from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the strong performance of the lash group which provides commercialization support services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers 

gross profit 



gross profit of 25 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 1765 million or 76 from fiscal 2010 this increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the impact of certain specialty generic product introductions launches the continued strong growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs and increased contributions from our feeforservice agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers all of the above was offset in part by normal competitive pressures on customer margins oxaliplatin gemcitabine and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were launched in the quarters ended september 30 2009 december 31 2010 and march 31 2011 respectively the gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs in fiscal 2011 was higher than the benefit achieved from oxaliplatin alone in fiscal 2010 by approximately 96 million sales of oxaliplatin the largest contributor of the three specialty generic drugs benefited our gross profit by approximately 106 million and 117 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively beginning in our fourth quarter ended september 30 2011 the gross profit contributions from the sales gemcitabine and docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined in fiscal 2011 we recognized a gain of 21 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this compared to a recognized gain of 207 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in fiscal 2010 these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold lastly in fiscal 2010 we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us our gross profit benefited by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation 

as a percentage of revenue our gross profit margin of 313 in fiscal 2011 improved by 14 basis points from fiscal 2010 due to the abovementioned generic oncology drug launches the strong growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs and increased contributions from feeforservice agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers who benefit from our best pricing and normal competitive pressures on customer margins additionally the gain on antitrust litigation settlements as noted above contributed 3 basis points to our gross margin in fiscal 2010 

we recorded a lifo charge of 347 million and 302 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

operating expenses 



in fiscal 2011 we started to incur significant costs to support our new erp system as we began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new erp system additionally in fiscal 2011 abdc implemented its energiz program which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity improve customer contractual compliance and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations 

distribution selling and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 25 due to incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms and an increase in consulting expenses related to abdcs energiz program in fiscal 2010 asset impairment charges included a writeoff of capitalized software of 67 million which was included within distribution selling and administrative expenses 

depreciation expense increased from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the implementation of our new erp system 

employee severance litigation and other in fiscal 2011 included 44 million related to our energiz program a 160 million charge related to the preliminary qui tam settlement the qui tam matter as described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and 32 million of costs related to business acquisitions fiscal 2010 benefited from the reversal of a 44 million legal accrual 

as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 164 in fiscal 2011 an increase of 5 basis points from fiscal 2010 this increase was due to the same matters as noted above and was offset in part by our operating leverage particularly within abdc 

operating income 



segment operating income is evaluated before employee severance litigation and other 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income increased 1307 million from fiscal 2010 due to the increase in its gross profit offset in part by an increase in its operating expenses 

other operating income in fiscal 2011 decreased 77 million primarily due to a 65 million intangible asset impairment charge 

the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the costs relating to employee severance litigation and other and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 4 basis points in fiscal 2011 and increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2010 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were as follows in thousands 



interest expense in fiscal 2011 increased from fiscal 2010 due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project interest costs capitalized had the effect of reducing interest expense and were 34 million and 66 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively interest income decreased from fiscal 2010 primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in noninterest bearing cash accounts 

income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect an effective income tax rate of 376 compared to 380 in fiscal 2010 the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes 

income from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 increased 11 from fiscal 2010 primarily due to the increase in operating income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 251 in fiscal 2011 increased 15 from 219 in fiscal 2010 the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 3 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase programs see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

income from discontinued operations net of income taxes represented the income from andersonbrecon in both fiscal 2011 and 2010 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and managements judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2012 2011 and 2010 was 255 million 392 million and 431 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2012 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 40 million 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2012 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 96 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 79 and 81 of our inventories at september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout lifo method if we had used the firstin firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 2567 million and 2560 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2012 and 2011 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 07 million 347 million and 302 million in fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 respectively 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company including the fair value of any contingent consideration is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships software technology and noncompete agreements are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit andor the component of the entity being valued we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value impairment indicators this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 2011 and 2010 and as a result recorded 65 million and 25 million of impairment charges in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option expected volatility riskfree interest rate dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect managements assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 116 million in fiscal 2012 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2012 including availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 



along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our multicurrency revolving credit facility and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 

in february 2012 we repaid the borrowings under the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility which was terminated in september 2012 we repaid the borrowings under the 3923 million 5 5  8  senior notes due september 15 2012 

in november 2011 we issued 500 million of 3 1  2  senior notes due november 15 2021 the 2021 notes the 2021 notes were sold at 99858 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 352 interest on the 2021 notes is payable semiannually in arrears commencing may 15 2012 the 2021 notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility the 2015 notes and the 2019 notes all defined below we used the net proceeds of the 2021 notes for general corporate purposes costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2021 notes were deferred and are being amortized over the tenyear term of the notes 

we have a 700 million multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in march 2015 the multicurrency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders in october 2011 we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the multicurrency revolving credit facility to october 2016 the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates and facility fees in november 2012 we further extended the maturity date to november 2017 interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable 90 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee at september 30 2012 additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points annually of the total commitment 10 basis points at september 30 2012 we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test as well as others that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales which we are compliant with as of september 30 2012 

on october 31 2011 we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue shortterm promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to 700 million at any one time amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed from time to time the maturities on the notes will vary but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance the notes will bear interest rates if interest bearing or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts the commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our multicurrency revolving credit facility there were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program at september 30 2012 

we have a 700 million receivables securitization facility receivables securitization facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2014 in october 2011 we entered into an amendment to the receivables securitization facility to extend the maturity date to october 2014 the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates in november 2012 we further extended the maturity date to november 2015 we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee of 75 basis points we currently pay an unused fee of 375 basis points annually to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility at september 30 2012 there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 

we have 500 million of 5 7  8  senior notes due september 15 2015 the 2015 notes and 400 million of 4 7  8  senior notes due november 15 2019 the 2019 notes the 2015 notes were sold at 995 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 594 the 2019 notes were sold in november 2009 at 99174 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 498 interest on the 2015 notes and the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears all of the senior notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility all of the senior notes and the multicurrency revolving credit facility were previously guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of the companys subsidiaries which were known as the guarantor subsidiaries on june 29 2012 in accordance with the terms of the documents governing the underlying obligations each of the guarantor subsidiaries was released from its obligations under its guarantee of the senior notes and the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the repayment of debt fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities in august 2011 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions during fiscal 2012 we purchased 5000 million of our common stock to complete our availability remaining on this 750 million share repurchase program additionally we paid 80 million in october 2011 to settle purchases of our common stock made on september 29 2011 on may 10 2012 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million shares of our common stock subject to market conditions during fiscal 2012 we purchased 6531 million of our common stock under this 750 million share repurchase program as of september 30 2012 we had 969 million of availability remaining on the 750 million share repurchase program on november 1 2012 our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million shares of our common stock subject to market conditions we currently expect to purchase at least 200 million of our common stock in fiscal 2013 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2012 in thousands 



we have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through the 20142015 flu season we are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately 764 million as of september 30 2012 of which 387 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2013 these influenza vaccine commitments are included in other commitments in the above table 

we have commitments to purchase blood plasma products from suppliers through december 31 2012 we are required to purchase quantities at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately 248 million as of september 30 2012 these commitments are included in other commitments in the above table

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 433 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2012 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table 

during fiscal 2012 our operating activities provided 13054 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 11679 million in the prior fiscal year cash provided by operations in fiscal 2012 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 7082 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 4206 million and noncash items of 2610 million offset in part by an increase in merchandise inventories of 2001 million noncash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of 606 million which represented a 1333 million decline from the prior fiscal year deferred income taxes were significantly higher in the prior year period due to the larger income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our business transformation capital expenditures the 4206 million increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the timing of inventory purchases made and the related payments to our suppliers merchandise inventories increased 2001 million from the september 30 2011 balance due to the timing of inventory purchases 

we use days sales outstanding days inventory on hand and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance we expect our days sales outstanding in fiscal 2013 to increase slightly as the payment terms in our new threeyear contract with express scripts are longer than the payment terms in the previous medco contract

market risk 

our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2012 we had 508 million of variable rate debt outstanding the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2012 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 11 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2012 of which 2300 million was invested in money market accounts at financial institutions the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar the uk pound sterling and the euro we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates such contracts generally have durations of less than one year we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september 30 2012 we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no 201105 comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income asu no 201105 requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements asu no 201105 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and early adoption is permitted we are evaluating our presentation options under asu no 201105 however we do not expect adoption of this guidance to impact our consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation we intend to adopt this asu in our quarter ending december 31 2012 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment under asu no 201108 an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the entity determines that this threshold is not met then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary asu no 201108 is effective for fiscal years that begin after december 15 2011 and early adoption is permitted we intend to adopt this asu in our fiscal year beginning october 1 2012 

in july 2012 the fasb issued asu no 201202 intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment asu no 201202 simplifies how an entity tests indefinitelived intangible assets other than goodwill for impairment by providing entities with an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary an entity would continue to calculate the fair value of an indefinitelived intangible asset if the asset fails the qualitative assessment while no further analysis would be required if it passes asu no 201202 is effective for annual and interim indefinitelived intangible asset impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after september 15 2012 and early adoption is permitted we intend to adopt this asu in our fiscal year beginning october 1 2012

as used herein the terms “company” “amerisourcebergen” “we” “us” or “our” refer to amerisourcebergen corporation a delaware corporation 

amerisourcebergen corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies with operations primarily in the united states and canada servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel we provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers primarily located in the united states and canada including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical and dialysis clinics physicians and physician group practices longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers we also provide pharmacy services to certain specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmaceutical packaging pharmacy automation inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and pharmacy management 

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc “ims” an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow annually between 0 and 3 through 2015 ims expects that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population the number of individuals age 55 and over in the united states currently exceeds 75 million and is one of the most rapidly growing segments of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately 75 of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a significant number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years we expect over 30 brand to generic conversions during the next twelve months in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth 

increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates more recently in march 2010 the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which would increase the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details

operations 

operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2011 are comprised of one reportable segment pharmaceutical distribution 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment represents the consolidated operating results of the company and is comprised of four operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” amerisourcebergen consulting services “abcs” and amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes prior to fiscal 2011 the business operations of abcs were included within absg 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 

absg through a number of operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines additionally absg provides third party logistics and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers 

  3 

abcs through a number of operating businesses provides commercialization support services including reimbursement support programs outcomes research contract field staffing patient assistance and copay assistance programs adherence programs risk mitigation services and other market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers 

abpg consists of american health packaging anderson packaging “anderson” and brecon pharmaceuticals limited “brecon” american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers american health packaging’s largest customer is abdc and as a result its operations are closely aligned with the operations of abdc anderson and brecon based in the united kingdom are leading providers of contract packaging and also provide clinical trials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers beginning in fiscal 2012 to increase our operating efficiencies and to better align our operations each business unit within abpg will be combined with abdc or abcs more specifically the operations of american health packaging will be combined with the abdc operating segment and the operations of anderson and brecon will be combined with the abcs operating segment 

sales and marketing the majority of abdc’s sales force is organized regionally and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdc’s national marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdc’s sales and marketing organization also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our other operating segments each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings in addition we have a corporate marketing group that coordinates branding and other marketing activities across the company 

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physicians and physician group practices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers in fiscal 2011 total revenue was comprised of 71 institutional customers and 29 retail customers 

in fiscal 2011 medco health solutions inc our largest customer accounted for 19 of our revenue our next largest customer accounted for 55 of our fiscal 2011 revenue our top 10 customers represented approximately 43 of fiscal 2011 revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2011 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2011 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2011 accounted for approximately 51 of our purchases 

information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized system abdc’s operating system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing third party claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc has a warehouse operating system which is used to account for the majority of abdc’s transactional volume the warehouse operating system has improved abdc’s productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

  4 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services and other third party service providers 

in an effort to continue to make system investments to further improve our information technology capabilities and meet our future customer and operational needs we began to make significant investments in fiscal 2008 relating to our business transformation project that includes a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system the erp system will include the development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance our business practices and lower costs effective october 2010 the majority of our corporate and administrative functions began operating on our new erp system additionally in fiscal 2011 two of our abdc distribution facilities implemented and began using passport our new webbased customer facing application with enhanced ordering and product catalog features we expect to continue the implementation of the erp system including passport and as a result expect to continue to make significant investments in our business transformation project 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest national competitors are cardinal health inc “cardinal” and mckesson corporation “mckesson” abdc competes with both cardinal and mckesson as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absg’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc express scripts inc and ups logistics among others our consulting and packaging businesses also face competition from a variety of competitors in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2011 we had approximately 10300 employees of which approximately 9400 were fulltime employees approximately 45 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

  5 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including federal antikickback statutes the antikickback statutes prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 these and other requirements are expected to increase the cost of our operations 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006 these fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase our costs andor burden of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies to secure the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier “sni” which would be coded into the data carrier applied by the manufacturer in march 2010 the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fda’s development and implementation of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain 

federal legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of their prescription drug costs the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid in addition the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to no less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see “risk factors” below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition

health information practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and its accompanying federal regulations set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information in addition our operations depending on their location may be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

enacted in 2009 the american recovery and reinvestment act “arra” strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect personallyidentifiable health information including by imposing new notification requirements related to health data security breaches the arra also provides incentive payments to eligible healthcare providers participating in medicare and medicaid programs that adopt certified electronic health record “her” technology the electronic prescribing erx incentive program provides incentives for eligible healthcare providers who are successful electronic prescribers beginning in 2012 eligible providers who are not successful electronic prescribers may be subject to a reduction in their medicare physician fee schedule payments unless they receive a significant hardship exemption there can be no assurances that compliance with the new privacy requirements and compliance with ehr standards will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a   risk factors 

tableend 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals cardinal and mckesson regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals national generic distributors chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies see “competition” competition continues to increase in specialty distribution and services where gross margins historically have been higher than in abdc reflecting that increased competition our two national competitors have recently completed acquisitions to expand their footprint in the area of specialty distribution and services if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result approximately 8 of our gross profit from brandname manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price increases slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

despite our recent success amending our multicurrency revolving credit facility amending our receivables securitization facility and issuing 500 million of tenyear senior notes in recent years the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption for example in the latter half of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009 the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength if the markets return to the levels of disruption and volatility experienced in the latter half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

  8 

our revenue results of operations and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

our largest customer medco health solutions inc accounted for 19 of our revenue in fiscal 2011 our top ten customers represented approximately 43 of fiscal 2011 revenue in july 2011 medco announced its intention to merge with express scripts inc which will be the surviving corporation and is a customer of one of our competitors our business with medco contributes approximately 5 of our earnings our current contract with medco continues at least through march 2013 we will make every effort to extend our relationship with the combined entity upon the expiration of our current contract however if we fail to do so our revenue earnings and cash flows would be significantly impacted we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2011 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue results of operations and cash flows 

our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2011 our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 11 and 10 of accounts receivable net 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies 

in recent years some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create electronic pedigrees which will be effective for us in july 2016 in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays 

at the federal level final regulations issued pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act became effective in december 2006 the fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace andor authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the sellable units and cases the fda is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier “sni” in march 2010 fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in which the fda identified packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fda’s development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

  9 

the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by the dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers’ licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

in 2007 our orlando florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals was suspended and later reinstated under an agreement with the dea when we implemented an enhanced and more sophisticated ordermonitoring program in all of our abdc distribution centers in addition in 2008 one of our subsidiaries bellco drug corp received a new dea registration following the suspension of its license and entry into a consent judgment with the dea prior to our acquisition of the business while we expect to continue to comply with all of the dea’s requirements there can be no assurance that the dea will not require further controls against the diversion of controlled substances in the future or will not take similar action against any other of our distribution centers in the future 

legal regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and our customers’ businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined 

federal legislation known as the affordable care act became law in march 2010 the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of prescription drug costs the affordable care act contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of medicare and medicaid while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our operations 

the affordable care act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less than 175 of the weighted average manufacturer price “amp” the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” have released for review and comment a draft federal upper limit methodology and draft federal upper limits determined by using that methodology while the draft federal upper limit prices released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits currently in place the impact of the cms methodology cannot be determined until finalized any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and make other changes affecting medicaid rebate amounts the affordable care act’s redefinition of amp is expected to result in most instances in a higher amp this higher amp coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business the federal government could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

in february 2011 the federal department of health and human services “hhs” announced that it would be conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average actual pharmacy acquisition costs the results of which states may use to determine statespecific pharmaceutical reimbursement rates there can be no assurances that state pharmaceutical rates derived from this new data will not result in lower medicaid reimbursement levels that could adversely impact our business

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and more conservative guidelines for recommended dosage and use any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues in addition on january 1 2011 cms began implementing a prospective payment system for medicare endstage renal disease esrd services that provides a single bundled payment to dialysis facilities covering most esrd services including anemia drugs there is a 4year transition period to the new prospective payment system we cannot at this time assess the impact this new payment system when fully implemented will have on our business our sales of anemia drugs including those used in oncology represented approximately 4 of revenue in fiscal 2011 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the medicare part d program the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability there have been additional changes to the part d program since its enactment notably the affordable care act provides additional assistance to beneficiaries who reach the part d “coverage gap” including a manufacturer discount program mandates additional medication therapy management services and reduces part d subsidies for certain highincome beneficiaries cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities for instance the budget control act of 2011 established a congressional committee charged with identifying 15 trillion in deficit reduction provisions which could include reductions in medicare andor medicaid spending if legislation meeting deficit reduction targets is not adopted by january 2012 a total of 12 trillion in spending reductions affecting a variety of programs would automatically go into effect in january 2013 reductions in payments to medicare providers under this process would be capped at 2 while medicaid would be exempt from such reductions any future reductions in medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers’ businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare andor medicaid payment or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors 

absg sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and provides a number of services to or through physicians drugs that are administered in a physician’s office such as drugs that are infused or injected are typically covered under medicare part b declining reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs and other economic factors have caused a number of physician practices including some customers to move from private practice to hospital settings where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like absg this trend may continue due to various factors including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how cms calculates average sales price “asp” for medicare part b drugs because medicare currently reimburses physicians for part b drugs at the rate of asp plus six percent changes in asp have reduced and could continue to reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs these reductions could accelerate the trend of physician practices moving to or being acquired by hospitals and could also indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in corresponding declines in absg’s profitability in addition deficit reduction measures pursuant to the budget control act of 2011 could include reductions in medicare spending such as lower reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs any future reductions in the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under medicare part b could negatively impact our customers’ businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us at this time we can provide no assurances that future medicare reimbursement or policy changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

  11 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

the enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in canada including the profitability of that business 

consistent with our operations in the united states our products and services function within the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in canada the purchase of pharmaceutical products in canada is funded in part by the provincial governments which each regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently in recent years like the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending for example in 2006 the ontario government enacted the transparent drug system for patients act which significantly revised the drug distribution system in ontario on july 1 2010 the ontario government finalized regulatory changes to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs in ontario to reduce costs for taxpayers these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals in both the public governmentsponsored plans and private markets and the elimination of professional allowances paid to pharmacists changes in generic drug prices also affect the cash values of the percentage markups that may be charged by pharmacies these reforms may result in lower service fees cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services in addition any fees based on percentage of drug prices will be reduced by any reductions to generic drug prices themselves legislation andor regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well the legislative changes in ontario had an immediate impact on quebec because it requires manufacturers to sell pharmaceuticals to quebec at the lowest price in canada the governments of alberta and british columbia have also taken steps to reduce the prices for generic drugs listed on their formularies we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability in canada revenue from our canadian operations in fiscal 2011 was less than 2 of our consolidated revenue 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a relator to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale andor purchase of branded pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale andor purchase of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

  12 

on october 24 2011 we announced that we had reached a preliminary agreement for a civil settlement the “preliminary settlement” with the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the plaintiff states and the relator collectively the “plaintiffs” of the claims in a civil case that was filed in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the “district of massachusetts case” under the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil false claims acts against two business units of the company which are subsidiaries of amerisourcebergen specialty group international nephrology network “inn” a group purchasing organization for nephrologists and nephrology practices and asd specialty healthcare inc “asd” which is a distributor of pharmaceuticals to physician practices the relator was a former employee of amgen inc which was also a defendant in the case the civil case was administratively closed after the preliminary settlement was reached the preliminary settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement agreement with the plaintiffs which we expect to finalize in fiscal year 2012 we do not expect inn or asd to admit any liability in connection with the settlement we recorded a 16 million charge in fiscal 2011 in connection with the preliminary settlement the matter is described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

in addition we have learned that there are prior and subsequent filings in one or more federal district courts including a complaint filed by one of our former employees that are under seal and involve allegations against the company andor subsidiaries or businesses of the company including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business similar to those raised in the district of massachusetts case the preliminary settlement encompasses resolution of one of these other filings with regard to any of these filings not encompassed by the preliminary settlement our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if government authorities decide to intervene in any such pending cases andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such pending cases 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not properly estimated the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

we have pharmaceutical distribution operations based in canada and provide contract packaging and clinical trials materials services in the united kingdom we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties 

information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks a failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems or those of our third party service providers as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs andor cause losses as a result cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for us although we believe that we have robust information security procedures and other safeguards in place as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures andor to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities 

  13 

third party service providers are responsible for managing a significant portion of our information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

we have begun to implement an erp system which when completed will handle the business and financial processes within abdc’s operations and our corporate and administrative functions such as i facilitating the purchase and distribution of inventory items from our distribution centers ii receiving processing and shipping orders on a timely basis iii managing the accuracy of billings and collections for our customers iv processing payments to our suppliers and v generating financial transactions and information erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect 

additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems our ability to produce financial reports andor the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and the united kingdom as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of certain foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

pharmaceutical distribution 

our operations are comprised of one reportable segment pharmaceutical distribution the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment represents the consolidated operating results of the company and is comprised of four operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” amerisourcebergen consulting services “abcs” and amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes prior to fiscal 2011 the business operations of abcs were included within absg

amerisourcebergen corporation summary financial information 

 

year ended september 30 2011 compared with year ended september 30 2010 

operating results 

revenue of 802 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 29 from the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue was due to the 5 growth of abdc offset in part by the 3 revenue decline of absg during fiscal 2011 71 of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 29 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2010 of 70 institutional and 30 retail sales to institutional customers increased 4 in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased 1 in the current fiscal year 

abdc’s revenue increased 5 from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers primarily our institutional customers 

absg’s revenue of 155 billion in fiscal 2011 decreased by 3 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the september 2010 discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model absg’s revenue decline in the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis providers and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues

we currently expect our revenue growth in fiscal 2012 to be relatively flat or to grow modestly in comparison to fiscal 2011 we expect a significant number of brand to generic drug conversions in fiscal 2012 and one of our larger retail customers the former long’s drugs with annual revenue totaling 2 billion was previously acquired by a customer of one of our competitors and did not renew its contract as a result we will no longer service this large customer after september 30 2011 our expected growth reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization the introduction of new products and higher branded pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics our growth also may be impacted among other things by industry competition and changes in customer mix in july 2011 our largest customer medco health solutions inc “medco” which accounted for 19 of our revenue in fiscal 2011 announced its intention to merge with express scripts inc which will be the surviving corporation and is a customer of one of our competitors our business with medco contributes approximately 5 of our earnings our current contract with medco continues at least through march 2013 we will make every effort to extend our relationship with the combined entity upon the expiration of our current contract however if we fail to do so our revenue earnings and cash flows would be significantly impacted our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

gross profit of 25 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 1825 million or 77 from the prior fiscal year the increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the specialty generic product introductions launches the continued strong growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs and increased contributions from our feeforservice agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers all of the above was offset in part by normal competitive pressures on customer margins oxaliplatin gemcitabine and docetaxel all generic oncology drugs were launched in the quarters ended september 30 2009 december 31 2010 and march 31 2011 respectively the gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs in the fiscal year ended september 30 2011 was higher than the benefit achieved from oxaliplatin alone in the prior fiscal year by approximately 96 million sales of oxaliplatin the largest contributor of the three specialty generic drugs benefited our gross profit by approximately 106 million and 117 million in the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively we fully depleted our inventory of this product in fiscal 2011 further quantities of oxaliplatin are not expected to be available until the product is relaunched in august 2012 beginning in our fourth quarter ended september 30 2011 the gross profit contributions from sales of gemcitabine and docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined additionally we expect the gross profit contributions from the sales of gemcitabine and docetaxel to be significantly lower in fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011 in fiscal 2012 we expect the gross profit decline from the abovementioned three specialty generic products will be substantially offset by the expected gross profit contribution from the over 30 abdc brand to generic product conversions that are anticipated to occur however there are unique circumstances surrounding the launch of each generic product and the actual gross profit from these launches can differ materially from what we expect in the current fiscal year we recognized a gain of 21 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this compared to a recognized gain of 207 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers in the prior fiscal year these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold we are unable to estimate future gains if any that we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note 13 of the notes to consolidated financial statements lastly in fiscal 2010 we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us our gross profit benefited by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation 

as a percentage of revenue our gross profit margin of 317 in fiscal 2011 improved 15 basis points from the prior fiscal year the gross profit margin improvement was due to the abovementioned generic oncology drug launches the strong growth and profitability of our nonspecialty generic programs and increased contributions from our feeforservice agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers who benefit from our best pricing and normal competitive pressures on customer margins additionally the gain on antitrust litigation settlements as noted above contributed 2 basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal 2010 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 347 million and 302 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively 

in fiscal 2011 we started to incur significant costs to support our new erp system as we began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new erp system the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms including depreciation are estimated to be 40 million per year during the transition period additionally in fiscal 2011 abdc implemented its energiz program which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity improve customer contractual compliance and drive efficiency by linking our information technology capabilities more effectively with our operations 

  23 

operating expenses of 13 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 833 million or 67 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms including depreciation an increase in consulting expenses related to abdc’s energiz program and an increase in employee severance litigation and other costs in fiscal 2011 we incurred severance costs of 44 million related to our energiz program we recorded a 160 million charge related to the preliminary qui tam settlement the qui tam matter as described in note 12 “legal matters and contingencies” of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we incurred 32 million of costs related to business acquisitions and we incurred a 65 million charge related to intangible asset impairments in the prior fiscal year asset impairment charges included a writeoff of capitalized software of 67 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses and intangible asset impairment charges of 32 million additionally the prior fiscal year benefited from the reversal of a 44 million legal accrual as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 167 in fiscal 2011 and increased by 6 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the same matters as noted above and was offset in part by our operating leverage particularly within abdc 

operating income of 12 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 991 million or 90 from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit as a percentage of revenue operating income increased 8 basis points to 150 in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in our gross profit margin offset in part by the increase in our operating expense margin 

the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the costs relating to employee severance litigation and other and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2011 and increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010 

other income of 46 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to a gain resulting from payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business disposition other loss of 34 million in fiscal 2010 primarily related to a loss incurred on an equity investment 

interest expense interest income and the respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2011 and 2010 were as follows in thousands 

 

interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project interest costs capitalized have the effect of reducing interest expense and were 34 million and 66 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010 respectively interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in noninterest bearing cash accounts 

our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash we expect our interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal 2012 primarily due to the november 2011 issuance of our 3 1  2  senior notes due 2021 as described further within liquidity and capital resources 

income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect an effective tax rate of 375 compared to 380 in the prior fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes we continue to expect that our ongoing effective tax rate will be approximately 384 

  24 

net income of 7066 million in fiscal 2011 increased 110 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income diluted earnings per share of 254 in fiscal 2011 increased 144 from 222 in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in net income was primarily due to the 3 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase programs as described within liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

year ended september 30 2010 compared with year ended september 30 2009 

operating results 

revenue of 780 billion in fiscal 2010 which included bulk deliveries to customer warehouses increased 86 from the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue was due to the 10 growth of abdc and the 5 growth of absg during fiscal 2010 70 of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 30 was sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2009 of 69 institutional and 31 retail sales to institutional customers increased 10 in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased 6 in the current fiscal year 

abdc’s revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by 10 from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth revenue from our new customers primarily new buying group customers with which we started doing business in march and april of 2009 and a new alternate site customer which we added in august 2009 collectively representing approximately 4 of abdc’s revenue growth in fiscal 2010 and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers 

absg’s revenue in fiscal 2010 of 160 billion increased 5 from the prior fiscal year due to growth of its distribution businesses primarily relating to the distribution of nephrology and blood products and its third party logistics business the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology 

gross profit of 24 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by 2566 million or 12 from the prior fiscal year this increase was in large part attributable to our revenue growth the continued strong growth and profitability of our generic programs with generic revenue increasing by 17 in comparison to the prior fiscal year and increased contributions from feeforservice agreements with brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers in august 2009 a generic oncology drug oxaliplatin was introduced launched and absg’s gross profit significantly benefited from this generic launch in fiscal 2010 the gross profit benefit that we received from this generic launch significantly exceeded the typical benefit we have experienced in the past from generic launches approximately onethird of the gross profit increase for fiscal 2010 was derived from this new generic product launch additionally in fiscal 2010 we recognized a gain of 207 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this gain was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold lastly in fiscal 2010 we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us our gross profit benefited by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation 

as a percentage of revenue our gross profit margin of 302 in fiscal 2010 improved by 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the strong growth and profitability of our generic programs including new and recent generic launches and increased contributions from feeforservice agreements with brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers additionally the gain on antitrust litigation settlements as noted above had the effect of increasing our gross profit margin by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010 all of these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers who benefit from our best pricing and normal competitive pressures on customer margins 

we recorded a lifo charge of 302 million and 151 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in our lifo charge reflects strong brandname price inflation and a yearoveryear reduction in generic price deflation 

  25 

operating expenses of 13 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by 367 million or 3 from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in bad debt expense of 113 million primarily relating to physician customers within absg’s oncology business an increase in incentive compensation an increase in depreciation and amortization of 76 million and additional expenses incurred relating to our business transformation project which includes a new enterprise resource planning “erp” system the above increases were offset in part by a 99 million reduction in employee severance litigation and other costs and a 47 million reduction in asset impairment charges asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included a writeoff of capitalized software of 67 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses and intangible asset impairment charges of 32 million asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included intangible asset impairment charges of 118 million and the writeoff of capitalized software of 28 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 161 in fiscal 2010 and represented a significant 8 basis point decline in our operating expense ratio from the prior fiscal year reflecting our strong operating leverage particularly within abdc as its operating expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2010 in comparison to the prior fiscal year despite its 10 revenue growth our operating leverage has benefited from significant productivity increases achieved from our highly automated distribution facilities and our ce2 initiative as described below 

in july 2010 and october 2010 we implemented the first and second phases of our new erp system as a result we started to depreciate a significant portion of our capitalized project costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 additionally we started to incur other significant costs to support our new erp system as we began the transition from our legacy information systems to our erp system 

in fiscal 2008 we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative “ce2” designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness in connection with these efforts we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions in fiscal 2009 we terminated 197 employees and incurred 31 million of employee severance costs relating to our ce2 initiative additionally in fiscal 2009 we recorded 22 million of expense to increase our liability relating to a former executive employee matter in fiscal 2010 we reversed our remaining 44 million liability relating to this matter 

operating income of 11 billion in fiscal 2010 increased 2199 million or 25 from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit as a percentage of revenue operating income increased 19 basis points to 142 in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in our gross profit margin and the decrease in our operating expense ratio 

the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the benefit from employee severance litigation and other and the intangible asset impairments increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2010 the costs of employee severance litigation and other and the intangible asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2009 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were as follows in thousands 

 

interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 1832 million in average borrowings offset in part by an increase in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project and a decrease in the weighted average variable interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to 171 from 208 in the prior fiscal year interest costs capitalized in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 66 million and 29 million respectively interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate offset in part by an increase in average invested cash of 5783 million 

average borrowings increased in fiscal 2010 resulting from the november 2009 issuance of 400 million of tenyear senior notes offset in part by the repayment of substantially all amounts then outstanding under our multicurrency revolving credit facility both described in liquidity and capital resources 

  26 

income taxes in fiscal 2010 reflect an effective income tax rate of 380 compared to 379 in the prior fiscal year due to the impact of discrete tax events we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal 2010 and 2009 thereby reducing our effective tax rate from a normalized 384 

income from continuing operations of 6367 million in fiscal 2010 increased 24 from 5119 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 222 in fiscal 2010 increased 31 from 169 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 5 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers’ financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2011 2010 and 2009 was 393 million 431 million and 318 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2011 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 39 million 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2011 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 92 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

  27 

loss contingencies 

an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 80 and 78 of our inventories at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if we had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 2560 million and 2213 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2011 and 2010 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 347 million 302 million and 151 million in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 respectively 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements patents and software technology are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit andor the component of the entity being valued we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value “impairment indicators” this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management 

we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 and as a result recorded 65 million 25 million and 16 million of impairment charges respectively in fiscal 2009 due to the existence of impairment indicators at us bioservices a specialty pharmacy company within our specialty group we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy’s trade name as of june 30 2009 which resulted in an impairment charge of 89 million our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option future volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

  28 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 113 million in fiscal 2011 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2011 including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 

 

along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 

  29 

in november 2011 we issued 500 million of 3 1  2  senior notes due november 15 2021 the “2021 notes” the 2021 notes were sold at 99858 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 352 interest on the 2021 notes is payable semiannually in arrears commencing may 15 2012 the 2021 notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility and the 2012 notes the 2015 notes and the 2019 notes all defined below we will use the net proceeds of the 2021 notes for general corporate purposes costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2021 notes will be deferred and amortized over the tenyear term of the notes 

we have a 700 million multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in march 2015 the “multicurrency revolving credit facility” with a syndicate of lenders in october 2011 we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the multicurrency revolving credit facility to october 2016 the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates and facility fees interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable currently 90 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate we pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points annually of the total commitment currently 10 basis points we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test as well as others that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales 

on october 31 2011 we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue shortterm promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to 700 million at any one time amounts available under the program may be borrowed repaid and reborrowed from time to time the maturities on the notes will vary but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance the notes will bear interest rates if interest bearing or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts the commercial paper program is fully backed by our multicurrency revolving credit facility 

we have a 700 million receivables securitization facility “receivables securitization facility” which was scheduled to expire in april 2014 in october 2011 we entered into an amendment to the receivables securitization facility to extend the maturity date to october 2014 the amendment also reduced our borrowing rates we have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee of 75 basis points we currently pay an unused fee of 375 basis points annually to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility at september 30 2011 there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 

in april 2011 we amended the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility the “blanco credit facility” to extend the maturity date to april 2012 borrowings under the blanco credit facility are guaranteed by us interest on borrowings under this facility accrues at 100 basis points over libor the blanco credit facility is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2011 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

we have 3923 million of 5 58 senior notes due september 15 2012 the “2012 notes” 500 million of 5 78 senior notes due september 15 2015 the “2015 notes” and 400 million of 4 78 senior notes due november 15 2019 the “2019 notes” the 2012 notes and 2015 notes each were sold at 995 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 571 and 594 respectively the 2019 notes were sold in november 2009 at 99174 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 498 interest on the 2012 notes the 2015 notes and the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears all of the senior notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

  30 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore could reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures including our business transformation project which involves the implementation of our new erp system and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities in august 2011 our board of directors approved a new program allowing us to purchase up to 750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions in september 2010 and november 2009 our board of directors approved programs allowing us to purchase up to 500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions we purchased 8481 million of our common stock in fiscal 2011 of which 981 million was purchased to close out our november 2009 share repurchase program 5000 was purchased to close out our september 2010 share repurchase program and 2500 million was purchased under the august 2011 share repurchase program as of september 30 2011 we had 5000 million of availability remaining on the august 2011 share repurchase program we currently expect to purchase approximately 4000 million of our common stock in fiscal 2012 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2011 in thousands 

 

the 55 million blanco credit facility which expires in april 2012 is included in the “within 1 year” column in the above table however this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2011 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

we have commitments to purchase blood plasma products from suppliers through december 31 2012 we are required to purchase quantities at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately 1212 million as of september 30 2011 of which 957 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2012 these commitments are included in “other commitments” in the above table 

we have outsourced to ibm global services “ibm” a significant portion of our corporate and abdc information technology activities including assistance with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning “erp” system the remaining commitment under our 10year arrangement as amended which expires in june 2015 is approximately 1286 million as of september 30 2011 of which 394 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2012 and is included in “other commitments” in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 457 million including interest and penalties as of september 30 2011 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table

during fiscal 2011 our operating activities provided 11679 million of cash in comparison to cash provided of 11086 million in the prior fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011 was principally the result of net income of 7066 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 4064 million and noncash items of 3940 million offset in part by an increase in merchandise inventories of 2723 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 355 million noncash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of 1950 million which represents an increase of 1095 million from the prior fiscal year and is primarily attributable to income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our business transformation capital expenditures significant tax bonus depreciation is not expected to be available to us in our fiscal year ending september 30 2012 our inventory and accounts payable balances at september 30 2011 were 5 and 4 higher respectively than those balances at september 30 2010 these increases were largely attributable to the growth in our business in fiscal 2011 the average number of inventory days on hand in fiscal 2011 decreased to 245 days from 250 days in the prior fiscal year the average number of days payable outstanding in fiscal 2011 decreased to 331 days from 336 days in the prior fiscal year despite the 3 increase in revenue in fiscal 2011 accounts receivable at september 30 2011 was relatively flat when compared to the balance at september 30 2010 this was primarily due to timing of customer payments to us our average number of days sales outstanding during fiscal 2011 and 2010 was consistent at 173 days operating cash uses during fiscal 2011 included 742 million of interest payments and 2146 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

during fiscal 2010 our operating activities provided 11086 million of cash as compared to cash provided of 7838 million in the prior fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2010 was principally the result of net income of 6367 million noncash items of 2800 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 3854 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 612 million offset in part by an increase in merchandise inventories of 2430 million noncash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of 855 million which primarily related to tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories despite the 9 increase in revenue in fiscal 2010 accounts receivable at september 30 2010 decreased by 2 from september 30 2009 as the average number of days sales outstanding during fiscal 2010 decreased by nearly one day to 173 days from the prior fiscal year reflecting improved cash collection efforts favorable customer mix and timing of customer receipts our inventory and accounts payable balances at september 30 2010 were 5 higher and 4 higher respectively than those balances at september 30 2009 these increases were largely attributed to the growth in our business in fiscal 2010 however the increases were lower than our revenue growth in fiscal 2010 because our inventory and accounts payable balances at september 30 2009 were higher than normal as we made inventory purchases of approximately 400 million in the month of september 2009 primarily relating to purchases of the generic oncology drug launched in august 2009 and purchases made in advance of a manufacturer’s temporary plant shutdown in connection with its facility consolidation efforts the average number of inventory days on hand in fiscal 2010 was consistent with the prior fiscal year the number of average days payable outstanding in fiscal 2010 increased to 336 days from 328 days in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers and a change in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals which generally have more favorable payment terms operating cash uses during fiscal 2010 included 638 million in interest payments and 2578 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 were 1680 million 1846 million and 1458 million respectively we currently expect to spend approximately 150 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 2010 and 2009 related principally to our business transformation project which includes a new erp system for our corporate office and for our abdc operations other capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 included abdc purchases of machinery and equipment which were previously sold to financial institutions and leased back by us and other technology initiatives other capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 included various enhancements made to our other business units’ information and customerrelated technology systems

  32 

in november 2008 our board of directors authorized a program allowing the purchase of up to 500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions during fiscal 2009 we purchased 4319 million under this program and during fiscal 2010 we purchased 681 million to complete the program

market risk 

our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2011 we had 769 million of variable rate debt outstanding the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2011 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 18 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2011 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates such contracts generally have durations of less than one year we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september 30 2011 we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

effective october 1 2009 we adopted the applicable sections of accounting standards codification “asc” 805 “business combinations” which provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquired business additionally this asc provides disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination we also adopted certain other applicable sections that address application issues raised on the initial recognition and measurement subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities relating to contingencies from a business combination we expensed acquisition related costs of 32 million in the fourth quarter ended september 30 2011 relating to our completed or pending business combinations 

  33 

in june 2011 the financial accounting standards board “fasb” issued accounting standards update “asu” no 201105 “comprehensive income presentation of comprehensive income” asu no 201105 requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements asu no 201105 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after december 15 2011 and early adoption is permitted we are evaluating our presentation options under asu no 201105 however we do not expect adoption of this guidance to impact our consolidated financial statements other than the change in presentation 

in september 2011 the fasb issued asu no 201108 “intangibles — goodwill and other topic 350 testing goodwill for impairment” under asu no 201108 an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the entity determines that this threshold is not met then performing the twostep impairment test is unnecessary asu no 201108 is effective for fiscal years that begin after december 15 2011 and early adoption is permitted we intend to early adopt this asu in our fiscal year ending september 30 2012

 item 1 business 

as used herein the terms “company” “amerisourcebergen” “we” “us” or “our” refer to amerisourcebergen corporation a delaware corporation 

amerisourcebergen corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies with operations primarily in the united states and canada servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel we provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers primarily located in the united states and canada including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical and dialysis clinics physicians and physician group practices longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers we also provide pharmacy services to certain specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmaceutical packaging pharmacy automation inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and pharmacy management 

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc “ims” an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow between 3 and 5 in calendar 2011 ims expects that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market additionally ims expects the us pharmaceutical industry to grow annually between 2 and 5 through 2014 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population the number of individuals age 55 and over in the united states currently exceeds 70 million and is one of the most rapidly growing segments of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately 75 of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals a significant number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth 

increased use of drug therapies in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates more recently in march 2010 the united states congress enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance which would increase the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs the health reform law provides for sweeping changes to medicare and medicaid policies including drug reimbursement policies expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 6 for further details

our specialty service businesses help pharmaceutical manufacturers especially in the biotechnology sector commercialize their products in the channel we believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies to launch drugs with targeted populations and support the products in the supply channel we also provide third party logistics nursing services and specialty pharmacy services to help speed products to market 

our acquisition of bellco in fiscal 2008 allowed us to significantly increase our sales of pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics we continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in specialty distribution and services 

 

in october 2008 we sold pmsi our workers’ compensation business 

in 2007 the company and kindred healthcare inc “kindred” completed the spinoffs and subsequent combination of their institutional pharmacy businesses pharmerica longterm care “longterm care” and kindred pharmacy services “kps” to form a new independent publicly traded company named pharmerica corporation “pmc” 

operations 

operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2010 are comprised of one reportable segment pharmaceutical distribution 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of three operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” or “specialty group” and amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” or “packaging group” servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 

absg through a number of individual operating businesses provides pharmaceutical distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including dialysis clinics absg also distributes plasma and other blood products injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines in addition through its specialty service businesses absg provides drug commercialization services third party logistics reimbursement consulting data analytics outcomes research and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as practice management and group purchasing services for physician practices beginning in fiscal 2011 certain specialty service businesses within absg will be combined to form the operations of amerisourcebergen consulting services “abcs” these businesses will principally provide drug commercialization services reimbursement consulting data analytics and outcomes research abcs revenue in fiscal 2010 was less than 1 of our consolidated revenue

abpg consists of american health packaging anderson packaging “anderson” and brecon pharmaceuticals limited “brecon” american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers american health packaging’s largest customer is abdc and as a result its operations are closely aligned with the operations of abdc anderson is a leading provider of contract packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers and has recently entered the clinical trials packaging service business brecon is a united kingdombased provider of contract packaging and clinical trials materials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

sales and marketing the majority of abdc’s sales force is organized regionally and specialized by healthcare provider type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdc’s national marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdc’s sales and marketing organization also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our specialty and packaging groups each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings 

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physicians and physician group practices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotech manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers in fiscal 2010 total revenue was comprised of 70 institutional customers and 30 retail customers 

in fiscal 2010 medco health solutions inc our largest customer accounted for 18 of our revenue no other individual customer accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2010 revenue our top ten customers represented approximately 42 of fiscal 2010 revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2010 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2010 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2010 accounted for approximately 50 of our purchases 

information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized system abdc’s operating system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing thirdparty claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc has a new warehouse operating system which is used to account for primarily all of abdc’s transactional volume the new warehouse operating system has improved abdc’s productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and our corporate functions are outsourced to ibm global services

in an effort to continue to make system investments to further improve our information technology capabilities and meet our future customer and operational needs we began to make significant investments in fiscal 2008 relating to our business transformation project that will include a new enterprise resource planning “erp” platform the erp platform will be implemented throughout abdc and our corporate and administrative functions and will include the development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance our business practices and lower costs effective october 2010 the majority of our corporate and administrative functions began operating on our new erp platform we expect to continue the implementation of the erp platform and as a result expect to continue to make significant investments in our business transformation project through 2012 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the past few years absg has enhanced its web capabilities such that a significant amount of orders are initiated via the internet 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest national competitors are cardinal health inc “cardinal” and mckesson corporation “mckesson” abdc competes with both cardinal and mckesson as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absg’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson us oncology inc which has signed an agreement to be acquired by mckesson cardinal fff enterprises henry schein inc express scripts inc covance inc and ups logistics among others in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2010 we had approximately 10000 employees of which approximately 9100 were fulltime employees approximately 4 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

federal and state statutes and regulation 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances are required to hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of applicable laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these laws and regulations we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statutes the antikickback statute and the related regulations prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation absg’s operations and certain aspects of abdc’s operations are particularly subject to these laws and regulations 

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system for example florida has implemented and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by information that allows for the tracking of the drugs back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using electronic pedigrees although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers these and other requirements are expected to increase our cost of operations at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase our costs andor burden of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of certain of the fda pedigree regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the federal court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed this injunction on july 10 2008 in late 2009 the parties filed a joint motion to stay discovery and agreed to an administrative closing of the file to monitor the progress of counterfeit drug enforcement legislation then pending in congress on september 30 2010 the parties filed a joint motion to extend this stay until june 30 2011 because the bill that led to the administrative closing was and currently remains pending in congress either party may reopen the file at any time before june 30 2011 however if no letter application is made to reopen the file by that time the parties may be considered to have abandoned their claims andor defenses in the case we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other technologies the 2007 act requires the fda to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni in march 2010 the fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in this guidance the fda identifies packagelevel snis as an initial step in the fda’s development and implementation of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education and reconciliation act of 2010 collectively known as the “affordable care act” became law the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of their prescription drug costs other provisions of the affordable care act seek to reduce health care spending such as by increasing manufacturer medicaid drug rebates revising the calculation of medicaid drug reimbursements establishing an independent payment advisory board to achieve additional medicare savings and establishing a regulatory pathway for the approval of followon biologicals promoting valuebased purchasing and 

  6 

making other major changes to reimbursement to most types of medicare providers and suppliers in addition the affordable care act makes a number of changes to the medicare part d program including providing for additional subsidies for beneficiaries in the part d “coverage gap” the law requires drug and device manufacturers to disclose their relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals it also requires manufacturers and group purchasing organizations that do business with federal health programs to disclose certain physician ownership and investment interests the affordable care act imposes among many other policy changes significant new fees and excise taxes on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers expands enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse expands comparative effectiveness research and requires testing of health care delivery reforms while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences scrutiny of the healthcare delivery system in the united states can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels this process may result in additional legislation andor regulation governing the delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as additional changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system we cannot predict what additional initiatives if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs burdens andor impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

medicare and medicaid 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the new medicare part d program beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in outpatient prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beneficiaries who participate select from a range of standalone prescription drug plans or medicare advantage managed care plans that include prescription drug coverage along with other medicare services “part d plans” the part d plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies each part d plan negotiates reimbursement for part d drugs with pharmaceutical manufacturers the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability 

the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 “mippa” established timeframes for part d plan payments to pharmacies and longterm care pharmacy submission of claims required more frequent updating by part d plan sponsors of the drug pricing data they use to pay pharmacies modified statutory provisions regarding coverage of certain “protected classes” of drugs limited certain part d sales and marketing activities and made other part d reforms the affordable care act made additional changes to the part d program including among other things providing a 250 payment in 2010 to beneficiaries who reach the part d “coverage gap” the period after a beneficiary reaches the initial coverage limit and before “catastrophic coverage” is triggered in which beneficiaries pay 100 of costs phasing out the coverage gap by 2020 establishing a discount program beginning january 1 2011 under which medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap will have access to manufacturer discounts equal to 50 of the negotiated price of certain branded drugs and biologicals allowing the secretary of health and human services to designate certain categories of drugs as warranting special formulary treatment mandating that part d plan sponsors provide additional medication therapy management services reducing part d subsidies for certain highincome beneficiaries and mandating that plan sponsors use “specific uniform dispensing techniques” when dispensing drugs to longterm care residents to reduce prescription drug waste beginning in 2012 cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules on november 10 2010 cms published a proposed rule to implement several provisions of the affordable care act related to the part d drug program and make other changes to the part d regulations there can be no assurances that changes in the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

with regard to medicaid effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price “amp” on july 17 2007 centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring the secretary of health and human services to provide amp data to the states on a monthly basis and also to disclose through a website accesible to the public amp prices for branded and generic pharmaceuticals in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing certain provisions of the amp rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program the order also enjoined cms from disclosing amp data to states and disclosing the pricing on a website accessible to the public in october 2008 cms issued a separate final rule in which it stated that the federal upper limits will govern in all states unless a state finds that a particular generic drug is not available within that state these payment limits remain unenforced as a result of the 2007 preliminary injunction in addition mippa delayed the adoption of certain provisions of cms’s july 17 2007 rule and prevented cms from publishing amp data before october 1 2009 on november 15 2010 cms published a final rule that withdraws certain 

  7 

provisions of the july 2007 and october 2008 final rules in light of the legal challenges to the rules and the enactment of the affordable care act which includes provisions that redefined “average manufacturer price” and “multiple source drug” and established a new formula for calculating federal upper limits under the affordable care act federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis are set at no less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly amp using a smoothing process any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to among other things increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers increase “additional rebates” for new formulations of certain brand name drugs establish a maximum rebate and extend rebates to the states for drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations the affordable care act’s redefinition of amp is expected to result in most instances in a higher amp this higher amp coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business the federal government also could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement medicaid rebate amounts or medicare reimbursement under the average sales price calculation methodology there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

see “risk factors” below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and its accompanying federal regulations set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information in addition our operations depending on their location may be subject to additional state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

on february 17 2009 president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act “arra” among other things the law further strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect personallyidentifiable health information including new notification requirements related to health data security breaches the arra also provides incentive payments to eligible healthcare providers participating in medicare and medicaid programs that adopt and successfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record ehr technology there can be no assurances that compliance with the new privacy requirements and compliance with ehr standards will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals cardinal and mckesson national generic distributors regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies see “competition” competition continues to increase in specialty distribution and services where gross margins historically have been higher than in abdc reflecting that increased competition recently our two national competitors have announced or completed acquisitions to expand their footprint in the area of specialty distribution and services if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

  8 

our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result approximately 10 of our gross profit from brandname manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of price appreciation if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

the capital and credit markets experienced significant volatility and disruption particularly in the latter half of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009 in some cases the markets produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength if the markets return to the levels of disruption and volatility experienced in the latter half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our receivables securitization facility expires in april 2011 while we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of september 30 2010 we have historically utilized amounts available to us under this facility from time to time to meet our business needs additionally our multicurrency revolving credit facility expires in november 2011 in fiscal 2011 we will seek to renew these facilities at available market rates which may be higher than the rates currently available to us while we believe we will be able to renew these facilities there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 

our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

our largest customer medco health solutions inc accounted for 18 of our revenue in fiscal 2010 our top ten customers represented approximately 42 of fiscal 2010 revenue we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 10 of our revenue in fiscal 2010 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 

  9 

our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes including changes in reimbursement may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2010 the largest trade receivable balance due from a single customer represented approximately 8 of accounts receivable net 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers including generic pharmaceutical manufacturers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets general economic conditions and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example the florida prescription drug pedigree laws and regulations that became effective in july 2006 imposed obligations upon us to deliver prescription drug pedigrees to various categories of customers in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays other states have adopted laws and regulations that would require us to implement pedigree capabilities in those other states similar to the pedigree capabilities implemented for florida for example california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of costly track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification device “rfid” technologies although the effective date of the law has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and until july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of certain of the fda pedigree regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the federal court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed this injunction on july 10 2008 in late 2009 the parties filed a joint motion to stay discovery and agreed to administrative closing of the file to monitor the progress of counterfeit drug enforcement legislation then pending in congress on september 30 2010 the parties filed a joint motion to extend this stay until june 30 2011 because the bill that led to the administrative closing was and currently remains pending in congress either party may reopen the file at any time before june 30 2011 however if no letter application is made to reopen the file by that time the parties may be considered to have abandoned their claims andor defenses in the case we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as rfid devices and other technologies the 2007 act requires the fda to develop a standardized numerical identifier sni by april 1 2010 in march 2010 fda issued guidance regarding the development of snis for prescription drug packages in this guidance fda identifies packagelevel snis as an initial step in fda’s development and implementation of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

  10 

the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers’ licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

in 2007 our orlando florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals was suspended and later reinstated under an agreement with the dea when we implemented an enhanced and more sophisticated ordermonitoring program in all of our abdc distribution centers in addition in 2008 one of our subsidiaries bellco drug corp received a new dea registration following the suspension of its license and entry into a consent judgment with the dea prior to our acquisition of the business while we expect to continue to comply with all of the dea’s requirements there can be no assurance that the dea will not require further controls against the diversion of controlled substances in the future or will not take similar action against any other of our distribution centers in the future 

legal regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and the businesses of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined 

in march 2010 the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education and reconciliation act of 2010 collectively known as the “affordable care act” became law the affordable care act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to approximately 32 million uninsured americans through a combination of insurance market reforms an expansion of medicaid subsidies and health insurance mandates when fully implemented these provisions are expected to increase the number of people in the united states who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of prescription drug costs other provisions of the affordable care act seek to reduce health care spending such as by increasing manufacturer medicaid drug rebates revising the calculation of medicaid drug reimbursement establishing an independent payment advisory board to achieve additional medicare savings and establishing a regulatory pathway for the approval of followon biologicals promoting valuebased purchasing and making other major changes to reimbursement for most types of medicare providers and suppliers in addition the affordable care act provides for a number of changes to the medicare part d program including additional subsidies for beneficiaries in the part d “coverage gap” the law also requires drug and device manufacturers to disclose their relationships with physicians and teaching hospitals it requires manufacturers and group purchasing organizations that do business with federal health programs to disclose certain physician ownership and investment interests the affordable care act also imposes among many other policy changes significant new fees and excise taxes on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers expands enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse expands comparative effectiveness research and requires testing of health care delivery reforms while certain provisions of the affordable care act took effect immediately others have delayed effective dates given the scope of the changes made by the affordable care act and the ongoing implementation efforts we cannot predict at this time the impact of the new law on our operations 

effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price “amp” on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring the secretary of health and human services to provide amp data to the states on a monthly basis and also to disclose through a website accessible to the public amp prices for branded and generic pharmaceuticals in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing certain provisions of the amp rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program the order also enjoins cms from disclosing amp data to states and disclosing the pricing on a website accessible to the public in october 2008 cms issued a separate final rule stating that the federal upper limits will govern in all states unless a state finds that a particular generic drug is not available within that state these payment limits remain unenforced as a result of the 2007 preliminary injunction the outcome of the ongoing litigation in the district of columbia is unknown the medicaid improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 “mippa” delayed the adoption of certain provisions of cms’s july 17 2007 rule and prevented cms from publishing amp data before october 1 2009 on november 15 2010 cms 

  11 

published a final rule withdrawing certain provisions of the july 2007 and october 2008 final rules in light of the legal challenges to the rules and the enactment of the affordable care act which includes provisions that redefined “average manufacturer price” and “multiple source drug” and established a new formula for calculating federal upper limits under the affordable care act federal upper limits for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis are set at no less than 175 of the weighted average determined on the basis of utilization of the most recently reported monthly amp using a smoothing process any reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability the affordable care act also amends the medicaid rebate statute to among other things increase minimum medicaid rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers increase “additional rebates” for new formulations of certain brand name drugs establish a maximum rebate and extend rebates to the states for drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations the affordable care act’s redefinition of amp is expected to result in most instances in a higher amp this higher amp coupled with the higher minimum medicaid rebate percentage is expected to result in increased medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers which could indirectly impact our business we are currently assessing the potential impact of these provisions on our business the federal government also could take other actions in the future that impact medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts there can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations 

first databank inc and medispan publish drug databases that contain drug information and pricing data the pricing data includes average wholesale price or awp which is a pricing benchmark widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers awp is also used to establish the pricing of pharmaceuticals to certain of our pharmaceutical distribution customers in puerto rico on september 3 2009 the court of appeals for the first circuit upheld settlements in class action litigation concerning the calculations of awp pricing data under the settlements first databank inc and medispan reduced to 20 the markup on about 1400 drugs included in the litigation the companies also reduced to 20 the markup on all drugs with a markup higher than 20 and are expected to stop publishing awp in 2011 we continue to evaluate the impact that these actions could have on the business of our customers and our business there can be no assurances that these settlements and related actions will not have an adverse impact on the business of our customers andor our business 

the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 among other things requires cms to adjust medicare part b drug average sales price “asp” calculations to use volumeweighed asps based on actual sales volume this law which became effective april 1 2008 has reduced and could continue to reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs which may indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in reductions in our profitability the reduction in reimbursement rates for part b drugs particularly affects our absg customers some of whom have moved from private practice to hospital settings absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by these and other changes in medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower growth or lower revenues for absg 

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use in addition the fda is requiring all erythropoiesis stimulating agents anemia drugs or esas to be prescribed and used under a “risk evaluation and mitigation strategy” “rems” to ensure the safe use of these drugs and has announced that it is reviewing new clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with anemia drugs and may take additional action with regard to these drugs cms also is reviewing medicare coverage policy for these drugs for treatment of anemia in adults with chronic kidney disease and additional reviews are possible in the future any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues in addition beginning in january 1 2011 cms is implementing a prospective payment system for medicare endstage renal disease esrd services as mandated by mippa that provides a single bundled payment to dialysis facilities covering most esrd services including esas including any oral forms that are furnished to individuals for the treatment of esrd we cannot at this time assess the impact this upcoming payment system will have on our business our sales of anemia drugs including those used in oncology represented approximately 5 of revenue in fiscal 2010

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the new medicare part d program beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in outpatient prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability mippa and the affordable care act both made additional changes to the part d program notably the affordable care act provides additional assistance to beneficiaries who reach the part d “coverage gap” including a manufacturer discount program mandates additional medication therapy management services reduces part d subsidies for certain highincome beneficiaries and mandates new dispensing techniques for dispensing drugs to longterm care residents to reduce prescription drug waste beginning in 2012 cms continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement these statutory changes and further refine medicare part d program rules there can be no assurances that recent and future changes to the part d program will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities at this time we can provide no assurances that such changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the affordable care act while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

the enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in canada including the profitability of that business 

as in the united states our products and services function within the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in canada the purchase of pharmaceutical products in canada is funded in part by the provincial governments which each regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently in recent years like the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending for example in 2006 the ontario government enacted the transparent drug system for patients act which significantly revised the drug distribution system in ontario on july 1 2010 the ontario government finalized regulatory changes to reform the rules regarding the sale of generic drugs in ontario to among other things reduce costs for taxpayers these changes include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals in both the public governmentsponsored plans and private markets and the elimination of professional allowances paid to pharmacists changes in generic drug prices also affect the cash values of the percentage markups that may be charged by pharmacies these reforms may result in lower service fees cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services in addition any fees based on percentage of drug prices will be reduced by any reductions to generic drug prices themselves legislation andor regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well the legislative changes in ontario had an immediate impact on quebec because it requires manufacturers to sell pharmaceuticals to quebec at the lowest price in canada the governments of alberta and british columbia have also taken steps to reduce the prices for generic drugs listed on their formularies we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability in canada revenue from our canadian operations in fiscal 2010 was less than 2 of our consolidated revenue

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of both the federal civil false claims act and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a “relator” ie whistleblower to file civil actions under these federal and state statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under the federal civil false claims act and the applicable state civil false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on federal and state government authorities to investigate the allegations and to determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases may involve allegations around the marketing sale andor purchase of branded pharmaceutical products and wrongdoing in the marketing sale andor purchase of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and for damages arising from resultant false claims and if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

a qui tam matter is pending in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the “federal district court action” naming amgen inc as well as two business units of amerisourcebergen specialty group asd specialty healthcare inc “asd” and international nephrology network “inn” as defendants as described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this annual report on form 10k 

under the federal civil false claims act and the applicable state civil false claims acts the filing of the original qui tam complaint by the former amgen employee triggered obligations of federal and certain state government authorities to investigate the allegations and to determine whether or not to intervene in the action in connection with this investigative process the company has received subpoenas for records issued by the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the “department of justice” the allegations of the plaintiffs in the federal district court action are within the scope of the department of justice’s subpoenas the company has been cooperating with the department of justice in the inquiry and is producing records in response to the subpoenas 

the company has learned that there are both prior and subsequent filings in another federal district including a complaint filed by a former employee of the company that are under seal and that involve allegations similar to those in the federal district court action against the same andor additional subsidiaries or businesses of the company that are defendants in the federal district court action including the company’s group purchasing organization for oncologists and the company’s oncology distribution business the department of justice’s investigation of the allegations being pursued in the federal district court action appears to include investigation of the allegations contained in some or all of these other filings 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are found liable for the violations alleged in the federal district court action andor if the department of justice should elect to intervene in the pending case andor if there should be any other qui tam cases that arise against us or are pending but yet unsealed including cases against the same andor additional subsidiaries or businesses of the company that are defendants in the federal district court action 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  14 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

we have pharmaceutical distribution operations based in canada and provide contract packaging and clinical trials materials services in the united kingdom we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties a third party service provider ibm is responsible for managing a significant portion of abdc’s information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

we have begun to implement an erp system which when completed will handle the business and financial processes within abdc’s operations and our corporate and administrative functions such as i facilitating the purchase and distribution of inventory items from our distribution centers ii receiving processing and shipping orders on a timely basis iii managing the accuracy of billings and collections for our customers iv processing payments to our suppliers and v generating financial transactions and information erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect 

additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems our ability to produce financial reports andor the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and the united kingdom as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of certain foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

operating results 

revenue of 780 billion in fiscal 2010 which included bulk deliveries to customer warehouses increased 86 from the prior fiscal year the increase in revenue was due to the 10 growth of abdc and the 5 growth of absg during fiscal 2010 70 of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 30 was sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2009 of 69 institutional and 31 retail sales to institutional customers increased 10 in the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased 6 in the current fiscal year 

abdc’s revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by 10 from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market growth revenue from our new customers primarily the new buying group customers with which we started doing business in march and april of 2009 and a new alternate site customer which we added in august 2009 collectively representing approximately 4 of abdc’s revenue growth in fiscal 2010 and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers 

absg’s revenue in fiscal 2010 of 163 billion increased 5 from the prior fiscal year due to growth of its distribution businesses primarily relating to the distribution of nephrology and blood products and its third party logistics business the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals especially oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 

we currently expect to grow our revenues between 2 and 4 in fiscal 2011 our estimated revenue growth in fiscal 2011 reflects the growth rate of the overall pharmaceutical market and the september 2010 discontinuance of our contract with an absg third party logistics customer that has transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model this customer loss will impact our revenue growth and absg’s revenue growth in fiscal 2011 by approximately 1 and 5 respectively our expected growth reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization the introduction of new products and higher branded pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics our growth also may be impacted among other things by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry sales in the united states as recently estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc “ims” are expected to grow annually between 2 and 5 through 2014 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brandname pharmaceutical manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates and changes in federal government rules and regulations

gross profit of 24 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by 2566 million or 12 from the prior fiscal year this increase was in large part attributable to our revenue growth the continued strong growth and profitability of our generic programs with generic revenue increasing by 17 in comparison to the prior fiscal year and increased contributions from feeforservice agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers in august 2009 a generic oncology drug oxaliplatin was introduced launched and absg’s gross profit significantly benefited from this generic launch in fiscal 2010 the gross profit benefit that we continue to receive from this generic launch significantly exceeds the typical benefit we have experienced in the past from generic launches approximately onethird of the gross profit increase for fiscal 2010 was derived from this new generic product launch while we expect an increase in the number of brand to generic conversions in the future the amount of gross profit attributable to each generic launch can vary significantly depending on the individual characteristics of each new product as a result generic launches can cause significant variability in our results of operations there can be no assurance that future generic launches will contribute as significantly to our gross profit as they did in fiscal 2010 additionally in fiscal 2010 we recognized a gain of 207 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this gain was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold we are unable to estimate future gains if any we will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note 13 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements lastly in fiscal 2010 we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us our gross profit benefited by approximately 12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation 

as a percentage of revenue our gross profit margin of 302 in fiscal 2010 improved by 9 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the strong growth and profitability of our generic programs including new and recent generic launches and increased contributions from feeforservice agreements with brand name pharmaceutical manufacturers additionally the gain on antitrust litigation settlements as noted above had the effect of increasing our gross profit margin by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010 all of these factors more than offset the above market growth of some of our largest customers who benefit from our best pricing and normal competitive pressures on customer margins 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 302 million and 151 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009 respectively the increase in our lifo charge reflects strong brand name price inflation and a yearoveryear reduction in generic price deflation 

operating expenses of 13 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by 367 million or 3 from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in bad debt expense of 113 million primarily relating to physician customers within absg’s oncology business an increase in incentive compensation an increase in depreciation and amortization of 76 million and additional expenses incurred relating to our business transformation project which includes a new enterprise resource planning “erp” platform the above increases were offset in part by a 99 million reduction in facility consolidations employee severance and other costs and a 47 million reduction in asset impairment charges asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included a writeoff of capitalized software of 67 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses and intangible asset impairment charges of 32 million asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included intangible asset impairment charges of 118 million and the writeoff of capitalized software of 28 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 161 in fiscal 2010 and represented a significant 8 basis point decline in our operating expense ratio from the prior fiscal year reflecting our strong operating leverage particularly within abdc as its operating expenses remained relatively flat in fiscal 2010 in comparison to the prior fiscal year despite its 10 revenue growth our operating leverage has benefited from significant productivity increases achieved from our highly automated distribution facilities and our ce2 initiative as described below 

  24 

in july 2010 and october 2010 we implemented the first and second phases of our new erp platform as a result we started to depreciate a significant portion of our capitalized project costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 additionally we started to incur other significant costs to support our new erp platform as we have begun the transition from our legacy information systems to our erp platform this transition is expected to last through the end of 2012 the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms including depreciation are expected to be approximately 40 million per year during the transition period we intend to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs by reducing expenses elsewhere but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 

in fiscal 2008 we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative “ce2” designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness in connection with these efforts we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions in fiscal 2009 we terminated 197 employees and incurred 31 million of employee severance costs relating to our ce2 initiative additionally in fiscal 2009 we recorded 22 million of expense to increase our liability relating to the bergen brunswig matter as described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2010 we reversed our remaining 44 million liability relating to this matter 

operating income of 11 billion in fiscal 2010 increased 2199 million or 25 from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit as a percentage of revenue operating income increased 19 basis points to 142 in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in our gross profit margin and the decrease in our operating expense ratio 

the net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the benefit from facility consolidations employee severance and other and the intangible asset impairments increased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2010 the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other and the intangible asset impairments decreased operating income as a percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2009 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were as follows in thousands 

 

interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of 1832 million in average borrowings offset in part by an increase in interest costs capitalized relating to our business transformation project and a decrease in the weightedaverage variable interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to 171 from 208 in the prior fiscal year interest costs capitalized in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were 66 million and 29 million respectively we expect to capitalize significantly less interest costs related to our business transformation project in fiscal 2011 since we began to implement our new erp platform in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in the weighted average interest rate offset in part by an increase in average invested cash of 5783 million 

average borrowings increased in fiscal 2010 resulting from the november 2009 issuance of 400 million of new 10year senior notes offset in part by the repayment of substantially all amounts then outstanding under out multicurrency revolving credit facility both described in liquidity and capital resources 

our net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates amendments andor renewals to our current borrowing facilities and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

income taxes in fiscal 2010 reflect an effective income tax rate of 380 compared to 379 in the prior fiscal year due to the impact of discrete tax events we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal 2010 and 2009 thereby reducing our effective tax rate from a normalized 384 

income from continuing operations of 6367 million in fiscal 2010 increased 24 from 5119 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 222 in fiscal 2010 increased 31 from 169 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 5 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises

year ended september 30 2009 compared with year ended september 30 2008 

operating results 

revenue of 718 billion in fiscal 2009 increased 2 from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to the 7 growth of absg and the 18 growth of abdc which was impacted by the july 1 2008 loss of certain business approximately 3 billion on an annualized basis with a national retail drug chain customer excluding the loss of the abovementioned business revenue in fiscal 2009 would have increased by 5 from the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2009 and 2008 69 of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 31 was from sales to retail customers sales to institutional customers increased 3 primarily due to the growth of absg and the addition of a new large hospital buying group customer sales to retail customers decreased slightly in the current fiscal year as the loss of the above mentioned national chain business was offset in part by market growth and the addition of a new large independent retail buying group customer 

abdc’s revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by 18 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to revenue from two new large customers and was partially offset by the loss of certain business with a large retail drug chain customer as mentioned above 

absg’s revenue in fiscal 2009 of 156 billion increased 7 from the prior fiscal year due to good growth broadly across its distribution and service businesses offset in part by declining anemia drug sales see paragraph below the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology 

revenue related to the distribution of anemiarelated products which represented 5 of revenue in fiscal 2009 decreased approximately 7 from the prior fiscal year the decline in sales of anemiarelated products has been most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment sales of oncology anemiarelated products represented approximately 18 of total revenue in fiscal 2009 and decreased approximately 25 from the prior fiscal year several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with undergoing dialysis or experiencing kidney failure and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use as a result oncologyrelated anemia drug sales declined further in fiscal 2009 from our fiscal 2008 total 

gross profit of 21 billion in fiscal 2009 increased by 531 million or 3 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the strong growth and increased profitability of our generic programs including specialty generics with generic revenue increasing by 15 in comparison to the prior fiscal year increased contributions from our feeforservice agreements including 102 million of fees relating to prior period sales resulting from the execution of new agreements in the quarter ended december 31 2008 and good growth from absg’s businesses all of which was offset in part by absg’s 155 million writedown of influenza vaccine inventory in the december 2008 quarter and normal competitive pressures on customer margins in the current fiscal year gross profit in fiscal 2009 benefited from a settlement of 18 million with a former customer gross profit in the prior fiscal year benefited from a gain of 132 million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer and a major competitor and an 86 million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier and was partially offset by an 84 million inventory writedown of certain pharmacy equipment additionally in the prior fiscal year we recognized a gain of 35 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers as a percentage of revenue gross profit in fiscal 2009 was 293 an increase of 1 basis point from the prior fiscal year 

we recorded a lifo charge of 151 million and 211 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the fiscal 2009 and 2008 lifo charges reflect brand name supplier price inflation which more than offset price deflation of generic drugs 

operating expenses of 12 billion in fiscal 2009 declined by nearly 30 million when compared to the prior fiscal year as a decrease in facility consolidations employee severance and other charges of 70 million a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of 32 million and a decrease in asset impairment charges of 15 million were offset in part by an increase in bad debt expense of 42 million asset impairment charges in fiscal 2009 included intangible asset impairment charges of 118 million and the writeoff of certain capitalized software totaling 28 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses asset impairment charges in fiscal 2008 included intangible asset impairment charges of 53 million related to certain of our smaller business units and impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling 108 million included within distribution selling and administrative expenses primarily due to abdc’s decision to abandon the use of certain software which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project additionally expenses incurred in fiscal 2009 in connection with our business transformation project increased by 138 million from the prior fiscal year as a result of our ce2 initiative described below we were able to substantially offset these incremental costs by reducing our warehouse operating costs through continuing productivity improvements and by streamlining our organizational structures within abdc and absg as a percentage of revenue operating expenses were 169 and 174 in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  26 

the following table illustrates the charges incurred relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 in thousands 

 

in fiscal 2008 we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative “ce2” designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness in connection with these efforts we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we terminated 197 and 130 employees and incurred 31 million and 100 million of employee severance costs respectively relating to our ce2 initiative additionally in fiscal 2009 we recorded 22 million of additional expense relating to the bergen brunswig matter as described in note 12 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2008 we reversed 10 million of employee severance charges previously estimated and recorded relating to a prior integration plan costs related to business divestitures in fiscal 2008 related to the sale of our former workers’ compensation business pmsi 

operating income of 8837 million in fiscal 2009 increased 7 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue operating income of 123 in fiscal 2009 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the 2 increase in revenue while operating expense dollars remained relatively flat 

the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other and the charges relating to intangible asset impairments less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements had the effect of decreasing operating income as a percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were as follows in thousands 

 

interest expense decreased from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease of 904 million in average borrowings and a decrease in the weighted—average interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to 208 from 477 in the prior fiscal year interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline in the weighted—average interest rate offset in part by an increase in average invested cash of 2185 million 

income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflect an effective income tax rate of 379 versus 384 in the prior fiscal year due to the impact of discrete tax events we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal 2009 thereby reducing our effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year 

income from continuing operations of 5119 million in fiscal 2009 increased 9 from 4691 million in the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income the decrease in interest expense and the reduction in the effective income tax rate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 169 in fiscal 2009 increased 17 from 144 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was due to the 7 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

  27 

loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in fiscal 2009 included a final pmsi working capital adjustment of 28 million and costs in connection with a prior period business disposition loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in fiscal 2008 primarily related to the pmsi business and included a 2248 million charge net of income taxes to reduce its carrying value 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers’ financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2010 2009 and 2008 was 431 million 318 million and 276 million respectively an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2010 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 39 million 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2010 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 88 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 78 and 75 of our inventories at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if we had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 2213 million and 1911 higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2010 and 2009 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 302 million 151 million and 211 million in fiscal 2010 2009 and 2008 respectively 

  28 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements patents and software technology are amortized over their estimated useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit andor the component of the entity being valued we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value “impairment indicators” this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management in fiscal 2009 due to the existence of impairment indicators at us bioservices a specialty pharmacy company within the company’s specialty group we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy’s trade name as of june 30 2009 which resulted in an impairment charge of 89 million in fiscal 2008 our pmsi business unit which we sold in fiscal 2009 experienced certain customer losses and learned that it would lose its largest customer at the end of calendar 2008 as a result and after considering other factors we committed to a plan to divest pmsi we performed an interim impairment test of our pmsi reporting unit and determined that its goodwill was impaired therefore pmsi wroteoff the carrying value of its goodwill of 1991 million in addition we also recognized charges of 267 million to record the estimated loss on the sale of pmsi see note 3 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and 2009 and as a result recorded 25 million and 16 million of impairment charges respectively our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option future volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

  29 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 103 million in fiscal 2010

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2010 including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 

 

along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 

we have a 695 million multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in november 2011 the “multicurrency revolving credit facility” with a syndicate of lenders interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable 32 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee at september 30 2010 additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate we pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment 8 basis points at september 30 2010 we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test as well as others that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales 

we have a 700 million receivables securitization facility “receivables securitization facility” in april 2010 we amended this facility which now expires in april 2011 we continue to have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper or libor plus a program fee we pay a commitment fee to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility in connection with the april 2010 commitment the program fee and commitment fee were reduced to 125 basis points and 60 basis points respectively at september 30 2010 there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility the receivables securitization facility contains similar covenants to the multicurrency revolving credit facility in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources 

in fiscal 2011 we will seek to renew the multicurrency revolving credit facility and the receivables securitization facility at available market rates which may be higher than the rates currently available to us 

  31 

in april 2010 we amended the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility the “blanco credit facility” to among other things extend the maturity date of the blanco credit facility to april 2011 borrowings under the blanco credit facility are guaranteed by us interest on borrowings under this facility continues to be 200 basis points over libor the blanco credit facility is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2010 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

we have 3923 million of 5 58 senior notes due september 15 2012 the “2012 notes” 500 million of 5 78 senior notes due september 15 2015 the “2015 notes” and 400 million of 4 78 senior notes due november 15 2019 the “2019 notes” the 2012 notes and 2015 notes each were sold at 995 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 571 and 594 respectively the 2019 notes were sold in november 2009 at 99174 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 498 interest on the 2012 notes the 2015 notes and the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears all of the senior notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock fund the payment of dividends finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures including our business transformation project which involves the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning platform and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities in november 2009 our board of directors approved a program authorizing us to purchase up to 500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions we purchased 4700 million excluding broker fees of our common stock in fiscal 2010 of which 681 million was purchased to close out our prior november 2008 share repurchase program and 4019 million was purchased under the november 2009 share repurchase program as of september 30 2010 we had 981 million of availability remaining on the november 2009 share repurchase program in september 2010 our board of directors approved a new program authorizing us to purchase up to an additional 500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions all of which was available for purchase as of september 30 2010 we currently expect to purchase approximately 400 million of our common stock in fiscal 2011 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements

the 55 million blanco credit facility which expires in april 2011 is included in the “within 1 year” column in the above table however this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2010 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

we have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers for the 20102011 flu season in our current fiscal year we reduced our commitment to only the 20102011 flu season we are required to purchase doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements as amended will be approximately 274 million as of september 30 2010 these influenza vaccine commitments are included in “other commitments” in the above table

market risk 

our most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2010 we had 559 million of variable rate debt outstanding the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2010 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 17 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2010 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates such contracts generally have durations of less than one year we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september 30 2010 we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements

 item 1   business tableend 

as used herein the terms “company” “amerisourcebergen” “we” “us” or “our” refer to amerisourcebergen corporation a delaware corporation 

amerisourcebergen corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies with operations primarily in the united states and canada servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel we provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers primarily located in the united states and canada including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical and dialysis clinics physicians longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers we also provide pharmacy services to certain specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmaceutical packaging pharmacy automation inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and pharmacy management 

industry overview 

pharmaceutical sales in the united states as recently estimated by ims healthcare inc “ims” an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry are expected to grow between 3 and 5 in calendar 2010 ims expects that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market additionally ims expects the us pharmaceutical industry to grow annually in the low to midsingle digit percentages through 2013 

in addition to general economic conditions factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals age 55 and over in the united states currently exceeds 70 million and is one of the most rapidly growing segments of the population this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately 75 of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widely used brandname pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care and other thirdparty payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates in addition the us congress may take action in the future to reduce the number of people in the united states who do not have health insurance coverage and thereby increase the number of people in the united states who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 5 for further details

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2009 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2009 accounted for approximately 48 of our purchases 

information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized system abdc’s operating system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing thirdparty claims processing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically over the last several years abdc has successfully implemented a new warehouse operating system which is used to account for primarily all of abdc’s transactional volume the new warehouse operating system has improved abdc’s productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology 

  4 

in an effort to maintain and improve our existing information technology infrastructure efficiently and costeffectively in 2005 we outsourced a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and corporate functions to ibm global services 

in an effort to continue to make system investments to further improve our information capabilities and meet our future customer and operational needs we began to make significant investments in fiscal 2008 relating to our business transformation project that will include a new enterprise resource planning “erp” platform the erp platform will be implemented throughout abdc and our corporate functions and will include the development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance our business practices and lower costs we expect to continue to make significant investments in our business transformation project through fiscal 2011 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the past few years absg has enhanced its web capabilities such that a significant amount of orders are initiated via the internet 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest national competitors are cardinal health inc “cardinal” and mckesson corporation “mckesson” abdc competes with both cardinal and mckesson as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absg’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson fff enterprises henry schein inc express scripts inc us oncology inc covance inc and ups logistics among others in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2009 we had approximately 10300 employees of which approximately 9100 were fulltime employees approximately 4 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of federal and state laws regulations and policies 

federal and state statutes and regulation 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances are required to hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of applicable laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these laws and regulations we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

  5 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and the stark law the antikickback statute and the related regulations prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing leasing or ordering induce a referral to purchase lease or order or arrange for or recommend purchasing leasing or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services reimbursable under medicare or medicaid to certain entities with which they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation absg’s operations are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain aspects of abdc’s operations 

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system for example florida has implemented and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by information tracking drugs back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using electronic pedigrees although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers these and other requirements are expected to increase our cost of operations at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the fda regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase our costs andor burden of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the federal court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed this injunction on july 10 2008 on december 18 2008 the parties filed a joint motion to stay discovery based upon a bill pending in congress that if passed would render the issues in the case moot the parties also agreed to an administrative closing of the file until at least december 31 2009 either party may reopen the file prior to that date we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding or related legislation pending in congress these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our distribution business and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification devices and other technologies the 2007 act requires the fda to develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we expect that the current administration congress and certain state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods in order to reform the healthcare system this process may result in legislation andor additional regulation governing the delivery or pricing of pharmaceutical products as well as potential changes to the structure of the present healthcare delivery system we cannot predict what reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

medicare and medicaid 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the new medicare part d program beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in outpatient prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beneficiaries who participate select from a range of standalone prescription drug plans or medicare advantage managed care plans that include prescription drug coverage along with other medicare services “part d plans” the part d plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies each part d plan negotiates reimbursement for part d drugs with pharmaceutical manufacturers the part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability 

the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 “mippa” established timeframes for part d plan payments to pharmacies and longterm care pharmacy submission of claims required more frequent updating by part d plan sponsors of the drug pricing data they use to pay pharmacies modified statutory provisions regarding coverage of certain “protected classes” of drugs limited certain part d sales and marketing activities and made other part d reforms 

  6 

effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price or amp on july 17 2007 centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing certain provisions of the amp rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program the order also enjoined cms from disclosing amp data to states and other entities in october 2008 cms issued a separate final rule in which it stated that the federal upper limits will govern in all states unless a state finds that a particular generic drug is not available within that state these payment limits remain unenforced as a result of the 2007 preliminary injunction in addition mippa delayed the adoption of cms’s july 17 2007 rule and prevented cms from publishing amp data before october 1 2009 although cms has yet to take action the use of an amp benchmark may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect our results of operations the federal government may also take other actions in the future to increase the medicaid drug rebate amount for branded pharmaceuticals amend the medicare average selling price “asp” calculation methodology or otherwise modify medicaremedicaid drug payment policy 

several medicare and medicaid policy reforms were included in president obama’s proposed fiscal year 2010 budget among other things the budget includes a 10year 634 billion “reserve fund” to finance comprehensive health reform financed by health system savings and tax increases provides for payment cuts to medicare advantage plans and plans to reduce medicare reimbursement for many types of providers including hospitals and certain postacute care providers the budget also calls for increasing the medicaid drug rebate level paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to medicaid for brandname drugs applying the rebate levels paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers to medicaid on existing drugs to new formulations of those drugs and allowing states to collect rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers on drugs provided through medicaid managed care organizations it further seeks to increase medicare part d drug premiums for certain higherincome beneficiaries expand part d oversight activities promote the development of followon biologicals and generic drugs and allow drug reimportation many of the proposed policy changes would require congressional approval to implement there can be no assurances that future revisions to medicare or medicaid payments if enacted will not have an adverse impact on our business 

congressional leaders also have expressed their intent to enact a comprehensive health reform plan including provisions to control health care costs improve health care quality and expand access to affordable health insurance potentially including the establishment of a government health insurance plan that would compete with private health plans health reform legislation could include changes in medicare and medicaid prescription drug payment policies and other health care delivery reforms that would potentially impact our business the united states house of representatives has passed its version of a health reform bill but the united states senate has not yet taken action on pending health reform proposals as a result the exact provisions to be included in a final bill are unknown at this time nor can we be certain when or if any such legislation will be enacted given the potentially sweeping nature of the changes under consideration there can be no assurances that health reform legislation if adopted would not adversely impact our business 

see “risk factors” on page 8 for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and its accompanying federal regulations set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information in addition our operations depending on their location may be subject to additional state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

on february 17 2009 president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act “arra” among other things the law further strengthens federal privacy and security provisions to protect personallyidentifiable health information including new notification requirements related to health data security breaches we currently are assessing the new law but there can be no assurances that compliance with the new privacy requirements will not impose new costs on our business

 item 1a   risk factors tableend 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals cardinal and mckesson national generic distributors regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies see “competition” if we were forced by competition to reduce our prices or offer more favorable payment or other terms our results of operations or liquidity could be adversely affected in addition in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result approximately 10 to 15 of our gross profit from brandname manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of price appreciation if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption 

the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption particularly in the latter half of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009 in some cases the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength if the markets return to the levels of disruption and volatility experienced in the latter half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009 there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our receivables securitization facility expires in 2010 while we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of september 30 2009 we have historically utilized amounts available to us under this facility from time to time to meet our business needs in fiscal 2010 we will seek to renew this facility at available market rates which may be higher than the interest rates currently available to us while we believe we will be able to renew this facility there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 

  8 

our total revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

our largest customer medco health solutions inc accounted for 17 of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 our top ten customers represented approximately 41 of fiscal 2009 total revenue we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 10 of our total revenue in fiscal 2009 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our total revenue and results of operations 

our total revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured volatility of the capital and credit markets and general economic conditions may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2009 the largest trade receivable balance due from a single customer which was our largest customer represented approximately 9 of accounts receivable net 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods chargebacks and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers volatility of the capital and credit markets and general economic conditions may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example the florida prescription drug pedigree laws and regulations that became effective in july 2006 imposed obligations upon us to deliver prescription drug pedigrees to various categories of customers in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays other states have adopted laws and regulations that would require us to implement pedigree capabilities in those other states similar to the pedigree capabilities implemented for florida for example california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of costly track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification device “rfid” technologies although the effective date of the law has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and until july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of certain provisions of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the federal court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed this injunction on july 10 2008 on december 18 2008 the parties filed a joint motion to stay discovery based upon a bill pending in congress that if passed would render the issues in the case moot the parties also agreed to an administrative closing of the file until at least december 31 2009 either party may reopen the file prior to that date we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding or related legislation pending in congress 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as rfid devices and other technologies the 2007 act requires the fda to develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010 the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

  9 

the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers’ licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

in 2007 our orlando florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals was suspended for an alleged lack of maintaining effective controls against diversion of controlled substances under an agreement with the dea our distribution center had its license reinstated when we implemented an enhanced and more sophisticated ordermonitoring program in all of our abdc distribution centers in addition in june 2007 one of our subsidiaries bellco drug corp entered into a consent judgment with the dea following the suspension of bellco drug’s dea license in may 2007 prior to our acquisition of the business the dea had alleged that bellco drug had failed to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances as required by federal law in the consent judgment bellco drug voluntarily surrendered its dea registration with leave to apply for a new registration bellco drug received its new dea registration on february 12 2008 and resumed distribution of controlled substances while we expect to continue to comply with all of the dea’s requirements there can be no assurance that the dea will not require further controls against the diversion of controlled substances in the future or will not take similar action against any other of our distribution centers in the future 

legal regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our business and the businesses of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined 

effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price “amp” on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing certain provisions of the amp rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program the order also enjoins cms from disclosing amp data to states and other entities in october 2008 cms issued a separate final rule stating that the federal upper limits will govern in all states unless a state finds that a particular generic drug is not available within that state these payment limits remain unenforced as a result of the 2007 preliminary injunction the outcome of the ongoing litigation in the district of columbia is unknown the medicaid improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 “mippa” delayed the adoption of cms’s july 17 2007 rule and prevented cms from publishing amp data before october 1 2009 although cms has yet to take action the use of an amp benchmark may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could significantly reduce our profitability 

  10 

the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 among other things requires cms to adjust medicare part b drug average sales price “asp” calculations to use volumeweighed asps based on actual sales volume this law which became effective april 1 2008 could reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs which may indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in reductions in our profitability 

first databank inc and medispan publish drug databases that contain drug information and pricing data the pricing data includes average wholesale price or awp which is a pricing benchmark widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers awp is also used to establish the pricing of pharmaceuticals to certain of our pharmaceutical distribution customers in puerto rico on september 3 2009 the court of appeals for the first circuit upheld settlements in class action litigation concerning the calculations of awp pricing data under the settlements first databank inc and medispan reduced to 20 the markup on about 1400 drugs included in the litigation the companies also reduced to 20 the markup on all drugs with a markup higher than 20 and will stop publishing awp in two years we continue to evaluate the impact that these actions could have on the business of our customers and our business there can be no assurances that these settlements and related actions will not have an adverse impact on the business of our customers andor our business 

absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by changes in medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower growth or lower revenues for absg 

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use in addition the fda has announced that it is reviewing new clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents anemia drugs and may take additional action with regard to these drugs cms has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future also on july 30 2008 cms announced it is considering a review of national medicare coverage policy for these drugs for patients who have cancer or predialysis chronic kidney disease any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities at this time we can provide no assurances that such changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

changes to the united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

congressional leaders also have expressed their intention to enact a comprehensive health reform plan including provisions to control health care costs improve health care quality and expand access to affordable health insurance potentially including the establishment of a government health insurance plan that would compete with private health plans health reform legislation could include changes in medicare and medicaid prescription drug payment policies and other health care delivery reforms that would potentially impact our business the united states house of representatives has passed its version of a health reform bill but the united states senate has not yet taken action on pending health reform proposals as a result the exact provisions to be included in a final bill are unknown at this time nor can we be certain when or if any such legislation will be enacted given the potentially sweeping nature of the changes under consideration there can be no assurances that health reform legislation if adopted will not adversely impact our business 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation 

violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products can result in criminal civil and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages criminal and civil penalties and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs among other things such violations can form the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed the qui tam provisions of both the federal civil false claims act and various state civil false claims acts authorize a private person known as a “relator” ie whistleblower to file civil actions under these federal and state statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments under the federal civil false claims act and the applicable state civil false claims acts the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on federal and state government authorities to investigate the allegations and to determine whether or not to intervene in the action such cases typically revolve around the marketing sale andor purchase of branded pharmaceutical products and allege wrongdoing in the marketing sale andor purchase of such products such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and for damages arising from resultant false claims and if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters andor we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters 

a qui tam matter is pending in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts the “federal district court” naming amgen inc as well as two business units of amerisourcebergen specialty group amerisourcebergen specialty group and amerisourcebergen corporation as defendants on october 30 2009 the relator a former amgen employee filed a second amended complaint and fourteen states and the district of columbia filed a complaint the “intervention complaint” to intervene in the pending civil case the complaints allege that from 2002 through 2009 amgen offered remuneration to medical providers in violation of federal and state health laws to increase purchases and prescriptions of amgen’s anemia drug aranesp specifically with regard to the company’s business units the complaints allege that asd specialty healthcare inc which is a distributor of pharmaceuticals to physician practices “asd” and international nephrology network which was a business name for one of the company’s subsidiaries and a group purchasing organization for nephrologists and nephrology practices “inn” conspired with amgen to promote aranesp in violation of federal and state health laws the complaints further allege that the defendants caused medical providers to submit to state medicaid programs false certifications and false claims for payment for aranesp according to the complaints the latter conduct allegedly violated state civil false claims acts and constituted fraud and unjust enrichment the qui tam complaint as amended on october 30 2009 also alleges that the defendants caused medical providers to submit to other federal health programs including medicare false certifications and false claims for payment for aranesp 

under the federal civil false claims act and the applicable state civil false claims acts the filing of the original qui tam complaint by the former amgen employee triggered obligations of federal and certain state government authorities to investigate the allegations and to determine whether or not to intervene in the action in connection with this investigative process the company has received subpoenas for records issued by the united states attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york the “department of justice” the allegations in the intervention complaint and the qui tam complaint as amended are within the scope of the department of justice’s subpoenas the company has been cooperating with the department of justice in the inquiry and is producing records in response to the subpoenas such subpoenas may be issued in conjunction with investigations arising from the filing of one or more qui tam complaints because such lawsuits are filed under seal and remain under seal until the applicable court orders otherwise their existence cannot be disclosed absent court order therefore given the pendency of the department of justice investigation the possibility exists that one or more qui tam suits have been filed 

our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if we are found liable for the violations alleged in the pending qui tam case andor if the department of justice or other state authorities should elect to intervene in the pending case andor if there should be any companion qui tam cases that arise against us and the other defendants or are pending but yet unsealed 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

we have pharmaceutical distribution operations based in canada and provide contract packaging and clinical trials materials services in the united kingdom we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties a third party service provider ibm is responsible for managing a significant portion of abdc’s information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

we are preparing to implement an erp system to handle the business and financial processes within abdc’s operations and our corporate functions erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect 

additionally if we do not effectively implement the erp system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended it could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and the united kingdom as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of certain foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions andor our tax liabilities there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

the enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in canada including the profitability of that business 

as in the united states our products and services function within the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in canada the purchase of pharmaceutical products in canada is funded in part by the provincial governments which each regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently in recent years like the united states the canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending for example in 2006 the ontario government enacted the transparent drug system for patients act which significantly revised the drug distribution system in ontario then in july 2009 the ontario government announced that it was undertaking a review of that legislation with a view to among other things lower costs for taxpayers some of these potential changes such as adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing the drug distribution supply chain prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits or a reduction in government funding for certain healthcare services may result in lower service fees cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services legislation andor regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability in canada

our operations are currently comprised of one reportable segment pharmaceutical distribution the other reportable segment included the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 2007 spinoff date the operating results of pmsi which was sold in october 2008 were reclassified to discontinued operations

amerisourcebergen corporation summary segment information 

 

 

 

 year ended september 30 2009 compared with year ended september 30 2008 

operating results 

total revenue of 718 billion in fiscal 2009 which includes bulk deliveries to customer warehouses increased 2 from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to the 7 growth of absg and the 18 growth of abdc which was impacted by the july 1 2008 loss of certain business approximately 3 billion on an annualized basis with a national retail drug chain customer excluding the loss of the abovementioned business total revenue in fiscal 2009 would have increased by 5 from the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2009 and 2008 68 of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 32 was from sales to retail customers sales to institutional customers increased 5 in the current fiscal year primarily due to the growth of absg and the addition of a new large hospital buying group customer sales to retail customers decreased 4 in the current fiscal year as the loss of the above mentioned national chain business was offset in part by market growth and the addition of a new large independent retail buying group customer 

we report as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby we act as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by us at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites ie drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to us for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites ie crossdock shipment bulk deliveries of 17 billion in fiscal 2009 decreased 36 from the prior fiscal year this decline was due to the prior year transition of a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis with our largest customer to an operating revenue basis we are a principal to bulk delivery transactions because we are the primary obligor and have the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased and bear full risk of delivery and loss for products whether the products are dropshipped or shipped crossdock we also bear full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer as a result we record bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on our operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on our cash flows due to favorable timing between customer payments to us and payments by us to our suppliers 

  23 

abdc’s total revenue in fiscal 2009 increased by 18 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to revenue from two new large customers and was partially offset by the loss of certain business with a large retail drug chain customer as mentioned above 

absg’s total revenue in fiscal 2009 of 156 billion increased 7 from the prior fiscal year due to good growth broadly across its distribution and service businesses offset in part by declining anemia drug sales see paragraph below the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg also distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes affecting this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 

revenue related to the distribution of anemiarelated products which represented 5 of total revenue in fiscal 2009 decreased approximately 7 from the prior fiscal year the decline in sales of anemiarelated products has been most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment sales of oncologyrelated anemia products represented approximately 18 of total revenue in fiscal 2009 and decreased approximately 25 from the prior fiscal year several developments have contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients undergoing dialysis or experiencing kidney failure and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use as a result oncologyrelated anemia drug sales have declined further in fiscal 2009 from our fiscal 2008 total in addition the us food and drug administration “fda” is continuing to review clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with certain anemia products and the centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” announced last year that it is considering a review of national medicare policy for these drugs for patients who have cancer or predialysis kidney disease the fda or cms may take additional action regarding the use safety labeling andor medicare coverage of these drugs in the future further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payors including federal and state governments and private insurance plans our future revenue growth rate andor profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage andor use of anemia drugs 

we expect that our total revenue growth in fiscal 2010 for abdc and absg will be between 5 and 7 due to the addition of two significant new customers in march and april 2009 we expect revenue growth will be higher in the first half of fiscal 2010 than in the second half our expected growth reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization the introduction of new products and higher branded pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics our growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry sales in the united states as recently estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc “ims” are expected to grow between 3 and 5 in calendar 2010 ims expects that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market additionally ims expects the us pharmaceutical industry to grow annually in the low to midsingle digit percentages through 2013 our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as industry growth trends including the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers general economic conditions in the united states competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates and changes in federal government rules and regulations 

gross profit of 21 billion in fiscal 2009 increased by 531 million or 3 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the strong growth and increased profitability of our generic programs including specialty generics with generic revenue increasing by15 in comparison to the prior fiscal year increased contributions from our feeforservice agreements including 102 million of fees relating to prior period sales resulting from the execution of new agreements in the quarter ended december 31 2008 and good growth from absg’s businesses all of which was offset in part by absg’s 155 million writedown of influenza vaccine inventory in the december 2008 quarter and normal competitive pressures on customer margins in the current fiscal year gross profit in fiscal 2009 benefited from a settlement of 18 million with a former customer gross profit in the prior fiscal year benefited from a gain of 132 million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer and a major competitor and an 86 million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier and was partially offset by an 84 million inventory writedown of certain pharmacy equipment additionally in the prior fiscal year we recognized a gain of 35 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers this gain which was excluded from the determination of pharmaceutical distribution segment’s gross profit was recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold the company is unable to estimate future gains if any it will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements as a percentage of total revenue gross profit in fiscal 2009 was 293 an increase of 1 basis point from the prior fiscal year 

  24 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 151 million and 211 million in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively the fiscal 2009 and 2008 lifo charges reflect brandname supplier price inflation which more than offset price deflation of generic drugs 

operating expenses of 12 billion in fiscal 2009 declined by nearly 30 million when compared to the prior fiscal year as a decrease in facility consolidations employee severance and other charges of 70 million a decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of 32 million and a decrease in asset impairment charges of 15 million were offset in part by an increase in bad debt expense of 42 million asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included trade name impairment charges of 118 million and the writeoff of certain capitalized software totaling 28 million asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included trade name impairment charges of 53 million related to certain of our smaller business units and impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling 108 million primarily due to abdc’s decision to abandon the use of certain software which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project additionally expenses incurred in fiscal 2009 in connection with our business transformation project which includes a new enterprise resource planning “erp” platform increased by 138 million from the prior fiscal year as a result of our ce2 initiative described below we have been able to substantially offset these incremental costs by reducing our warehouse operating costs through continuing productivity improvements and by streamlining our organizational structures within abdc and absg as a percentage of total revenue operating expenses were 169 and 174 in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively 

the following table illustrates the charges incurred relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other which are excluded from the operating expenses of the pharmaceutical distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 in thousands 

 

in fiscal 2008 we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative “ce2” designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness in connection with these efforts we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions during fiscal 2009 and 2008 we terminated 197 and 130 employees and incurred 31 million and 100 million of employee severance costs respectively relating to our ce2 initiative additionally in fiscal 2009 we recorded 22 million of additional expense relating to the bergen brunswig matter as described in note 13 legal matters and contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2008 we reversed 10 million of employee severance charges previously estimated and recorded relating to a prior integration plan costs related to business divestitures in fiscal 2008 related to the sale of our former workers’ compensation business pmsi 

we paid a total of 154 million and 68 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs in fiscal 2009 and 2008 respectively remaining unpaid amounts of 114 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying balance sheet at september 30 2009 employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not in excess of 12 months or in the form of a lumpsum payment 

operating income of 8837 million in fiscal 2009 increased 7 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit as a percentage of total revenue operating income of 123 in fiscal 2009 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the 2 increase in revenue while operating expense dollars remained relatively flat 

the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other and the charges relating to intangible asset impairments less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements had the effect of decreasing operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 2 basis points in each of fiscal 2009 and 2008

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2009 and 2008 were as follows in thousands 

 

interest expense decreased from the prior fiscal year due to a decrease of 904 million in average borrowings and a decrease in the weightedaverage interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to 208 from 477 in the prior fiscal year interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline in the weightedaverage interest rate offset in part by an increase in average invested cash of 2185 million 

our net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings interest rates and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

income taxes in fiscal 2009 reflect an effective income tax rate of 379 compared to 384 in the prior fiscal year due to the impact of discrete tax events we were able to recognize certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal 2009 thereby reducing our effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year 

income from continuing operations of 5119 million in fiscal 2009 increased 9 from 4691 million in the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income the decrease in interest expense and the reduction in the effective income tax rate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 169 in fiscal 2009 increased 17 from 144 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the increase in income from continuing operations was due to the 7 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in fiscal 2009 included a final pmsi working capital adjustment of 28 million and costs in connection with a prior period business disposition loss from discontinued operations net of income taxes in fiscal 2008 primarily related to the pmsi business and included a 2248 million charge net of income taxes to reduce its carrying value 

year ended september 30 2008 compared with year ended september 30 2007 

operating results 

total revenue of 702 billion in fiscal 2008 which includes bulk deliveries to customer warehouses increased 7 from the prior fiscal year this increase was driven by the pharmaceutical distribution segment which received a 3 contribution from the bellco acquisition during fiscal 2008 68 of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 32 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 64 institutional and 36 retail in comparison to the prior fiscal year results sales to institutional customers increased 15 primarily due to the acquisition of bellco the revenue of which is heavily weighted towards institutional customers and the strong growth of certain large customers sales to retail customers decreased 5 primarily due to our decision not to renew a contract effective january 2007 with a large retail customer and the july 1 2008 loss of certain business totaling approximately 30 billion of annual revenue from a large retail drug chain customer 

bulk deliveries of 27 billion in fiscal 2008 decreased 39 from the prior fiscal year this decline was due to the fiscal 2008 transition of a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis with our largest customer to an operating revenue basis revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from our largest bulk customer due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on our cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and payments by us to our suppliers 

abdc’s total revenue excluding bellco increased by 5 in fiscal 2008 in comparison to the prior fiscal year this revenue growth was primarily due to the increase in sales to certain of our large institutional customers offset in part by the decline in retail customer revenue as discussed above 

absg’s total revenue excluding bellco of 130 billion in fiscal 2008 increased 3 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong doubledigit growth of its nononcology distribution businesses oncology distribution’s revenue which represented approximately 60 of absg’s total revenue was flat compared to the prior fiscal year absg’s revenue growth was affected primarily by declining anemia drug sales and by one of its large customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in october 2007 the former customer contributed approximately 800 million to absg’s revenue in fiscal 2007 the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals primarily injectibles to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg also distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products 

  26 

revenue related to the distribution of anemiarelated products which represented approximately 58 of pharmaceutical distribution’s total revenue in fiscal 2008 decreased approximately 23 from the prior fiscal year the decline in sales of anemiarelated products since the second half of fiscal 2007 was most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment sales of oncology anemiarelated products represented approximately 22 of total revenue in fiscal 2008 and decreased approximately 32 from the prior fiscal year several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use 

gross profit of 20 billion in fiscal 2008 decreased 8 from the prior fiscal year as a percentage of total revenue gross profit in fiscal 2008 was 292 a decrease of 46 basis points from the prior fiscal year these declines were related to the other segment as the prior year’s consolidated results included 3071 million of gross profit from the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 2007 spinoff date the other segment gross profit decrease was offset in part by the 9 increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s gross profit in fiscal 2008 primarily due to revenue growth growth of our generic programs the acquisition of bellco and strong brandname manufacturer price appreciation fiscal 2008 gross profit benefited from gains of 132 million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer an independent retail group purchasing organization and a major competitor and an 86 million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier and was offset in part by an 84 million inventory writedown of certain pharmacy dispensing equipment fiscal 2007 gross profit was impacted by absg’s 278 million charge relating to the writedown of tetanusdiptheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value in fiscal 2008 and 2007 we recognized gains of 35 million and 358 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these gains which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 02 and 16 of gross profit in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin first out “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 211 million and 22 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the fiscal 2008 lifo charge reflects greater brandname supplier price inflation which more than offset the impact of price deflation of generic drugs during fiscal 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior fiscal year the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million 

consolidated operating expenses of 12 billion in fiscal 2008 decreased by 15 from the prior fiscal year this decline was related to the other segment as the prior year’s consolidated results included 2821 million of operating expenses from the operating results of longterm care and was partially offset by operating expenses of our recent acquisitions primarily those of bellco pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses in fiscal 2008 increased by 5 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily related to the operating expenses of our recent acquisitions primarily those of bellco additionally pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses in fiscal 2008 were impacted by abdc impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling 108 million primarily due to abdc’s decision to abandon the use of certain software which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses in fiscal 2008 were also impacted by a 53 million writedown of intangible assets related to certain smaller business units as a percentage of total revenue pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses in fiscal 2008 decreased 3 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to improvements in operating leverage primarily in abdc where operating expenses declined despite an increase in total revenue due to a more streamlined organizational structure within abdc and absg and the cost savings achieved resulting from our ce2 initiative 

the following table illustrates the charges incurred relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other which are excluded from the operating expenses of the pharmaceutical distribution segment for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 in thousands 

 

in fiscal 2008 we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative “ce2” designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness in connection with these efforts we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions in fiscal 2008 we terminated approximately 130 employees and incurred 100 million of employee severance costs relating to the aforementioned efforts 

  27 

in fiscal 2007 we completed our integration plan to consolidate our distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions the plan included building six new facilities closing 31 facilities and outsourcing a significant amount of our information technology activities in fiscal 2008 we reversed 10 million of employee severance charges previously estimated and recorded related to this integration plan 

in fiscal 2006 we incurred a charge of 139 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employmentrelated dispute with a former bergen brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 in october 2007 we received a favorable ruling from a california appellate court reversing certain portions of the prior adverse decision as a result we reduced our liability in fiscal 2007 to the bergen brunswig chief executive officer by 104 million see bergen brunswig matter under note 13 of notes to the consolidated financial statements the fiscal 2007 compensation expense reduction was recorded as a component of facility consolidations and employee severance 

costs related to business divestitures in fiscal 2008 and 2007 related to pmsi and the longterm care spinoff respectively 

in fiscal 2007 we recognized a 31 million gain relating to the sale of certain retail pharmacy assets of our former longterm care business 

we paid a total of 68 million and 207 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs in fiscal year 2008 and 2007 respectively employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not in excess of 12 months or in the form of a lumpsum payment 

operating income of 8279 million in fiscal 2008 increased 5 from the prior fiscal year due to the 15 or 1068 million increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operating income which was offset in part by a decrease of 323 million in gains from antitrust litigation settlements and an increase of 103 million in facility consolidation employee severance and other costs additionally the prior fiscal year benefited from a 250 million contribution from longterm care prior to its july 2007 spinoff as a percentage of total revenue operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year despite pharmaceutical distribution’s operating income as a percentage of total revenue increasing by 7 basis points this increase was due to the improvements in the gross profit and operating expense margins of the pharmaceutical distribution segment the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements decreased operating income by 89 million in fiscal 2008 and reduced operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 1 basis point the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 338 million to operating income in fiscal 2007 and increased operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 5 basis points longterm care’s operating income in fiscal 2007 increased operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 4 basis points 

other loss of 20 million and 30 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively primarily related to otherthantemporary impairment losses incurred with respect to equity investments 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were as follows in thousands 

 

interest expense was relatively consistent when compared to the prior fiscal year as an increase of 852 million in average borrowings was offset by the decline in the weighted average interest rate interest income decreased substantially from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline in average invested cash and shortterm investments from 9762 million during the prior fiscal year to 3095 million during fiscal 2008 

the decrease in invested cash and shortterm investments from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our use of cash for share repurchases acquisitions and capital expenditures all of which in the aggregate exceeded our net cash provided by operating activities since the prior fiscal year 

income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of 384 versus 370 in the prior fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the company having benefited less in the current year from taxfree investment income 

  28 

income from continuing operations of 4691 million in fiscal 2008 decreased 1 from 4748 million in the prior fiscal year the 5 increase in 2008 operating income was offset by the increase in net interest expense and the increase in the effective income tax rate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 144 increased 14 from 126 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the decline in income from continuing operations was due to the 14 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements decreased income from continuing operations by 55 million and decreased diluted earnings per share by 002 in fiscal 2008 the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 170 million to income from continuing operations and 005 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 additionally the inclusion of longterm care’s operating results in fiscal 2007 increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 004 

the loss from discontinued operations of 2185 million net of income taxes relates to the pmsi business which was sold in october 2008 the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2008 includes a 2249 million charge net of income taxes recorded to reduce the carrying value of pmsi loss from discontinued operations of 56 million net of income taxes in fiscal 2007 included a 246 million charge net of income taxes incurred by us related to an adverse court ruling with respect to a contingent purchase price adjustment in connection with the 2003 acquisition of bridge medical inc “bridge” substantially all of the assets of the bridge business were sold in july 2005 the aforementioned charge in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset by income from discontinued operations relating to the pmsi business 

other 

the other reportable segment includes the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 2007 spinoff date the operating results of pmsi which was sold in october 2008 have been reclassified to discontinued operations 

intersegment eliminations 

these amounts represent the elimination of the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s sales to the other segment abdc was the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to the other segment 

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts we consider a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends and our customers’ financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise we write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 2008 and 2007 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2009 and 2008 was 318 million and 276 million respectively bad debt expense for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 was 485 million which included longterm care’s bad debt expense of 176 million an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2009 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 40 million 

  29 

supplier reserves 

we establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us we evaluate the amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2009 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 85 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from our estimate 

loss contingencies 

an estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events we regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 75 and 78 of our inventories at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively has been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if we had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 1911 million and 1760 higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2009 and 2008 respectively we recorded a lifo charge of 151 million 211 million and 22 million in fiscal 2009 2008 and 2007 respectively during the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million and increase diluted earnings per share by 001 

business combinations 

the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill we engage thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements patents and software technology are amortized over their useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives a determination of the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit andor the component of the entity being valued we are required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value “impairment indicators” this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of our market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management in fiscal 2009 due to the existence of impairment indicators at us bioservices a specialty pharmacy company within the company’s specialty group we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy’s trade name as of june 30 2009 which resulted in an impairment charge of 89 million in fiscal 2008 pmsi experienced certain customer losses and learned that it would lose its largest customer at the end of calendar 2008 as a result and after considering other factors we committed to a plan to divest pmsi we performed an interim impairment test of our pmsi reporting unit and determined that its goodwill was impaired therefore pmsi wroteoff the carrying value of its goodwill of 1991 million in addition we also recognized charges of 267 million to record the estimated loss on the sale of pmsi see note 4 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements we completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 and 2008 and as a result recorded 16 million and 53 million of impairment charges respectively our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 

  30 

sharebased compensation 

we utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option future volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

income taxes 

our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

we have established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

during fiscal 2008 we adopted accounting standards codification “asc” 740 “income taxes” formerly referenced as fasb financial interpretation no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes — an interpretation of fasb statement no 109” which changed the framework for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position 

we have established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of our assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1 on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 82 million in fiscal 2009 

  31 

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates our debt structure at september 30 2009 including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 

 

along with our cash balances our aggregate availability under our revolving credit facilities and our receivables securitization facility provides us sufficient sources of capital to fund our working capital requirements 

in november 2009 we issued 400 million of 4 7  8  senior notes due november 15 2019 the “2019 notes” the 2019 notes were sold at 99174 of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 498 interest on the 2019 notes is payable semiannually in arrears commencing may 15 2010 the 2019 notes rank pari passu to the multicurrency revolving credit facility and the 2012 notes and the 2015 notes all defined below we used the net proceeds of the 2019 notes to repay substantially all amounts outstanding under our multicurrency revolving credit facility and the remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2019 notes will be deferred and amortized over the 10year term of the notes 

we have a 695 million multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility which expires in november 2011 the “multicurrency revolving credit facility” with a syndicate of lenders this amount reflects the reduction of 55 million in availability under the facility as a result of the september 2008 bankruptcy of lehman commercial paper inc interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and ranges from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable 40 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee at september 30 2009 additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate we pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on our debt rating ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment 10 basis points at september 30 2009 we may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test as well as others that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales 

in april 2009 we amended our receivables securitization facility “receivables securitization facility” electing to reduce the amount available under the facility from 975 million to 700 million and extend the expiration date to april 2010 we continue to have an accordion feature available to us whereby the commitment on the receivables securitization facility may be increased by up to 250 million subject to lender approval for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper plus a program fee we pay a commitment fee to maintain the availability under the receivables securitization facility the program fee and the commitment fee were 150 basis points and 75 basis points respectively at september 30 2009 at september 30 2009 there were no borrowings outstanding under the receivables securitization facility in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility we use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources we securitize our trade accounts which are generally noninterest bearing the agreement governing the receivables securitization facility contains restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness making of certain restricted payments issuance of preferred stock creation of certain liens and certain corporate acts such as mergers consolidations and sale of substantially all assets 

  32 

in april 2009 we amended the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility the “blanco credit facility” to among other things extend the maturity date of the blanco credit facility to april 2010 borrowings under the blanco credit facility are guaranteed by us in connection with the april 2009 amendment interest on borrowings under this facility increased from 55 basis points over libor to 200 basis points over libor additionally we are required to pay quarterly facility fees of 50 basis points on any unused portion of the facility the blanco credit facility is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2009 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

we have outstanding 400 million of 5 5  8  senior notes due september 15 2012 the “2012 notes” and 500 million of 5 7  8  senior notes due september 15 2015 the “2015 notes” the 2012 notes and 2015 notes each were sold at 995 of principal amount and have an effective yield of 571 and 594 respectively interest on the 2012 notes and the 2015 notes is payable semiannually in arrears 

our operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of our common stock 

deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers in addition volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth our profitability and our cash flow from operations 

in september 2008 one of our lenders under the multicurrency revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy and as a result our availability under this facility was reduced by 55 million to 695 million we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our lenders and while we do not currently anticipate the failure of any additional lenders under our revolving credit facilities andor under the liquidity facilities of our receivables securitization facility the failure of any further lenders could have an adverse effect on our ability to finance our business operations 

our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of our common stock finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures including our business transformation project and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities in november 2008 our board of directors approved a program allowing us to purchase up to 500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions we purchased 4500 million of our common stock in fiscal 2009 of which 4319 million was purchased under the abovementioned program and 181 million was purchased to close out the may 2007 share repurchase program as of september 30 2009 we had 681 million of availability remaining on our 500 million share repurchase program in november 2009 our board of directors approved a new program authorizing us to purchase up to 500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions we expect to purchase approximately 350 million of our common stock in fiscal 2010 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements 

following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other commitments at september 30 2009 in thousands 

 

the 55 million blanco credit facility which expires in april 2010 is included in the “within 1 year” column in the above table however this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2009 because we have the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

we have commitments to purchase product from influenza vaccine manufacturers through june 30 2015 we are required to purchase annual doses at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements as amended will be approximately 2702 million as of september 30 2009 these influenza vaccine commitments are included in “other commitments” in the above table 

  33 

we have commitments to purchase blood products from suppliers through december 31 2012 we are required to purchase quantities at prices that we believe will represent market prices we currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be approximately 4216 million as of september 30 2009 these blood product commitments are included in “other commitments” in the above table 

we have outsourced to ibm global services “ibm” a significant portion of our corporate and abdc information technology activities and in fiscal 2009 expanded and amended our relationship by engaging ibm to provide assistance with the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning “erp” platform the remaining commitment under our tenyear arrangement as amended which expires in june 2015 is approximately 1348 million and is included in “other commitments” in the above table 

our liability for uncertain tax positions was 544 million as of september 30 2009 this liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty the estimated liability has been excluded from the contractual obligations table on page 33 

during fiscal 2009 our operating activities provided 7838 million of cash as compared to cash provided of 7371 million in the prior fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2009 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 5119 million noncash items of 2540 million and an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 12596 million offset in part by an increase in merchandise inventories of 7650 million and an increase in accounts receivable of 4578 million noncash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of 843 million which primarily related to income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories the increase in accounts receivable merchandise inventories and accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes all principally related to our 12 revenue growth in the month of september 2009 in comparison to the prior year month additionally our merchandise inventory and related accounts payable balances were also impacted by inventory purchases of approximately 400 million in the month of september 2009 primarily relating to the purchase of generic products due to a recent product launch and purchases made in advance of a manufacturer’s temporary plant shutdown in connection with its facility consolidation efforts the average number of days sales outstanding in fiscal 2009 decreased to 181 days from 187 days in fiscal 2008 primarily due to favorable customer mix within abdc the number of average inventory days on hand in fiscal 2009 and 2008 was consistent at 25 days additionally the number of average days payable outstanding in fiscal 2009 and 2008 was relatively consistent at 328 days and 326 days respectively operating cash uses during fiscal 2009 included 569 million in interest payments and 1929 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

during fiscal 2008 our operating activities provided 7371 million of cash as compared to cash provided of 12079 million in the prior fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2008 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 4691 million noncash items of 2181 million and an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 537 million noncash items included the provision for deferred income taxes of 621 million which was significantly higher than the prior fiscal year due to the increase in income tax deductions associated with merchandise inventories merchandise inventories increased slightly despite the 7 increase in total revenue as the number of average inventory days on hand decreased by 2 days compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the continued benefits achieved from the consolidation of our distribution network and strong inventory management accounts receivable declined by 87 million from the prior fiscal year compared to the increase in sales as average days sales outstanding declined from 194 days in fiscal 2007 to 187 days in fiscal 2008 due to changes in customer mix including the july 1 2008 sales reduction with a large chain customer additionally abdc which has lower average days sales outstanding than absg grew faster than absg in fiscal 2008 accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes grew less than revenues due to the reversal of favorable timing at the end of fiscal 2007 average days payable outstanding in fiscal 2008 declined by 1  2 of one day from the prior fiscal year operating cash uses during fiscal 2008 included 685 million in interest payments and 2629 million of income tax payments net of refunds 

during fiscal 2007 our operating activities provided 12079 million of cash as compared to cash provided of 8073 million in the prior fiscal year net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal 2007 was principally the result of income from continuing operations of 4748 million noncash items of 1869 million an increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes of 5076 million and a decrease in merchandise inventories of 2861 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 2360 million the increase in accounts payable accrued expenses and income taxes was primarily driven by the increase in sales and days payable outstanding days payable outstanding in fiscal 2007 increased by 2 days from the prior fiscal year due to favorable timing of payments to our suppliers and the strong growth of absg which has a higher days payable outstanding ratio than abdc because certain of absg’s businesses have more favorable payment terms with their suppliers the inventory turnover rate for the pharmaceutical distribution segment improved to 136 times in fiscal 2007 from 122 times in the prior fiscal year the number of inventory days on hand decreased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to the benefits resulting from having completed our integration plan to consolidate the abdc distribution network and the strong growth of absg’s business which has lower inventory days on hand requirements after several years of consolidation activity the 26 us abdc distribution facilities in fiscal 2007 provided a stable distribution network environment which combined with strong inventory management resulted in a significant reduction in safety stock inventory the increase in accounts receivable was due to the increase in operating revenue and an increase in average days sales outstanding for the pharmaceutical distribution segment average days sales outstanding for the pharmaceutical distribution segment increased to 188 days in fiscal 2007 from 167 days in the prior fiscal year this increase was largely driven by the abovemarket rate growth of the specialty group which generally has a higher receivable investment than the abdc distribution business operating cash uses during fiscal 2007 included 659 million in interest payments and 2532 million of income tax payments net of refunds

market risk 

our most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates relating to our debt we manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2009 we had 2795 million of variable rate debt outstanding the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements we periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to us there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2009 

we also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents we had 10 billion in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2009 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 10 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by 01 million 

we are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our nonus operations our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the canadian dollar we may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates such contracts generally have durations of less than one year we had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september 30 2009 we may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes 

recent accounting pronouncements 

on july 1 2009 we adopted accounting standards update “asu” no 20091 “topic 105 — generally accepted accounting principles” which amended accounting standards codification “asc” 105 “generally accepted accounting principles” to establish the codification as the source of authoritative gaap recognized by the fasb to be applied by nongovernmental entities rules and interpretive releases of the sec under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative gaap for sec registrants on the effective date the codification superseded all thenexisting nonsec accounting and reporting standards all previous references to the superseded standards in our consolidated financial statements have been replaced by references to the applicable sections of the codification the adoption of these sections did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we adopted asc 82010 “fair value measurements and disclosures” formerly referenced as sfas no 157 “fair value measurements” which defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements this new accounting standard did not require any new fair value measurements 

asc 82010 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price asc 82010 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 2 inputs are observable other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities level 3 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at september 30 2009 we had 9283 million of investments in a money market account which was valued as a level 1 investment 

effective october 1 2009 we will apply the provisions of asc 82010 to fair value measurements relating to all nonfinancial assets and liabilities such as goodwill and other intangible assets that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis this adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or liquidity 

  36 

during the first quarter of fiscal 2009 we adopted asc 82510 “financial instruments” formerly referenced as sfas no 159 “the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 115” which allows companies to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value we have not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments not already required to be measured at fair value 

on june 30 2009 we adopted asc 85510 “subsequent events” which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued we evaluated subsequent events through the date and time our financial statements were issued on november 25 2009 

effective october 1 2009 we will adopt the applicable sections of asc 805 “business combinations” which provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree of a business combination additionally this asc provides disclosure requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination we will also adopt certain other applicable sections that address application issues raised on the initial recognition and measurement subsequent measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities from contingencies from a business combination the application of asc 805 relating to an acquisition or divestiture subsequent to september 30 2009 may have an impact to our financial condition andor results of operations

as used herein the terms “company” “amerisourcebergen” “we” “us” or “our” refer to amerisourcebergen corporation a delaware corporation 

amerisourcebergen corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies with operations in the united states canada and the united kingdom servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel we provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers in the united states and canada including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities physicians medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers we also provide pharmaceuticals and pharmacy services to specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmaceutical packaging pharmacy automation supply management software inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and physician education 

industry overview 

over the last several years we have benefited from the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states in fiscal 2008 our total revenue increased by 7 according to ims healthcare inc “ims” an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales in the united states are expected to grow between 1 and 2 in 2009 and between 3 and 6 during the fiveyear period ending 2012 ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals would grow faster than the overall market 

the factors contributing to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals age 55 and over in the united states is projected to increase to more than 75 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widelyused brandname pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years in addition increased emphasis by managed care organizations to utilize generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brandname products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat 

  

diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

legislative developments in recent years regulation of the healthcare industry has changed significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs these changes included expansion of medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs the enrollment beginning in 2006 of medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities and cuts in medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates in addition the us congress may take action in the future to modify medicare and medicaid drug payment policy these policies and other legislative developments may affect our businesses directly andor indirectly see government regulation on page 7 for further details

in an effort to supplement our organic growth we continue to utilize a disciplined approach to seek acquisitions that will assist us with our strategic growth plans 

in october 2007 we acquired bellco health “bellco” a privately held new york distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals for a purchase price of 1622 million net of cash acquired bellco is a pharmaceutical distributor in the metro new york city area where it primarily services independent retail community pharmacies the acquisition of bellco expanded the company’s presence in this large community pharmacy market nationally bellco markets and sells generic pharmaceuticals to individual retail pharmacies and provides pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics bellco’s revenues were 21 billion in fiscal 2008 the dialysisrelated business now is operated as part of our specialty pharmaceuticals business as described below 

 

 our specialty services businesses help pharmaceutical manufacturers especially in the biotechnology sector commercialize their products in the channel we believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies to launch drugs with targeted populations and support the products in the channel we also provide physician education services third party logistics and specialty pharmacy services to help speed products to market 

we continue to seek to expand our offerings in specialty distribution and services 

most recently our acquisition of bellco as noted above allowed us to significantly increase our sales of pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics in fiscal 2008 

in fiscal 2007 we acquired three specialty services businesses beginning with igg of america inc “igg” a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in the blood derivative 

  

intravenous immunoglobulin “ivig” we also acquired access md inc “access md” a canadian company that provides reimbursement support and nursing support services for manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals such as injectable and biological therapies access md expands our specialty services businesses into canada and complements the distribution services offered by amerisourcebergen canada lastly we acquired xcenda llc “xcenda” a consulting business that provides additional capabilities within pharmaceutical brand services applied health outcomes and biopharma strategies 

 

 in october 2008 we sold pmsi our workers’ compensation business which had total revenues and a loss before income taxes of approximately 404 million and 216 million respectively in fiscal 2008 

on july 31 2007 the company and kindred healthcare inc “kindred” completed the spinoffs and subsequent combination of their institutional pharmacy businesses pharmerica longterm care “longterm care” and kindred pharmacy services “kps” to form a new independent publicly traded company named pharmerica corporation “pmc” the company’s and kindred’s stockholders each owned approximately 50 percent of pmc immediately after the closing of the transaction 

operations 

operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers our operations as of september 30 2008 were comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and other the other reportable segment includes the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 2007 spinoff date the operating results of pmsi which was sold in october 2008 have been reclassified to discontinued operations 

during fiscal 2008 the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment was comprised of four operating segments which included the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” or “specialty group” bellco health “bellco” and amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” or “packaging group” we recently completed our integration of bellco’s separate operations within abdc and absg and as of september 30 2008 the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment was comprised of three operating segments which included abdc absg and abpg servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brandname and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics longterm care and other alternate site pharmacies and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management staffing and other consulting services scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 

absg through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers including dialysis clinics absg also distributes vaccines other injectables plasma and other blood products in addition through its specialty services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization services third party logistics group purchasing and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as reimbursement consulting data analytics practice management and physician education as previously noted the dialysisrelated business of bellco has been integrated within absg as of september 30 2008 

  

abpg consists of american health packaging anderson packaging “anderson” and brecon pharmaceuticals limited “brecon” american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers american health packaging’s largest customer is abdc and as a result its operations are closely aligned with the operations of abdc anderson is a leading provider of contract packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers brecon is a united kingdombased provider of contract packaging and clinical trial materials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

sales and marketing abdc has a sales force organized regionally and specialized by healthcare provider type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdc’s national marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdc’s sales and marketing organization also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our specialty and packaging groups each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings 

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physician offices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotech manufacturers of prescribed pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers in fiscal 2008 total revenue for our pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of 68 institutional customers and 32 retail customers 

in fiscal 2008 medco health solutions inc our largest customer accounted for 17 of our total revenue no other individual customer accounted for more than 10 of our fiscal 2008 total revenue our top ten customers represented approximately 42 of fiscal 2008 total revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 7 of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 was derived from our two largest gpo relationships novation and premier the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2008 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2008 accounted for approximately 54 of our purchases 

information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized system abdc’s operating system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels 

  

abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc continues to implement a new warehouse operating system which has improved its productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology as of september 30 2008 approximately 91 of abdc’s transactional volume is generated from our distribution facilities that have successfully implemented the new warehouse operating system 

in an effort to maintain and improve our information technology infrastructure in 2005 we outsourced a significant portion of our information technology activities relating to abdc and corporate functions to ibm global services 

abdc plans to continue to make system investments to further improve its information capabilities and meet its customer and operational needs for example we began to make significant investments in fiscal 2008 relating to our business transformation project that will include a new enterprise resource planning “erp” platform which will be implemented throughout abdc and our corporate functions as well as the development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance our business practices and lower costs we expect to continue to make significant investments in our business transformation project through fiscal 2011 

absg operates the majority of its business on its own common centralized platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the past few years absg has enhanced its web capabilities such that a significant amount of orders are initiated via the internet 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest national competitors are cardinal health inc “cardinal” and mckesson corporation “mckesson” abdc competes with both cardinal and mckesson as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absg’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including mckesson fff enterprises henry schein inc medpath express scripts inc us oncology inc covance inc and ups logistics among others in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment our medication and supply dispensing equipment and certain warehousing equipment we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

  

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2008 we had approximately 10900 employees of which approximately 9700 were fulltime employees approximately 4 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various state and federal governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of state and federal laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase storage andor distribution of pharmaceutical products including controlled substances wholesale distributors of controlled substances are required to hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of applicable laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these laws and regulations we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements needed to conduct our operations 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and the stark law the antikickback statute and the related regulations prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service or to induce the purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services to certain entities with which they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation absg’s operations are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain aspects of abdc’s operations 

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel these laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit diverted adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system for example florida and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by information tracing drugs back to the manufacturers california has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using electronic pedigrees although the effective date has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers these and other requirements are expected to increase our cost of operations at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the fda 

  

regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to the company of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the federal court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed this injunction on july 10 2008 we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding these laws and regulations could increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our distribution business and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as radio frequency identification and other technologies the fda must develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

medicare and medicaid 

the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” instituted an “average sales price” or “asp” methodology beginning in 2005 for medicare part b reimbursed drugs under medicare part b physicians have the option of continuing to obtain drugs under the traditional “buy and bill” approach and being reimbursed for the drugs at asp6 or acquiring drugs through a competitive acquisition program or cap physicians who participate in cap bill the medicare program only for drug administration while the cap vendor bills medicare for the actual cap drug and collects applicable beneficiary copayments we are not a cap vendor and an insignificant number of our physician customers have elected to participate in the cap to date on september 10 2008 the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” announced that the 2009 cap is being postponed indefinitely therefore cap drugs will not be available from an approved cap vendor for dates of service after december 31 2008 

in december 2007 president bush signed the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 into law among other things the law requires cms to adjust medicare part b drug asp calculations to use volumeweighted asps based on actual sales volume effective april 1 2008 in the future this change could reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs which may indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in declines in our profitability 

the mma also significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the new medicare part d program beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in outpatient prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beneficiaries who participate select from a range of standalone prescription drug plans or medicare advantage managed care plans that include prescription drug coverage along with other medicare services “part d plans” the part d plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies each part d plan negotiates reimbursement for part d drugs with pharmaceutical manufacturers 

  

the new part d plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on our revenues and profitability 

the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 “mippa” enacted july 15 2008 establishes timeframes for part d plan payments to pharmacies and longterm care pharmacy submission of claims requires more frequent updating by part d plan sponsors of the drug pricing data they use to pay pharmacies modifies statutory provisions regarding coverage of certain “protected classes” of drugs limits certain part d sales and marketing activities and makes other part d reforms 

effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals which is usually the average wholesale price to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price or amp on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing certain provisions of the amp rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program the order also enjoined cms from disclosing amp data to states and other entities in addition mippa delayed the implementation of these changes until october 1 2009 the use of an amp benchmark may result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect our results of operations 

president bush’s fiscal year 2009 budget proposal released february 4 2008 contained a series of proposals impacting medicare and medicaid including a proposal to further reduce the medicaid federal upper limit reimbursement for multiple source drugs to 150 percent of the amp and replace the “best price” component of the medicaid drug rebate formula with a budgetneutral flat rebate many of the proposed policy changes would require congressional approval to implement there can be no assurances that future revisions to medicare or medicaid payments if enacted will not have an adverse impact on our business 

the federal government may take action in the future to increase the medicaid drug rebate amount for branded pharmaceuticals amend the medicare asp calculation methodology or otherwise modify medicaremedicaid drug payment policy 

see “risk factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and its accompanying federal regulations set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information in addition our operations depending on their location may be subject to additional state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of hipaa standards and other such laws we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals cardinal and mckesson national generic distributors regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers that distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies see “competition” in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation if this trend continues among our customers and suppliers it could give the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power which may lead to greater pressure to reduce prices for our products and services 

our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices 

as part of our transition to feeforservice some distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result approximately 15 of our gross profit from brandname manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of price appreciation if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition we distribute generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the united states and other countries where we do business deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability interest rate fluctuations financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced declining economic conditions may also increase our costs if the economic conditions in the united states or in the regions outside the united states where we do business do not improve or continue to deteriorate our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected 

  

our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by the current levels of financial market volatility and disruption which are unprecedented 

the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than 12 months recently the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels in some cases the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers’ underlying financial strength if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect which may be material on our ability to access credit generally and on our business liquidity financial condition and results of operations 

our receivables securitization facility expires in calendar 2009 while we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of september 30 2008 we have historically utilized amounts available to us under this facility throughout the year to meet our business needs in fiscal 2009 we will seek to renew this facility at available market rates which we believe will be higher than the interest rates currently available to us while we believe we will be able to renew this facility there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 

our total revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

our largest customer medco health solutions inc accounted for 17 of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 our top ten customers represented approximately 42 of fiscal 2008 total revenue we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 7 of our total revenue in fiscal 2008 was derived from our two largest gpo relationships novation and premier we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our total revenue and results of operations 

our total revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured the continued volatility of the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2008 the largest trade receivable balance due from a single customer which was our largest customer represented approximately 9 of accounts receivable net 

  

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers the continued volatility of the capital and credit markets may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example the florida prescription drug pedigree laws and regulations that became effective in july 2006 imposed obligations upon us to deliver prescription drug pedigrees to various categories of customers in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays other states have adopted laws and regulations that would require us to implement pedigree capabilities in those other states similar to the pedigree capabilities implemented for florida for example california has enacted a law requiring the implementation of costly track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification “rfid” technologies although the effective date of the law has been postponed until january 1 2015 for pharmaceutical manufacturers and until july 1 2016 for pharmaceutical wholesalers and repackagers at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the prescription drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of certain provisions of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors the federal court of appeals for the second circuit affirmed this injunction on july 10 2008 we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the fda must develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010 the increased costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations 

the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

the dea fda and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances we are required to hold valid dea and statelevel licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with the controlled substance act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale marketing packaging holding and distribution of controlled substances the dea fda and state 

  

regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers’ licenses to distribute pharmaceutical products including controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations 

on april 24 2007 the dea suspended our orlando florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals alleging that the distribution center did not maintain effective controls against diversion of controlled substances to certain internet pharmacies on june 22 2007 we signed an agreement with the dea which led to the reinstatement of our orlando florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals effective august 25 2007 as required by the agreement we implemented an enhanced and more sophisticated ordermonitoring program in all of our abdc distribution centers by june 30 2007 in addition in june 2007 one of our subsidiaries bellco drug corp entered into a consent judgment with the dea following the suspension of bellco drug’s dea license in may 2007 prior to our acquisition of the business the dea had alleged that bellco drug had failed to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances as required by federal law in the consent judgment bellco drug voluntarily surrendered its dea registration with leave to apply for a new registration bellco drug received its new dea registration on february 12 2008 and resumed distribution of controlled substances while we expect to continue to comply with all of the dea’s requirements there can be no assurance that the dea will not require further controls against the diversion of controlled substances in the future or will not take similar action against any other of our distribution centers in the future 

legal and regulatory changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts from which we derive profit based upon reimbursement rates and methodologies in place at the time such contracts were entered into many of these contracts cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such legal and regulatory changes accordingly such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts until the end of the applicable contract periods 

absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by changes in medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower growth or lower revenues for absg 

the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” was intended to reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately 11 billion over five years effective january 1 2007 the dra changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals which is usually the average wholesale price to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price “amp” on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals in december 2007 the united states district court for the district of columbia issued a preliminary injunction that enjoins cms from implementing certain provisions of the amp rule to the extent that it affects medicaid reimbursement rates for retail pharmacies under the medicaid program the order also enjoins cms from disclosing amp data to states and other entities on july 15 2008 congress enacted the medicaid improvements for patients and providers act of 2008 “mippa” mippa delays the adoption of cms’s july 17 2007 rule and prevents cms from publishing amp data until october 1 2009 we expect the use of an amp benchmark to result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on our business unless we are able to 

  

develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes these changes in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect our results of operations 

in december 2007 president bush signed the medicare medicaid and schip extension act of 2007 into law among other things the law requires cms to adjust medicare part b drug average sales price “asp” calculations to use volumeweighed asps based on actual sales volume effective april 1 2008 this change could reduce medicare reimbursement rates for some part b drugs which may indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for pharmaceuticals and result in reductions in our profitability 

president bush’s fiscal year 2009 budget proposal released february 4 2008 contains a series of proposals that affect medicare and medicaid including a proposal to further reduce the upper limit reimbursement for multiple source drugs to 150 of the amp and replace the “best price” component of the medicaid drug rebate formula with a budgetneutral flat rebate many of the proposed policy changes would require congressional approval to implement there can be no assurance that future revisions to medicare or medicaid payments if enacted will not have an adverse impact on our business 

our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use in addition the fda has announced that it is reviewing new clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and may take additional action with regard to these drugs cms has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future also on july 30 2008 cms announced it is considering a review of national medicare coverage policy for these drugs for patients who have cancer or predialysis chronic kidney disease any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues 

first databank inc publishes drug databases that contain drug information and pricing data the pricing data includes average wholesale price or awp which is a pricing benchmark widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers awp is also used to establish the pricing of pharmaceuticals to certain of our pharmaceutical distribution customers in puerto rico first databank is involved in class action litigation concerning the way it calculates awp pricing data on may 29 2008 the plaintiffs and first databank filed an amended settlement following an original proposed settlement in 2006 that would among other things adjust its awp reporting practices for certain prescription drugs by applying a reduced markup factor 20 versus 25 to approximately 1400 national drug codes on june 3 2008 the federal district court overseeing the litigation granted preliminary approval to the revised settlement and subsequently approved the process for class notification the matter is still subject to opposition by others a fairness hearing which has been scheduled for december 17 2008 and final court approval first databank also announced that independent of the settlement it would reduce to 20 the markup on all drugs with a markup higher than 20 and stop publishing awp within two years after the markup changes are implemented we continue to evaluate the potential impact that a proposed settlement could have on the business of our customers and our business if a revised settlement or other resolution of the case is approved we will evaluate the potential impact of such settlement or other resolution on us at that time there can be no assurance that a settlement or other resolution if approved would not have an adverse impact on the business of our customers andor our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities at this time we can provide no assurances that such changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

  

the changing united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in certain medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical sales are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

we have pharmaceutical distribution operations based in canada and provide contract packaging and clinical trials materials services in the united kingdom we may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties a third party service provider ibm is responsible for managing a significant portion of abdc’s information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

risks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 

we are preparing to implement an erp system to handle the business and financial processes within abdc’s operations and our corporate functions erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect 

additionally if the company does not effectively implement the erp system or if the system does not operate as intended it could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and the united kingdom as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

overview 

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 

the company is a pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its pharmacy physician and manufacturer customers which currently are based primarily in the united states and canada the company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers substantially all of the company’s operations are located in the united states and canada the company also has a pharmaceutical packaging operation in the united kingdom 

on july 31 2007 the company completed the spinoff of its former institutional pharmacy business pharmerica longterm care “longterm care” in connection with the spinoff the company continues to distribute pharmaceuticals to and generate cash flows from the disposed institutional pharmacy business the historical operating results of longterm care are not reported as a discontinued operation of the company because of the significance of the continuing cash flows resulting from the pharmaceutical distribution agreement entered into between the disposed component and the company for periods prior to august 1 2007 the company’s operating results include longterm care 

historically the company has evaluated and reported gross profit operating expense and operating income margins as a percentage of operating revenue because the gross profit and operating expenses relating to bulk deliveries were negligible as a majority of this revenue represented direct shipments from manufacturers to customers’ warehouses in fiscal 2008 the company began to transition a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis to an operating revenue basis as a result of a new contract that the company signed with its largest customer as a result the company’s revenue from bulk deliveries in the future will be insignificant to its total revenue and therefore beginning in fiscal 2008 the company began to report gross profit operating expense and operating income margins as a percentage of total revenue refer to summary segment information table on page 28 

acquisition 

on october 1 2007 the company acquired bellco health for a purchase price of 1622 million net of 207 million of cash acquired bellco is a pharmaceutical distributor in the metro new york city area where it primarily services independent retail community pharmacies the acquisition of bellco expanded the company’s presence in this large community pharmacy market nationally bellco markets and sells generic pharmaceuticals to individual retail pharmacies and provides pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics bellco’s revenues were 21 billion in fiscal 2008 

divestiture 

during fiscal 2008 the company committed to a plan to divest its workers’ compensation business pmsi in accordance with the financial accounting standards board’s “fasb’s” statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 144 “accounting for the impairment or disposal of longlived assets” the company classified pmsi’s assets and liabilities as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets and classified pmsi’s operating results and cash flows as discontinued in the consolidated financial statements for the current and prior fiscal years presented previously pmsi was included in the company’s other reportable segment 

in october 2008 the company completed the sale of pmsi for approximately 34 million net of a working capital adjustment including a 19 million subordinated note payable due from pmsi on the fifth anniversary of the closing date the “maturity date” of which 4 million may be payable in october 2010 if pmsi achieves certain revenue targets with respect to its largest customer interest which accrues at an annual rate of 7 will be payable in cash on a quarterly basis if pmsi achieves a defined minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or will be compounded semiannually and paid at maturity additionally if pmsi’s annual net revenue exceeds certain 

  

thresholds through december 2011 the company may be entitled to additional payments of up to 10 million under the subordinated note payable due from pmsi on the maturity date of the note the company recorded a noncash charge of 2258 million in fiscal 2008 to reduce the carrying value of pmsi this charge which is included in the loss from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 was comprised of a 1991 million writeoff of pmsi’s goodwill and a 267 million charge to record the company’s loss on the sale of pmsi the tax benefit recorded in connection with the above charge was minimal as the loss on the sale of pmsi will be treated as a capital loss for income tax purposes and the company does not have significant capital gains to offset the capital loss 

reportable segments 

the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and other the other reportable segment includes the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 2007 spinoff date the operating results of pmsi which was sold in october 2008 have been reclassified to discontinued operations

operating revenue of 675 billion in fiscal 2008 which excludes bulk deliveries increased 10 from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to growth in our pharmaceutical distribution segment particularly within our abdc operating segment and the bellco acquisition additionally in the march 2008 quarter we began to transition a significant amount of business previously conducted on a bulk delivery basis to an operating revenue basis this business transition which contributed 3 of the operating revenue growth for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 resulted from a new contract that we signed with our largest customer 

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites ie drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites ie crossdock shipment bulk deliveries of 27 billion in fiscal 2008 decreased 39 from the prior fiscal year this decline was due to the customer transition discussed above the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products whether the products are dropshipped or shipped crossdock the company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer as a result and in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on our cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and payments by us to our suppliers 

total revenue of 702 billion in fiscal 2008 increased 7 from the prior fiscal year this increase was driven by the pharmaceutical distribution segment which received a 3 contribution from the bellco acquisition 

gross profit of 20 billion in fiscal 2008 decreased 8 from the prior fiscal year this decline was related to the other segment as prior year’s consolidated results included 3071 million of gross profit from the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 spinoff date the other segment gross profit decrease was offset in part by the 9 increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s gross profit for the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 primarily due to revenue growth including the acquisition of bellco in fiscal 2008 and 2007 we recognized gains of 35 million and 358 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these gains which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 02 and 16 of gross profit in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the company is unable to estimate future gains if any it will recognize as a result of antitrust settlements see note 14 to the consolidated financial statements as a percentage of total revenue gross profit in fiscal 2008 decreased 46 basis points from the prior fiscal year which included the operating results of longterm care 

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 12 billion in fiscal 2008 decreased 16 from the prior fiscal year this decline was related to the other segment as prior year’s consolidated results included 2821 million of dsada from the operating results of longterm care and was partially offset by operating expenses of our recent acquisitions primarily those of bellco 

  

the following table illustrates the charges incurred relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 and 2007 in thousands 

 

 in fiscal 2008 the company announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an initiative “ce2” designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness in connection with these efforts the company reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions the company expects to incur the majority of employee severance costs related to the above efforts through december 31 2008 in fiscal 2008 the company terminated approximately 130 employees and incurred 100 million of employee severance costs relating to the aforementioned efforts 

in fiscal 2007 the company completed its integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions the plan included building six new facilities closing 31 facilities and outsourcing a significant amount of its information technology activities in fiscal 2008 the company reversed 10 million of employee severance charges previously estimated and recorded related to this integration plan 

in fiscal 2006 the company incurred a charge of 139 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employmentrelated dispute with a former bergen brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 in october 2007 the company received a favorable ruling from a california appellate court reversing certain portions of the prior adverse decision as a result the company reduced its liability in fiscal 2007 to the bergen brunswig chief executive officer by 104 million see bergen brunswig matter under note 13 of the consolidated financial statements the fiscal 2007 compensation expense reduction was recorded as a component of facility consolidations and employee severance 

costs related to business divestitures in fiscal 2008 and 2007 related to pmsi and the longterm care spinoff respectively 

in fiscal 2007 the company recognized a 31 million gain relating to the sale of certain retail pharmacy assets of its former longterm care business 

the company paid a total of 68 million and 207 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively remaining unpaid amounts of 214 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2008 most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not in excess of 12 months while others may receive a lumpsum payment 

operating income of 8279 million in fiscal 2008 increased 5 from the prior fiscal year due to the 15 or 1068 million increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operating income which was offset in part by a decrease of 323 million in gains from antitrust litigation settlements and an increase of 103 million in facility consolidation employee severance and other costs additionally the prior fiscal year benefited from a 250 million contribution from longterm care prior to its july 2007 spinoff as a percentage of total revenue operating income in fiscal 2008 decreased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year despite 

  

pharmaceutical distribution’s operating income as a percentage of total revenue increasing by 7 basis points the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements decreased operating income by 89 million in fiscal 2008 and reduced operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 1 basis point the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 338 million to operating income in fiscal 2007 and increased operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 5 basis points longterm care’s operating income in fiscal 2007 increased operating income as a percentage of total revenue by 4 basis points 

other loss of 20 million and 30 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively primarily related to otherthantemporary impairment losses incurred with respect to equity investments 

interest expense interest income and their respective weighted average interest rates in fiscal 2008 and 2007 were as follows in thousands 

 

 interest expense was relatively consistent when compared to the prior fiscal year as an increase of 852 million in average borrowings was offset by the decline in the weighted average interest rate interest income decreased substantially from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline of average invested cash and shortterm investments from 9762 million during the prior fiscal year to 3095 million during fiscal 2008 

the decrease in invested cash and shortterm investments from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to our use of cash for share repurchases acquisitions and capital expenditures all of which in the aggregate exceeded our net cash provided by operating activities since the prior fiscal year our net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon our borrowings interest rates and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash 

income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of 384 versus 370 in the prior fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the company having benefited less in the current year from taxfree investment income we expect our effective tax rate going forward will approximate the fiscal 2008 tax rate 

we adopted fasb’s financial interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” effective october 1 2007 the cumulative effect of adoption of this interpretation resulted in a 93 million reduction in retained earnings the adoption of the provisions of fin no 48 did not have a significant impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2008 

income from continuing operations of 4691 million in fiscal 2008 decreased 1 from 4748 million in the prior fiscal year the 5 increase in 2008 operating income was offset by the increase in net interest expense and the increase in the effective income tax rate diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 289 increased 14 from 253 per share in the prior fiscal year the difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the decline in income from continuing operations was due to the 14 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding from purchases of our common stock in connection with our stock repurchase program see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other less the gain on antitrust litigation settlements decreased income from continuing operations by 55 million and decreased diluted earnings per share by 003 in fiscal 2008 the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other 

  

contributed 170 million to income from continuing operations and 009 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 additionally the inclusion of longterm care’s operating results in fiscal 2007 increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 008 

the loss from discontinued operations of 2185 million net of income taxes relates to the pmsi business which was sold in october 2008 the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2008 includes a 2248 million charge net of income taxes recorded to reduce the carrying value of pmsi loss from discontinued operations of 56 million net of income taxes in fiscal 2007 included a 246 million charge net of income taxes incurred by the company related to an adverse court ruling with respect to a contingent purchase price adjustment in connection with the 2003 acquisition of bridge medical inc “bridge” as previously discussed in legal proceedings under item 3 substantially all of the assets of the bridge business were sold in july 2005 the aforementioned charge in fiscal 2007 was substantially offset by income from discontinued operations relating to the pmsi business 

segment information 

pharmaceutical distribution 

pharmaceutical distribution total revenue of 702 billion in fiscal 2008 increased 7 from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the 5 revenue growth of abdc and the acquisition of bellco which contributed 3 of the total revenue increase during fiscal 2008 68 of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 32 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 64 institutional and 36 retail in comparison with the prior fiscal year results sales to institutional customers increased 15 primarily due to the acquisition of bellco the revenue of which is heavily weighted towards institutional customers and the strong growth of certain large customers sales to retail customers decreased 5 primarily due to our decision not to renew a contract effective january 2007 with a large retail customer and the july 1 2008 loss of certain business totaling approximately 30 billion of annual revenue from a large retail drug chain customer 

abdc’s total revenue excluding bellco increased by 5 in fiscal 2008 in comparison to the prior fiscal year this revenue growth was primarily due to the increase in sales to certain of our large institutional customers offset in part by the decline in retail customer revenue as discussed above 

absg’s total revenue excluding bellco of 130 billion in fiscal 2008 increased 3 compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to strong doubledigit growth of its nononcology distribution businesses oncology distribution’s revenue which represents approximately 60 of absg’s total revenue was flat compared to the prior fiscal year absg’s revenue growth was affected primarily by declining anemia drug sales and by one of its large customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in october 2007 the former customer contributed approximately 800 million to absg’s revenue in fiscal 2007 the majority of absg’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals primarily injectibles to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg also distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes to this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 

revenue related to the distribution of anemiarelated products which represented approximately 58 of pharmaceutical distribution’s total revenue in fiscal 2008 decreased approximately 23 from the prior fiscal year the decline in sales of anemiarelated products since the second half of fiscal 2007 has been most pronounced in the use of these products for cancer treatment sales of oncology anemiarelated products represented approximately 22 of total revenue in fiscal 2008 and decreased approximately 32 from the prior fiscal year several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including expanded 

  

warning and other product safety labeling requirements more restrictive federal policies governing medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology patients with kidney failure and dialysis and changes in regulatory and clinical medical guidelines for recommended dosage and use the us food and drug administration “fda” has announced that it is reviewing new clinical study data concerning the possible risks associated with erythropoiesis stimulating agents and may take additional action with regard to these drugs in march 2008 manufacturers of certain anemia products announced further labeling revisions to reflect additional safety information moreover the fda announced on july 30 2008 that it is ordering additional safety labeling changes related to the use of the drugs in the treatment of certain cancers as a result we expect oncologyrelated anemia drug sales to decline further in fiscal 2009 from our fiscal 2008 total cms has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future also on july 30 2008 cms announced it is considering a review of national medicare coverage policy for these drugs for patients who have cancer or predialysis chronic kidney disease further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payors including federal and state governments and private insurance plans our future revenue growth rate andor profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage and or use of anemia drugs 

we currently expect that our total revenue growth in fiscal 2009 will be between 1 and 3 as this range reflects market growth of 12 as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc “ims” the expected strong growth of certain of our large institutional customers primarily within abdc offset in part by the loss of certain business with a national retail chain customer to a competitor effective july 1 2008 sales to this chain customer approximated 30 billion of total revenue in fiscal 2008 the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s expected growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization the introduction of new products and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry sales in the united states as estimated by ims are expected to grow between 1 and 2 in 2008 and 2009 and between 3 and 6 during the fiveyear period ending 2012 ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals would grow faster than the overall market the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors such as competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates changes in federal government rules and regulations industry growth trends such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers and general economic conditions 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 20 billion in fiscal 2008 increased 1674 million or 9 from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to revenue growth growth of our generic programs the acquisition of bellco and strong brandname manufacturer price appreciation as a percentage of total revenue gross profit in fiscal 2008 and 2007 was 291 and 287 respectively fiscal 2008 gross profit benefited from gains of 132 million relating to favorable litigation settlements with a former customer an independent retail group purchasing organization and a major competitor and a 86 million settlement of disputed fees with a supplier and was offset in part by an 84 million inventory writedown of certain pharmacy dispensing equipment fiscal 2007 gross profit was impacted by absg’s 278 million charge relating to the writedown of tetanusdiphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value see mbl matter under note 13 of consolidated financial statements 

our cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences we recorded a lifo charge of 211 million and 22 million in fiscal 2008 and 2007 respectively the fiscal 2008 lifo charge reflects greater brandname supplier price inflation which more than offset the impact of price deflation of generic drugs during fiscal 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation 

  

of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior fiscal year the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million 

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 12 billion in fiscal 2008 increased 607 million or 5 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily related to the operating expenses of our recent acquisitions primarily those of bellco additionally operating expenses in fiscal 2008 were impacted by abdc impairment charges related to capitalized equipment and software development costs totaling 108 million primarily due to abdc’s decision to abandon the use of certain software which will be replaced in connection with our business transformation project operating expenses in fiscal 2008 were also impacted by a 53 million writedown of intangible assets relating to certain smaller business units as a percentage of total revenue operating expenses in fiscal 2008 decreased 3 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to improvements in operating leverage primarily in abdc where operating expenses declined despite an increase in total revenue due to a more streamlined organizational structure within abdc and absg and the cost savings achieved resulting from our ce2 initiative 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 8367 million in fiscal 2008 increased 15 from the prior fiscal year as the increase in gross profit exceeded the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue operating income in fiscal 2008 increased 7 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the improvements in the gross profit and operating expense margins

year ended september 30 2007 compared with year ended september 30 2006 

consolidated results 

operating revenue of 613 billion in fiscal 2007 which excludes bulk deliveries increased 9 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increases in operating revenue in our abdc and absg operating segments both of which are included in the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment our acquisitions contributed 1 of the operating revenue growth in fiscal 2007 

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk deliveries of 44 billion in fiscal 2007 decreased 3 from the prior fiscal year revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

total revenue of 657 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 8 from the prior fiscal year this increase was due to growth in our pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

gross profit of 22 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 5 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the increase in pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue an increase in compensation under its feeforservice agreements and the growth of its generic programs offset in part by a 278 million charge incurred by absg relating to tetanusdiphtheria vaccine inventory and the decline in gross profit of the other segment during fiscal 2007 and 2006 the company recognized gains of 358 million and 409 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers which represented 16 and 19 of gross profit respectively 

dsada of 14 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 1 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth operating expenses of our acquired companies an increase in bad debt expense of 110 million and an increase in sharebased compensation of 81 million all of which was partially offset by a decline in dsada of the other segment and a decline in employee incentive compensation as a percentage of total revenue dsada in fiscal 2007 decreased 14 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in dsada of the other segment resulting from the divestiture of the longterm care business

segment information 

pharmaceutical distribution 

pharmaceutical distribution total revenue of 653 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 8 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by the strong above market 27 revenue growth of absg principally in its distribution businesses abdc grew its total revenue by 4 in comparison to the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2007 64 of total revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 36 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 62 institutional and 38 retail in comparison with the prioryear results sales to institutional customers increased 10 primarily due to the strong growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business sales to retail customers increased 5 as growth in retail chain sales was offset in part by our decision to discontinue servicing the large lower margin customer discussed below 

the abdc total revenue growth rate in fiscal 2007 benefited from increased sales to certain of its large customers and the 1 revenue contribution resulting from the fullyear impact of its 2006 canadian acquisitions abdc’s total revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by the company’s decision not to renew a contract effective january 2007 with a large lowmargin customer that contributed approximately 10 billion of total revenue for abdc in fiscal 2006 and the july 2006 loss of two customer accounts that totaled 12 billion of revenue in fiscal 2006 these customer accounts transitioned to another distributor after they were acquired by a company supplied by that distributor 

absg grew at a rate in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth absg’s total revenue of 126 billion in fiscal 2007 grew 27 from the prior fiscal year the majority of this group’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg’s oncology business continued to outperform the market and was absg’s most significant contributor to revenue growth during fiscal 2007 the oncology business benefited from a semiexclusive distribution agreement that it signed with a large biotechnology manufacturer during the second half of fiscal 2006 and absg’s besse medical business experienced strong growth in fiscal 2007 primarily arising from the distribution of a new physicianadministered ophthalmology product which was introduced in the second half of fiscal 2006 absg also distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products 

approximately 6 of the company’s total revenue in fiscal 2007 related to the distribution of anemiarelated products which are distributed by both abdc and absg several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs during the second half of fiscal 2007 including the decision in march 2007 by the us food and drug administration “fda” to require an expanded warning label on these drugs cms’s review of reimbursement policies for these drugs and restrictions on recommended dosage or use in july 2007 cms issued new more restrictive policies regarding medicare coverage of anemia drugs used in the treatment of oncology patients and for kidney failure and dialysis on november 8 2007 the fda announced revised boxed warnings and other safetyrelated product labeling changes for these drugs addressing the risks posed to patients with cancer or chronic kidney failure cms also has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payers including federal and state governments and private insurance plans 

  

this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization the introduction of new products and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 19 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 9 from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in total revenue an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements and the growth of our generic programs offset in part by competitive pricing pressures and absg’s 278 million charge relating to the writedown of tetanusdiphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value see mbl matter under note 13 of the consolidated financial statements as a percentage of total revenue gross profit in fiscal 2007 increased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences during fiscal 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million 

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 11 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 6 from the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily related to our total revenue growth operating expenses of our acquired companies an increase in bad debt expense of 86 million primarily related to the bankruptcy of a retail chain customer in our west region and an increase in sharebased compensation and was partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation as a percentage of total revenue operating expenses in fiscal 2007 decreased 4 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to economies of scale realized as a result of the increase in operating revenue productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network as a result of our optimiz ® program and a decrease in employee incentive compensation and was partially offset by the increase in bad debt expense and the operating costs of our recently acquired companies 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 7300 million in fiscal 2007 increased 14 from the prior fiscal year as the increase in gross profit exceeded the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue operating income in fiscal 2007 increased 6 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the improvement in the operating expense margin

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts the company considers a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends its customers’ financial strength credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables each of the company’s business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise the company writes off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and the company’s largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2008 2007 and 2006 was 276 million 485 million and 375 million respectively longterm care’s bad debt expense which is included in the above amounts for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 was 176 million and 152 million respectively the bankruptcy of a regional chain customer in abdc’s west region accounted for a significant portion of the increase in bad debt expense from fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2008 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 33 million 

supplier reserves 

the company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the company these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the company the company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2008 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 73 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from the company’s estimate 

loss contingencies 

the company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 “accounting for contingencies” an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

  

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 78 and 79 of the company’s inventories at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively have been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if the company had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 1760 million and 1549 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2008 and 2007 respectively we recorded a lifo charge credit of 211 million 22 million and 10 million in fiscal 2008 2007 and 2006 respectively during the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million and increase diluted earnings per share by 002 

business combinations 

in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill the company engages thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements patents and software technology are amortized over their useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under sfas no 142 a determination of the fair value of the company’s reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit andor the component of the entity being valued the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value “impairment indicators” this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of the company’s market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management in fiscal 2008 pmsi experienced certain customer losses and learned that it would lose its largest customer at the end of calendar 2008 as a result and after considering other factors the company committed to a plan to divest pmsi the company performed an interim impairment test of its pmsi reporting unit and determined that its goodwill was impaired therefore pmsi wroteoff the carrying value of its goodwill of 1991 million in addition it also recognized charges of 267 million to record the estimated loss on the sale of pmsi see note 4 to the consolidated financial statements the company completed its required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of 

  

fiscal 2008 and as a result recorded 53 million of impairment charges the company’s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the company’s future financial results 

sharebased compensation 

the company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option future volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and uncertain tax positions reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

the company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

effective october 1 2007 the company adopted the provisions of fin no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” fin no 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits fin no 48 also provides guidance among other things on the measurement of the income tax benefit associated with uncertain tax positions derecognition classification interest and penalties and financial statement disclosures 

the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under fin no 48 the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business the company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on income from continuing operations before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 76 million in fiscal 2008 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates the company’s debt structure at september 30 2008 including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 

 

 the company’s aggregate availability under its revolving credit facilities and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund the company’s working capital requirements 

the company has a 750 million fiveyear multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “multicurrency revolving credit facility” with a syndicate of lenders in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 one of the lenders lehman commercial paper inc filed for bankruptcy as a result the company’s availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility was reduced by 55 million interest on borrowings under the multicurrency revolving credit facility accrues at specified rates based on the company’s debt rating and ranges from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee as applicable 40 basis points over liboreuriborbankers acceptance stamping fee at september 30 2008 additionally interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate the company pays quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specified rates based on the company’s debt rating ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment 10 basis points at september 30 2008 the company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants that impose limitations on among other things indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales additional covenants require compliance with financial tests including a leverage ratio 

the company has a 975 million receivables securitization facility “receivables securitization facility” of which 1812 million expires in june 2009 and 7938 million expires in november 2009 the company has available to it an accordion feature whereby the commitment may be increased subject to lender approval to 12 billion for seasonal needs during the december and march quarters interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for shortterm commercial paper plus a program fee and vary based on the company’s debt ratings the program fee and the commitment fee on average were 53 basis points and 20 basis points respectively at september 30 2008 at september 30 2008 there were no borrowings under the receivables securitization facility in connection with the receivables securitization facility abdc sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to amerisource receivables financial corporation a wholly owned special purpose entity which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions abdc is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the receivables securitization facility after the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected 

  

additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility the facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the company because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources the company securitizes its trade accounts which are generally noninterest bearing in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings under sfas no 140 “accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities” the agreement governing the receivables securitization facility contains restrictions and covenants which include limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness making of certain restricted payments issuance of preferred stock creation of certain liens and certain corporate acts such as mergers consolidations and sale of substantially all assets 

the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2008 was amended and now expires in april 2009 borrowings under the blanco credit facility are guaranteed by the company interest on borrowings under the blanco credit facility accrues at the specific rates based on the company’s debt rating 55 basis points over libor at september 30 2008 additionally the company pays quarterly facility fees on the full amount of the facility to maintain the availability under the blanco credit facility at specific rates based on the company’s debt rating 10 basis points at september 30 2008 the borrowing is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2008 because the company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

the company has outstanding 400 million of 5 5  8  senior notes due september 15 2012 the “2012 notes” and 500 million of 5 7  8  senior notes due september 15 2015 the “2015 notes” the 2012 notes and 2015 notes each were sold at 995 of principal amount and have an effective yield of 571 and 594 respectively interest on the 2012 notes and the 2015 notes is payable semiannually in arrears both the 2012 notes and the 2015 notes are redeemable at the company’s option at a price equal to the greater of 100 of the principal amount thereof or the sum of the discounted value of the remaining scheduled payments as defined 

in january 2008 the company’s debt rating was raised by one of the rating agencies in accordance with the terms of the multicurrency revolving credit facility and the blanco credit facility interest on borrowings began accruing at lower rates reducing the libor spread and the facility fee on both facilities in july 2008 the company’s debt rating was raised by another rating agency and as a result the company’s senior unsecured debt is now rated investment grade by all three of the primary rating agencies while the july 2008 ratings upgrade does not affect the company’s borrowing rates it will no longer be required to maintain minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios in connection with the multicurrency revolving credit facility 

the company’s operating results have generated cash flow which together with availability under its debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements and to fund capital expenditures acquisitions repayment of debt the payment of interest on outstanding debt dividends and repurchases of shares of the company’s common stock 

recent deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and therefore reduce purchases by our customers in addition interest rate fluctuations and volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations 

recently the credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption as previously mentioned one of our lenders under the multicurrency revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy and as a result our availability under this facility was reduced by 55 million we continue to monitor the creditworthiness of our lenders and while we do not currently anticipate the failure of any additional lenders under our revolving credit facilities andor under the liquidity facilities of our receivables securitization facility the failure of any further lenders could have an adverse effect on our ability to finance our business operations 

  

additionally our receivables securitization facility expires in calendar 2009 while we did not have any borrowings outstanding under this facility as of september 30 2008 we have historically utilized amounts available to us under this facility throughout the year to meet our business needs in fiscal 2009 we will seek to renew this facility at available market rates which we believe will be higher than the interest rates currently available to us while we believe we will be able to renew this facility there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 

the company’s primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital fund the payment of interest on debt fund repurchases of its common stock finance acquisitions and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities for example in october 2007 the company purchased bellco for 1622 million net of 207 million of cash acquired in november 2007 the company’s board of directors authorized an increase to the 850 million share repurchase program by 500 million subject to market conditions during the fiscal year ended september 30 2008 the company purchased 6797 million of its common stock as of september 30 2008 the company had approximately 181 million of availability remaining on its 1350 million share repurchase program in november 2008 the company’s board of directors approved a new program authorizing the company to purchase up to 500 million of its outstanding shares of common stock subject to market conditions the company expects to purchase approximately 350 million of its common stock in fiscal 2009 subject to market conditions future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund the company’s ongoing cash requirements 

following is a summary of the company’s contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on its debt minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases and minimum payments on its other commitments at september 30 2008 in thousands 

 

 the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility which expires in april 2009 is included in the “within 1 year” column in the above repayment table however this borrowing is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2008 because the company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis

market risk 

the company’s most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates the company manages interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the company also has market risk exposure relating to its cash and cash equivalents and its shortterm investment securities 

  

availableforsale at september 30 2008 the company had 2914 million of variablerate debt the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company’s working capital requirements the company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the company there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2008 

the company had 8781 million in cash and cash equivalents at september 30 2008 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the company’s annual net interest expense by 05 million 

the nonus operations of the company are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk the company may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates such contracts generally have durations of less than one year during fiscal 2008 the company’s largest exposures to foreign exchange rates existed primarily with the canadian dollar the company had no foreign currency denominated forward contracts at september 30 2008 the company may use derivative instruments to hedge its foreign currency exposures but not for speculative or trading purposes

 item 1 business 

as used herein the terms “company” “amerisourcebergen” “we” “us” or “our” refer to amerisourcebergen corporation a delaware corporation 

amerisourcebergen corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies with operations in the united states canada and the united kingdom servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel we provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers located in the united states and canada including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies institutional pharmacies mail order facilities physicians medical clinics alternate site facilities and other customers we also provide pharmaceuticals and pharmacy services to workers’ compensation and specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmaceutical packaging pharmacy automation supply management software inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and physician education 

industry overview 

we have benefited from the significant growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states according to ims healthcare inc “ims” an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales in the united states are expected to grow between 4 and 5 in 2008 and between 6 and 9 over the next five years ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty products and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market 

the factors contributing to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals over age 55 in the united states is projected to increase to more than 75 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from chronic illnesses and disabilities more than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry in particular we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of generic pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widelyused brand name pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years in addition increased incentives by managed care organizations to utilize generics has accelerated their growth we consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand name products although their lower prices reduce revenue growth 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we 

  

believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

legislative developments the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals were impacted by implementation of the mma by the us department of health and human services “hhs” further medicare reimbursement reductions and policy changes are scheduled to be implemented in the future in addition effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for certain prescription drugs which is usually the average wholesale price to 250 of the lowest average manufacturer price or amp on july 17 2007 centers for medicare and medicaid services “cms” published final rules to implement these provisions and clarify among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals cms has stated that it expects the federal upper payment limits will become effective for covered outpatient multiple source prescription drugs beginning in january 2008 the us congress may consider further reductions to medicaid reimbursement and may take action before the end of 2007 to modify medicare and medicaid drug payment policy these policies may adversely affect our specialty distribution business directly and our wholesale drug distribution and specialty distribution businesses indirectly 

the company 

we currently serve our customers healthcare providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and some patients through a geographically diverse network of distribution and service centers and other operations in the united states and canada and through packaging facilities in the united states and the united kingdom in our pharmaceutical distribution business we typically are the primary source of supply for pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers we offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations which allows them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel 

strategy 

our business strategy is focused solely on the pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide valueadded distribution and service solutions to healthcare providers primarily pharmacies health systems and physicians and pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase channel efficiencies and improve patient outcomes implementing this disciplined focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business and we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy 

optimize and grow our pharmaceutical distribution and service businesses  we believe we are wellpositioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our distribution business as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies distribution anchors our growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel as we provide superior distribution services and deliver valueadded solutions which improve the efficiency and competitiveness of both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers thus allowing the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients 

with the rapid growth of generic pharmaceuticals in the us market we have introduced strategies to enhance our position in the generic marketplace we source generics globally offer a valueadded generic formulary program to our healthcare provider customers and monitor our customers’ compliance with our generics program we also sell data and other valuable services to our generic manufacturing customers 

  

we believe we have one of the lowest cost operating structures in pharmaceutical distribution among our major competitors we launched our optimiz ® program in fiscal 2001 for amerisourcebergen drug corporation which reduced our distribution facility network in the us from 51 facilities in 2001 to 26 as of september 30 2007 the program which is complete included building six new facilities and closing 31 facilities we closed our final two facilities in fiscal 2007 to complete the plan these measures have reduced our operating costs and our working capital in addition we believe we will continue to achieve productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse automation technology adopt “best practices” in warehousing activities and increase operating leverage by increasing volume per fullservice distribution facility 

in an effort to supplement our organic growth we continue to utilize a disciplined approach to seek acquisitions that will assist us with our strategic growth plans 

in october 2007 the company acquired bellco health “bellco” a privately held new york distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals for a purchase price of approximately 181 million in cash bellco is a pharmaceutical distributor in the metro new york city area where it primarily services independent retail community pharmacies the acquisition of bellco expands the company’s presence in this large community pharmacy market nationally bellco markets and sells generic pharmaceuticals to individual retail pharmacies and provides pharmaceutical products and services to dialysis clinics bellco’s revenues were 21 billion for its fiscal year ended june 30 2007 

in fiscal 2006 we made three acquisitions to expand our distribution and service businesses into canada we acquired trent drugs wholesale ltd “trent” a canadian wholesaler of pharmaceutical products and subsequently changed its name to amerisourcebergen canada corporation “amerisourcebergen canada” which gave us a solid foundation to expand our pharmaceutical distribution capability into the canadian marketplace amerisourcebergen canada then acquired substantially all of the assets of asenda pharmaceutical supplies ltd “asenda” a canadian pharmaceutical distributor that operated primarily in british columbia and alberta the asenda acquisition strengthened our position in western canada thereafter amerisourcebergen canada acquired reppharm inc “reppharm” a canadian pharmaceutical distributor that primarily served retail community pharmacies in the provinces of ontario quebec and alberta the above acquisitions have positioned us as the second largest pharmaceutical distributor in the canadian market 

 

 we expect to continue to expand our specialty services businesses which help pharmaceutical manufacturers especially in the biotechnology sector commercialize their products in the channel we believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies to launch drugs with targeted populations and support the products in the channel we provide physician education services third party logistics and specialty pharmacy services to help speed products to market 

in fiscal 2007 we acquired three specialty services businesses beginning with igg of america inc “igg” a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in the blood derivative intravenous immunoglobulin “ivig” the addition of igg supports our strategy of building our specialty services to manufacturers we also acquired access md inc “amd” a canadian company that provides reimbursement support and nursing support services to manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals such as injectable and biological therapies amd expands our specialty 

  

services businesses into canada and complements the distribution services offered by amerisourcebergen canada lastly we acquired xcenda llc “xcenda” a consulting business that provides additional capabilities within pharmaceutical brand services applied health outcomes and biopharma strategies 

 

 our provider solutions include our good neighbor pharmacy ® program which enables independent community pharmacies to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs good neighbor pharmacy performance network our managed care network which connects our retail pharmacy customers to payor plans throughout the country and is the thirdlargest in the us bestpriced generic product purchasing services hospital pharmacy consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and packaging services that deliver unit dose punch card and other compliance packaging for institutional and retail pharmacy customers we also continue to pursue enhancements to our services and programs 

in fiscal 2007 we acquired health advocates inc “health advocates” a leading provider of medicare setaside cost containment services to insurance payors primarily within the workers’ compensation industry health advocates was renamed pmsi msa services inc “pmsi msa services” and operates under pmsi our workers’ compensation services business the addition of pmsi msa services combined with our leading pharmacy and clinical solutions gives our workers’ compensation business the ability to provide our customers with a fully integrated medicare setaside solution 

 

 on july 31 2007 the company and kindred healthcare inc “kindred” completed the spinoffs and subsequent combination of their institutional pharmacy businesses pharmerica longterm care “longterm care” and kindred pharmacy services “kps” to form a new independent publicly traded company named pharmerica corporation “pmc” at closing longterm care borrowed 125 million from a financial institution and provided a onetime distribution back to the company longterm care and kps were then spun off to the stockholders of their respective parent companies followed immediately by the merger of the two institutional pharmacy businesses into subsidiaries of pmc and the exchange of longterm care and kps shares for pmc shares which resulted in the company’s and kindred’s stockholders each owning approximately 50 percent of pmc immediately after the closing of the transaction 

operations 

operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and other 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” and the amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes 

  

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order pharmacies medical clinics alternate site facilities and other customers abdc also provides pharmacy management consulting services and scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers substantially all of abdc’s operations are in the united states and canada 

absg through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology and to other healthcare providers absg also distributes vaccines other injectibles plasma and other blood products in addition through its specialty services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization services third party logistics group purchasing services and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as reimbursement consulting data analytics practice management and physician education substantially all of absg’s operations are in the united states 

abpg consists of american health packaging anderson packaging “anderson” and brecon pharmaceutical limited “brecon” american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse compliance and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers american health packaging’s largest costumer is abdc and as a result its operations are closely aligned with the operations of abdc anderson is a leading provider of contract packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers brecon is a united kingdombased provider of contract packaging and clinical trial materials “ctm” services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

our other reportable segment includes the operating results of longterm care through the july 31 2007 spinoff date and pmsi subsequent to july 31 2007 the other segment only includes the operating results of pmsi 

pmsi provides mail order and online pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers’ compensation programs and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors pmsi services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and computer software solutions to reduce payors’ administrative costs pmsi also offers medicare setaside cost containment services to its insurance payor customers through pmsi msa services inc 

sales and marketing abdc has a sales force organized regionally and specialized by healthcare provider type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdc’s national marketing organization designs and develops business management solutions for amerisourcebergen healthcare provider customers tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdc’s sales and marketing also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and with the management of the specialty and packaging groups abdc sales and marketing ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our specialty and packaging groups and the pmsi business each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings 

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm and alternate care facility pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities and physician offices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers our 

  

manufacturing customers include branded generic and biotech manufacturers of prescribed pharmaceuticals as well as overthecounter product manufacturers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers during fiscal 2007 operating revenue for our pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of 62 institutional and 38 retail 

in fiscal 2007 medco health solutions inc “medco” our largest customer accounted for 14 of our total revenue 8 of our operating revenue and 90 of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses our secondlargest customer accounted for 8 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2007 other than our two largest customers no individual customer accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2007 operating revenue our top ten customers represented approximately 34 of fiscal 2007 operating revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 8 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2007 was derived from our two largest gpo relationships novation and premier the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future operating revenue and results of operations 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for 10 or more of our purchases in fiscal 2007 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2007 accounted for approximately 60 of our purchases 

in fiscal 2006 working with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners we completed the transition of our branded pharmaceutical distribution business to a feeforservice model where we are primarily compensated for the services we provide manufacturers for a fee under a typical feeforservice agreement we are compensated for our services based on a percentage of purchases over a defined time period with payment of fees being made directly or through a combination of direct payments and price increase entitlements we believe the feeforservice model has improved the efficiency and transparency of the supply channel 

information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on a centralized system abdc’s operating system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the basic and valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc plans to continue to make system investments to further improve its information capabilities and meet its customer and operational needs for example the company recently announced a business transformation project that will include a new erp enterprise resource planning platform which will be selected and implemented throughout abdc and throughout abc’s corporate functions as well as the development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance business best practices and lower cost abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc continues to implement a new warehouse operating system that is expected to improve its productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology as of september 30 2007 approximately 85 of abdc’s transactional volume is generated from our distribution facilities that have successfully implemented the new warehouse operating system 

in an effort to maintain and improve its information technology infrastructure abdc decided to outsource a significant portion of the information technology activities relating to its corporate functions and to its operations and entered into a tenyear commitment effective july 1 2005 with ibm global services which has assumed responsibility for performing the outsourced information technology activities 

  

absg operates the majority of its specialty distribution business on its own common centralized platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the past few years absg has introduced and enhanced its web capabilities such that a significant amount of orders are initiated via the internet 

our pmsi business provides proprietary information technology for workers’ compensation solutions these systems provide eligibility authorization and reimbursement payments to participating pharmacies they also provide order taking shipment and collection of service fees for medications and specialty services the systems also provide billing and reimbursement for other services rendered pmsi continues to invest in technologies that help improve data integrity critical information access and system availability 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services our largest competitors are cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation abdc competes with both cardinal and mckesson as well as regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with manufacturers who sell directly chain drugstores who do their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absg’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including oncology therapeutics network recently acquired by mckesson fff enterprises henry schein inc medpath express scripts inc us oncology inc covance inc and ups logistics among others in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

the pmsi business competes with numerous billing companies in connection with the portion of its business that electronically adjudicates workers’ compensation claims for payors pmsi also competes with various companies that provide home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment pmsi’s primary competitors include coventry health inc fiserv health medical services company cypress medical products and progressive medical inc

employees 

as of september 30 2007 we employed approximately 11300 persons of which approximately 10200 were fulltime employees approximately 4 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good if any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations 

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various state and federal governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of state and federal laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances wholesale distributors of these substances are required to hold valid dea licenses meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing controlled substances seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these laws and regulations we have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and the stark law the antikickback statute and the related regulations prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service or for inducing the purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing leasing or ordering of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services to certain entities with whom they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation absg’s operations are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain aspects of our abdc operations 

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel for example florida and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by information tracing drugs back to the manufacturers these and other requirements are expected to increase our cost of operations at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the pharmaceutical drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to the company of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on february 1 2007 hhs and the fda appealed this decision to the federal court of appeals for the second circuit we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict what reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see “risk factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

medicare and medicaid 

the mma instituted an “average sales price” or “asp” methodology beginning in 2005 for medicare part b reimbursed drugs under medicare part b physicians have the option of continuing to obtain drugs under the traditional “buy and bill” approach and being reimbursed for the drugs at asp6 or acquiring drugs through a competitive acquisition program or cap physicians who participate in cap bill the medicare program only for drug administration while the cap vendor bills medicare for the actual cap drug and collects applicable beneficiary copayments we are not a cap vendor and an insignificant number of our physician customers have elected to participate in the cap to date 

the mma also significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through new medicare part d beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in outpatient prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beneficiaries who participate select from a range of standalone prescription drug plans or medicare advantage managed care plans that include prescription drug coverage along with other medicare services “part d plans” the part d plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies each part d plan negotiates reimbursement for part d drugs with pharmaceutical manufacturers the new part d plan has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel which has a positive impact on the company’s operating revenues and profitability 

effective january 1 2007 the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals which is usually the average wholesale price to 250 of the lowest manufacturer price or amp on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals cms has stated that it expects the federal upper payment limits will become effective for covered outpatient multiple source prescription drugs beginning in january 2008 we expect the use of an amp benchmark to result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our healthcare provider customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

congress may take action before the end of the year to increase the medicaid drug rebate amount for branded pharmaceuticals amend the medicare asp calculation methodology or otherwise modify medicaremedicaid drug payment policy 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further impact medicare or medicaid spending 

see “risk factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

  

health information practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder by hhs set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of these standards we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations

 item 1a risk factors 

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risks factors are in addition to those set for the elsewhere in this report 

intense competition may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with large wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals such as cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers who distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and other healthcare providers the pmsi business also operates in a highly competitive environment 

competitive pressures have contributed to a decline in our gross profit margins on operating revenue from 542 in fiscal 2001 to 377 in fiscal 2007 this trend may continue and our business could be adversely affected as a result 

our operating revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

our largest customer accounted for 14 of our total revenue and 8 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2007 our top ten customers represented approximately 34 of fiscal 2007 operating revenue we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 8 of our operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 was derived from our two largest gpo relationships novation and premier we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our operating revenue and results of operations 

our operating revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally 

  

are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2007 the largest trade receivable due from a single customer represented approximately 11 of accounts receivable net 

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are owed to us from the suppliers including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods and amounts owed to us for services provided to the suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example the florida prescription drug pedigree laws and regulations that became effective in july 2006 imposed obligations upon us to deliver prescription drug pedigrees to various categories of customers in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays other states are considering laws and regulations that would require us to implement pedigree capabilities in those other states similar to the pedigree capabilities implemented for florida effective january 1 2009 california will require the implementation of costly track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification rfid technologies at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the pharmaceutical drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of certain provisions of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors on february 1 2007 hhs and the fda appealed this decision to the federal court of appeals for the second circuit we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

in addition the fda amendments act of 2007 which went into effect on october 1 2007 requires the fda to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs these standards may include any trackandtrace or authentication technologies such as rfid and other technologies the fda must develop a standardized numerical identifier by april 1 2010 

the suspension or revocation by the dea of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our distribution facilities to purchase store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by dea to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration in order to service our customers may adversely affect our reputation our business and our results of operations 

on april 24 2007 the dea imposed an order to show cause and immediate suspension on our orlando florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals the dea alleged that we did not maintain effective controls at our orlando florida distribution center against diversion of controlled substances to certain internet pharmacies on june 22 2007 we entered into a settlement with the 

  

dea in which we expressly denied the dea’s allegations and which led to the reinstatement of our orlando florida distribution center’s suspended license to distribute controlled substances and listed chemicals to its retail customers on august 25 2007 as required by the settlement agreement we implemented an enhanced and more sophisticated ordermonitoring program in all of our amerisourcebergen drug corporation distribution centers by june 30 2007 we have passed all the dea compliance reviews relating to the new program and as a result our orlando florida distribution center’s license was reinstated effective august 25 2007 while we expect to continue to comply with all of the dea’s requirements there can be no assurance that the dea will not require further controls against the diversion of controlled substances in the future or will not take similar action against any other of our distribution centers in the future 

on october 1 2007 we acquired bellco health a privately held new york distributor of branded and generic pharmaceuticals bellco health consists of two companies bellco drug corp and american medical distributors inc “amd” the dea registration of bellco drug was suspended in may 2007 prior to our acquisition of the business amd’s registration was not suspended but both amd and bellco drug received an order to show cause why their registrations should not be revoked  the suspension of bellco drug’s registration and the order to show cause were based on bellco drug’s alleged failures to maintain effective controls against the diversion of controlled substances as required by federal law in june 2007 bellco drug entered into a consent judgment with the dea in which bellco drug expressly denied the allegations of diversion and agreed to voluntarily surrender its dea registration with leave to apply for a new registration the administrative proceeding on the order to show cause relating to amd’s dea registration was also dismissed at that time pursuant to a separate memorandum of understanding between amd and dea which allowed amd to continue serving its customers and to expand its dea registration so that amd could service bellco drug’s metro new york city customers bellco drug has applied for a new dea registration as a result of our acquisition of bellco health and our own settlement agreement with the dea we expect that the bellco drug application for a new dea registration may be subject to particular review and scrutiny by the dea denial by the dea of bellco drug’s application for a new registration could adversely affect bellco health’s operations and ability to conduct business in the ordinary course and therefore could adversely affect both the value of the businesses that we just acquired and our overall results of operations 

legal and regulatory changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts from which we derive profit based upon reimbursement rates and methodology many of these contracts cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such legal and regulatory changes accordingly such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts until the end of the applicable contract periods 

absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by changes in medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower growth or lower revenues for absg 

the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” was intended to reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately 11 billion over five years effective january 1 2007 the dra changed the federal upper payment limit for medicaid reimbursement from 150 of the lowest published price for generic pharmaceuticals which is usually the average wholesale price to 250 of the lowest manufacturer price or amp on july 17 2007 cms published a final rule implementing these provisions and clarifying among other things the amp calculation methodology and the dra provision requiring manufacturers to publicly report amp for branded and generic pharmaceuticals cms has stated that it expects the federal upper payment limits will become effective for covered outpatient multiple source prescription drugs beginning in january 2008 we expect the use of an amp benchmark to result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain 

  

generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on our business we are continuing to work with our customers in this process we are currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative and regulatory changes if we fail to successfully develop and implement such plans this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect our results of operations 

congress may take action before the end of the year to increase the medicaid drug rebate amount for branded pharmaceuticals amend the medicare asp calculation methodology or otherwise modify medicaremedicaid drug payment policy 

our operating revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia drugs primarily those used in oncology and may in the future be adversely affected by any further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in medicare reimbursement for these drugs several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs including the decision in march 2007 by the us food and drug administration “fda” to require an expanded warning label on these drugs cms’s review of reimbursement policies for these drugs and restrictions on recommended dosage or use in july 2007 cms issued new more restrictive policies regarding medicare coverage of anemia drugs used in the treatment of oncology patients and for kidney failure and dialysis the fda held a meeting in september 2007 to discuss updated information about the safety of these anemia drugs for patients with chronic renal failure on november 8 2007 the fda announced revised boxed warnings and other safetyrelated product labeling changes for these drugs addressing the risks posed to patients with cancer or chronic kidney failure cms also has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues 

first databank inc “first databank” publishes drug databases that contain drug information and pricing data the pricing data includes average wholesale price or awp which is a pricing benchmark widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers awp is also used to establish the pricing of pharmaceuticals to certain of our pharmaceutical distribution customers in puerto rico in october 2006 first databank agreed to a proposed settlement in legal proceeding that would require first databank to stop publishing awp two years after the settlement becomes effective unless a competitor of first databank is publishing awp at that future time the settlement would also require first databank to change the way it calculates awp during the twoyear interim period the proposed settlement is subject to several contingencies and has not yet received final approval by the court we continue to evaluate the potential impact that it could have on the business of our customers and our business there can be no assurance that the settlement if approved would not have an adverse impact on the business of our customers andor our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities at this time we can provide no assurances that such changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

the changing united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in 

  

legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

in fiscal 2006 we acquired three pharmaceutical distributors based in canada and a provider of contract packaging and clinical trials materials services based in the united kingdom and may consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

  

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2008 as required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide an unqualified attestation or any attestation regarding the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our management will be required to deliver a report in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2008 similar to the one delivered herein that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we also will be required to deliver an attestation report similar to the one delivered herein of our independent registered public accounting firm on the operating effectiveness of our internal controls we have undertaken substantial effort to assess enhance and document our internal control systems financial processes and information systems and expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2008 in preparation for the required annual evaluation process significant use of resources both internal and external will be required to make the requisite evaluation of the annual effectiveness of our internal controls while we believe we have adequate internal controls and will meet our obligations there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the work necessary for our management to issue the report in a timely manner or that management or our independent registered public accounting firm will conclude that our internal controls are effective 

in addition abdc’s controls are dependent in part on the third party service provider ibm to which we have outsourced responsibility for a significant portion of our information technology activities if ibm does not perform satisfactorily andor provide the assurances to us and our independent registered public accounting firm that are required the ability of the company and the accounting firm to conclude that our internal controls are effective could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical distribution segment is subject to inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices which subjects us to risks and uncertainties 

as part of our transition to feeforservice some distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased as a result approximately 20 of our gross profit from brand name manufacturers continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of price appreciation if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition the pharmaceutical distribution segment distributes generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties a third party service provider ibm is responsible for managing a significant portion of abdc’s information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses are considering substantial investments in information systems during fiscal 2008 to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

  

risks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning erp system may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

we have announced intentions to implement an erp system to handle the business operating and financial processes within abdc and within our company at a corporate level erp implementations are complex and timeconsuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years erp implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the erp system our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the we experience operating problems andor cost overruns during the erp implementation process or if the erp system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and the united kingdom as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge

in april 2005 the company received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the “nyag” requesting documents and responses to interrogatories concerning the manner and degree to which the company purchased pharmaceuticals from other wholesalers often referred to as the alternate source market rather than directly from manufacturers similar subpoenas have been issued by the nyag to other pharmaceutical distributors the company has engaged in discussions with the nyag initially to clarify the scope of the subpoena and subsequently to provide background information requested by the nyag the company has produced responsive information and documents and will continue to cooperate with the nyag recently the company has received a communication from the nyag detailing potential theories of liability and the company has met with the nyag to discuss how to resolve the matter the company believes that it has not engaged in any wrongdoing but cannot predict the outcome of this matter 

bergen brunswig matter 

a former bergen brunswig chief executive officer who was terminated in 1999 filed an action in the superior court of california county of orange the “court” claiming that bergen brunswig predecessor in interest to amerisourcebergen corporation had breached its obligations to him under his employment agreement shortly after the filing of the lawsuit bergen brunswig made a california civil procedure code §998 offer of judgment to the executive which the executive accepted the resulting judgment awarded the executive damages and the continuation of certain employment benefits since then the company and the executive have engaged in litigation as to what specific benefits were included in the scope of the offer of judgment and the value of those benefits the court entered an order in implementation of judgment on june 7 2001 which identified the specific benefits encompassed by the offer of judgment following submission by the executive of

summary segment information 

 

  

    

year ended september 30 2007 compared with year ended september 30 2006 

consolidated results 

operating revenue of 617 billion in fiscal 2007 which excludes bulk deliveries increased 9 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increases in operating revenue in our abdc and absg operating segments both of which are included in the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment our acquisitions contributed 1 of the operating revenue growth in fiscal 2007 

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites ie drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites ie crossdock shipment bulk deliveries of 44 billion in fiscal 2007 decreased 3 from the prior fiscal year revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products whether the products are dropshipped or shipped crossdock the company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer as a result and in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

gross profit of 23 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 4 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to the increase in pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue an increase in compensation under its feeforservice agreements and the growth of its generic programs offset in part by a 278 million charge incurred by absg relating to tetanusdiphtheria vaccine inventory and the decline in gross profit of the other segment during fiscal 2007 and 2006 the company recognized gains of 358 million and 409 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these gains which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2 of gross profit in fiscal 2007 and 2006 the company is unable to estimate future gains if any it will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in fiscal 2007 decreased 17 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the decline in gross profit of the other segment 

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 15 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 3 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth operating expenses of our recently acquired companies an increase in bad debt expense of 147 million and an increase in sharebased compensation of 86 million all of which was partially offset by a decline in dsada of the other segment and a decline in employee incentive compensation as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in fiscal 2007 decreased 14 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decline in dsada of the other segment resulting from the divestiture of the longterm care business 

in 2001 the company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions the plan which is complete included building six new facilities closing 31 facilities and outsourcing a significant portion of its information technology activities to complete the plan we closed two distribution facilities in fiscal 2007 and now have 26 distribution facilities in the us as of september 30 2007 the company closed six distribution facilities in each of fiscal 2006 and 2005 during fiscal 2006 the company opened the last of its new distribution facilities and completed the outsourcing of a significant portion of its information technology activities 

  

the following table illustrates the charges incurred by the company relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 and 2006 in thousands 

 

 in fiscal 2006 the company incurred a charge of 139 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employmentrelated dispute with a former bergen brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 in october 2007 the company received a favorable ruling from a california appellate court reversing certain portions of the prior adverse decision as a result the company reduced its liability in fiscal 2007 to the bergen brunswig chief executive officer by 104 million see bergen brunswig matter under note 13 of the consolidated financial statements the fiscal 2006 compensation expense and the fiscal 2007 reduction thereof have been recorded as a component of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table 

in fiscal 2007 the company sold certain retail pharmacy assets of its longterm care business prior to the longterm care divestiture and as a result recognized a gain of 31 million 

in fiscal 2006 the company realized a 173 million gain from the sale of the former bergen brunswig headquarters building in orange california this gain was recorded as a component of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table 

all employee terminations have been completed relating to the aforementioned integration plan the company paid a total of 207 million and 206 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs during fiscal years 2007 and 2006 respectively related to the integration plan remaining unpaid amounts of 159 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2007 most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not in excess of 12 months while others may receive a lumpsum payment 

operating income of 8203 million in fiscal 2007 increased 10 from the prior fiscal year due to the pharmaceutical distribution segment offset in part by the other segment as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in fiscal 2007 increased 1 basis point from the prior fiscal year due to the 5 basis point improvement in pharmaceutical distribution’s operating income margin that was largely offset by the decline in the other segment’s operating income margin the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 338 million to operating income in fiscal 2007 and contributed 5 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 208 million to operating income in fiscal 2006 and contributed 4 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue 

other loss of 30 million in fiscal 2007 primarily related to otherthantemporary impairment losses incurred with respect to equity investments other income of 44 million in fiscal 2006 primarily included a 34 million gain resulting from an eminent domain settlement and a 31 million gain on the sale of an equity investment offset in part by losses incurred relating to an equity investment 

  

interest expense and interest income and their respective weightedaverage interest rates in fiscal 2007 and 2006 were as follows in thousands 

 

 interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase of 1143 million in average borrowings primarily related to the company’s canadian operations interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decline in average invested cash and shortterm investments of 3136 million from the prior fiscal year the decrease in invested cash and shortterm investments from the prior fiscal year was primarily related to the company’s 14 billion of purchases of its common stock in fiscal 2007 offset largely by 12 billion of net cash provided by operating activities the company’s net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in interest rates and strategic decisions made by the company to deploy its invested cash and shortterm investments 

income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of 371 versus 368 in the prior fiscal year the tax rate for fiscal 2007 was greater than the tax rate for the prior fiscal year which benefitted from more favorable tax adjustments than the current fiscal year and a larger portion of the company’s invested cash in taxfree investments the company expects to have an effective income tax rate between 37 and 38 in future periods which will primarily depend on its mix of taxfree and taxable investments including cash and cash equivalents 

income from continuing operations of 4938 million in fiscal 2007 increased 6 from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in operating income partially offset by the increase in interest expense diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 263 in fiscal 2007 increased 16 from 226 per share in the prior fiscal year the divested longterm care business contributed 008 and 010 of diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2007 and 2006 respectively the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 170 million to income from continuing operations and 009 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the eminent domain settlement the sale of an equity investment and the favorable tax adjustments less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 232 million to income from continuing operations and 011 to diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 

loss from discontinued operations of 246 million net of tax in fiscal 2007 relates to an adverse court ruling received by the company with respect to a contingent purchase price adjustment in connection with the 2003 acquisition of bridge medical inc “bridge” as previously discussed in legal proceedings under item 3 substantially all of the assets of the bridge business were sold in july 2005 

net income of 4692 million in fiscal 2007 was flat compared to the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share of 250 in fiscal 2007 increased 11 from 225 per share in the prior fiscal year the increase in diluted earnings per share was due to the 9 reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the company’s purchases of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs see liquidity and capital resources net of the impact of stock option exercises 

  

segment information 

pharmaceutical distribution 

pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of 609 billion in fiscal 2007 increased 9 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by the strong above market 23 operating revenue growth of absg principally in its distribution businesses abdc grew its operating revenue by 6 in comparison to the prior fiscal year during fiscal 2007 62 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 38 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 58 institutional and 42 retail in comparison with the prioryear results sales to institutional customers increased 14 primarily due to the strong growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business sales to retail customers increased 2 as growth in retail chain sales was offset in part by our decision to discontinue servicing the large lower margin customer discussed below 

the abdc operating revenue growth rate in fiscal 2007 benefited from increased sales to certain of its large customers and the 1 revenue contribution resulting from the fullyear impact of its 2006 canadian acquisitions abdc’s operating revenue growth rate was negatively impacted by the company’s decision not to renew a contract effective january 2007 with a large lowmargin customer that contributed approximately 10 billion of operating revenue for abdc in fiscal 2006 and the july 2006 loss of two customer accounts that totaled 12 billion of revenue in fiscal 2006 these customer accounts transitioned to another distributor after they were acquired by a company supplied by that distributor 

absg grew at a rate in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth absg’s operating revenue of 122 billion in fiscal 2007 grew 23 from the prior fiscal year the majority of this group’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states especially oncology absg’s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be absg’s most significant contributor to revenue growth during fiscal 2007 the oncology business benefited from a semiexclusive distribution agreement that it signed with a large biotechnology manufacturer during the second half of fiscal 2006 and absg’s besse medical business experienced strong growth in fiscal 2007 primarily arising from the distribution of a new physicianadministered ophthalmology product which was introduced in the second half of fiscal 2006 absg also distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians and anemia drugs since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians any changes to this service channel could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues 

approximately 6 of the company’s operating revenue in fiscal 2007 related to the distribution of anemiarelated products which are distributed by both abdc and absg several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia drugs during the second half of fiscal 2007 including the decision in march 2007 by the us food and drug administration “fda” to require an expanded warning label on these drugs cms’s review of reimbursement policies for these drugs and restrictions on recommended dosage or use in july 2007 cms issued new more restrictive policies regarding medicare coverage of anemia drugs used in the treatment of oncology patients and for kidney failure and dialysis on november 8 2007 the fda announced revised boxed warnings and other safetyrelated product labeling changes for these drugs addressing the risks posed to patients with cancer or chronic kidney failure cms also has indicated that it may impose additional restrictions on medicare coverage in the future further changes in medical guidelines for anemia drugs may impact the availability and extent of reimbursement for these drugs from third party payers including federal and state governments and private insurance plans the company’s future operating revenue growth rate andor profitability may continue to be impacted by any future reductions in reimbursement for anemia drugs or changes that limit the dosage and or use of anemia drugs see part i item 1a risk factors on page 13 

the company currently expects that its operating revenue growth in fiscal 2008 will range from 5 to 7 including a 3 contribution from its acquisition of bellco abdc revenues are expected to grow with the overall pharmaceutical market growth rate and absg revenues are expected to be flat to down 5 from fiscal 2007 

  

primarily as a result of declining anemia drug sales and due to one of its customers for oncology drugs being acquired by a competitor in october 2007 the former customer contributed approximately 800 million to absg’s operating revenue in fiscal 2007 abdc’s and absg’s future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors these factors include competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates changes in federal government rules and regulations and industry growth trends such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers 

this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization the introduction of new products and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry sales in the united states as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc “ims” are expected to grow between 4 and 5 in 2008 and between 6 and 9 per year over the next five years ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals would grow faster than the overall market 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 18761 million in fiscal 2007 increased 9 from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements and the growth of our generic programs offset in part by competitive pricing pressures and absg’s 278 million charge relating to the writedown of tetanusdiphtheria vaccine inventory to its estimated net realizable value see mbl matter under note 13 of the consolidated financial statements as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in fiscal 2007 was flat compared to fiscal 2006 the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences during fiscal 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million 

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 11427 million in fiscal 2007 increased 6 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily related to our operating revenue growth operating expenses of our recently acquired companies an increase in bad debt expense of 86 million primarily related to the recent bankruptcy of a retail chain customer in our west region and an increase in sharebased compensation and was partially offset by a decrease in employee incentive compensation as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses in fiscal 2007 decreased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to economies of scale realized as a result of the increase in operating revenue productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network as a result of our optimiz ® program and a decrease in employee incentive compensation and was partially offset by the increase in bad debt expense and the operating costs of our recently acquired companies 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 7334 million in fiscal 2007 increased 14 from the prior fiscal year as the increase in gross profit exceeded the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in fiscal 2007 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the improvement in the operating expense margin 

other 

as previously noted the operating results of the other segment in fiscal 2007 includes the operating results of longterm care only for the ten months ended july 31 2007 due to the divestiture and the operating results of pmsi for the full fiscal year ended september 30 2007 therefore the fiscal 2007 results of operations of the other segment is not comparable to fiscal 2006 results 

  

longterm care 

longterm care’s operating revenue decreased 14 from the prior fiscal year due to the divestiture effective july 31 2007 as discussed above longterm care’s gross profit operating expenses and operating income as a percentage of revenue in fiscal 2007 were relatively consistent with the prior fiscal year 

pmsi 

pmsi operating revenue of 4614 million in fiscal 2007 increased 1 from the prior fiscal year this increase was the net result of the additional revenues of 190 million or 4 from the acquisition of pmsi msa services which was partially offset by a 3 decline in pmsi’s business due to competitive pressures in particular the loss of one customer in fiscal 2007 substantially contributed to the decline of pmsi’s business pmsi’s operating revenue in fiscal 2008 is expected to be flat to down due to the loss of certain customers and will likely continue to be impacted significantly by competitive pressures operating revenue is also likely to be impacted in the future by the regulatory environment and the pharmaceutical inflation rate 

pmsi gross profit of 1077 million in fiscal 2007 decreased 2 from the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit was 2334 in fiscal 2007 compared to 2413 in the prior fiscal year these declines were primarily due to the aforementioned customer loss and continuing industry competitive pressures surrounding pricing which were partially offset by the additional 124 million gross profit contribution made by pmsi msa services future gross profit will likely be impacted by industry competitive pressures and continued downward pressure on rates of reimbursement for services provided 

pmsi operating expenses of 795 million in fiscal 2007 increased 35 or 207 million from the prior fiscal year due to the additional 77 million of operating expenses of the pmsi msa services business additional costs incurred relating to customer initiatives investments in information technology infrastructure and an increase in bad debt expense bad debt expense in fiscal 2007 increased by 37 million with the prior fiscal year having benefitted from significant bad debt recoveries made as a result of improvements made in credit and cash application management procedures additionally pmsi operating expenses in the prior fiscal year benefitted from a 32 million reduction in sales tax liabilities 

pmsi operating income of 282 million in fiscal 2007 decreased 45 from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in its operating expenses and to a lesser extent a decline in its gross profit we expect the operating income of pmsi in fiscal 2008 to be flat to down when compared to fiscal 2007 due to customer losses and continuing costs relating to customer initiatives and investments in its information technology infrastructure

year ended september 30 2006 compared with year ended september 30 2005 

consolidated results 

operating revenue of 567 billion in fiscal 2006 which excludes bulk deliveries increased 13 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk deliveries of 45 billion in fiscal 2006 decreased 1 from the prior fiscal year revenue relating to bulk deliveries fluctuates primarily due to changes in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer due to the insignificant service fees generated 

  

from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

gross profit of 22 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 13 from the prior fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the increase in pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements and growth of our generic programs as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in fiscal 2006 decreased by 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong growth in business with a few of our larger lowermargin customers during fiscal 2006 and 2005 the company recognized gains of 409 million and 401 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers which represented 2 of gross profit 

dsada of 15 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 11 from the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily related to growth in operating revenue operating expenses of our acquired companies investments to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within abdc and sharebased compensation expense related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “share based payment” as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in fiscal 2006 decreased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year this decline was primarily due to productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network as a result of the optimiz ® program offset in part by investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within abdc expenses of our acquired companies and sharebased compensation expense 

in 2001 the company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions the plan included building six new facilities closing 31 facilities and outsourcing a significant portion of its information technology activities during fiscal 2006 the company opened the last of its new distribution facilities and completed the outsourcing of a significant portion of its information technology activities 

during fiscal 2005 the company announced plans to continue to consolidate and eliminate certain administrative functions and to outsource a significant portion of the company’s information technology activities the “fiscal 2005 initiatives” during fiscal 2006 the company closed six distribution facilities the “fiscal 2006 initiatives” incurred expenses relating to the planned spinoff of pharmerica longterm care realized a 173 million gain from the sale of the former bergen brunswig headquarters building in orange california and incurred a charge of 139 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employmentrelated dispute with a former bergen brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 see bergen brunswig matter under note 13 of the consolidated financial statements 

the following table illustrates the charges incurred by the company relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 in thousands 

 

 the gain realized on the sale of the bergen brunswig headquarters and the compensation expense recognized in connection with the former bergen brunswig chief executive officer are components of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table 

  

through september 30 2006 approximately 440 employees had been given termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2006 initiatives of which approximately 400 had been terminated as a result of the fiscal 2005 initiatives approximately 450 employees were terminated 

the company paid a total of 206 million and 135 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs during fiscal 2006 and 2005 respectively related to the aforementioned integration plan most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not in excess of 12 months while others may receive a lumpsum payment 

in fiscal 2005 the company recorded an impairment charge of 53 million relating to certain intangible assets held by abdc 

operating income of 7487 million in fiscal 2006 increased 18 from the prior fiscal year the company’s operating income as a percentage of operating revenue in fiscal 2006 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gross profit in the pharmaceutical distribution segment the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 208 million to operating income in fiscal 2006 and contributed 4 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue  the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other and the impairment charge contributed 121 million to operating income in fiscal 2005 and contributed 2 basis points to operating income as a percentage of operating revenue 

other income of 44 million in fiscal 2006 primarily included a 34 million gain resulting from an eminent domain settlement and a 31 million gain on the sale of an equity investment offset in part by losses incurred relating to another equity investment 

interest expense and interest income and their respective weightedaverage interest rates in fiscal 2006 and 2005 were as follows in thousands 

 

 interest expense declined from the prior fiscal year due to a decline in weightedaverage interest rates resulting from the company’s fiscal 2005 longterm debt refinancing interest income increased from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in the company’s average cash and shortterm investments and an increase in market interest rates the company’s average invested cash and shortterm investments during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was 13 billion and 09 billion respectively 

the company recorded a 1119 million loss in fiscal 2005 related to the early retirement of debt 

income tax expense reflects an effective income tax rate of 368 versus 377 in the prior fiscal year the decline in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of our taxfree investments in comparison to our taxable investments including cash and cash equivalents and certain other favorable tax adjustments 

income from continuing operations of 4680 million in fiscal 2006 increased 60 from the prior fiscal year before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 226 in fiscal 2006 increased 65 from 137 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year before the cumulative 

  

effect of the change in accounting the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the eminent domain settlement the sale of an equity investment and the favorable tax adjustments less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other contributed 232 million to income from continuing operations and 011 to diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in fiscal 2006 the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other the impairment charge and the loss on early retirement of debt decreased income from continuing operations by 642 million and decreased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 030 in fiscal 2005 

in connection with the transition to a feeforservice model the company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives effective october 1 2004 the company recorded a 102 million charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting net of tax of 63 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 this 102 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by 005 in fiscal 2005 

loss from discontinued operations of 03 million net of tax in fiscal 2006 relates to certain adjustments made by the company in connection with the december 2004 sale of the company’s rita ann cosmetics distribution business as well as the july 2005 sale of substantially all of the assets of bridge medical inc “bridge” loss from discontinued operations net of tax during fiscal year ended september 30 2005 includes operating losses incurred in connection with the rita ann and bridge businesses the company incurred a 65 million loss net of tax on the sale of the rita ann business and a 46 million loss net of tax on the sale of the bridge business both of which are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal 2005 

net income of 4677 million in fiscal 2006 increased 77 from the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share of 225 in fiscal 2006 increased 81 from 124 per share in the prior fiscal year the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the reduced number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the company’s purchase of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs see liquidity and capital resources offset in part by the increase in the number of stock option exercises 

segment information 

pharmaceutical distribution 

pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of 559 million in fiscal 2006 increased 13 from the prior fiscal year the company’s acquisitions primarily amerisourcebergen canada corporation “abcc” contributed 15 of the operating revenue growth in fiscal 2006 our operating revenue growth was higher than the market growth rate and was driven by growth from a few of our larger institutional customers within abdc the continued strong growth of absg principally in its distribution businesses and new customers in all customer classes during fiscal 2006 58 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 42 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57 institutional and 43 retail in comparison with the prioryear results sales to institutional customers increased 16 primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and the growth of sales to a few of our larger alternatesite institutional customers within abdc sales to retail customers increased 10 over the prior fiscal year the company’s acquisitions contributed 4 of the retail customer growth 

this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix as previously mentioned our revenue growth in fiscal 2006 exceeded market growth primarily due to the growth of a few of our larger institutional customers within abdc as well as the strong growth of absg in july 2006 the company discontinued servicing two customer accounts which contributed 12 billion and 14 billion of the segment’s operating revenue in the fiscal years 2006 and 2005 respectively 

  

the company’s specialty group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth the specialty group’s operating revenue grew 33 to 99 billion in fiscal 2006 from 74 billion in the prior fiscal year the majority of this group’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states such as oncology additionally the specialty group distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products the specialty group’s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the specialty group’s most significant contributor to revenue growth the specialty group’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since the specialty group provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the specialty group 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 17 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 15 from the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements and the growth of our generic programs as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in fiscal 2006 increased 5 basis points from the prior fiscal year the improvement was primarily due to an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements the growth of our generic programs and contributions from our acquisitions customer mix including the higher than average growth rate of a few of our larger lower margin customers partially offset the aforementioned improvements the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences during fiscal 2005 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 306 million 

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 11 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 12 from the prior fiscal year the increase in operating expenses was primarily related to growth in operating revenue and the operating expenses of our acquired companies as well as sharebased compensation expense related to the fiscal 2006 adoption of sfas no 123r as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses in fiscal 2006 decreased 2 basis points from the prior fiscal year as productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network as a result of our optimiz ® program were partially offset by our acquisitions our investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures and sharebased compensation expense 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 6442 million in fiscal 2006 increased 21 from the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in fiscal 2006 increased 7 basis points from the prior fiscal year the increase over the prioryear percentage was due to an increase in gross profit and reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue as compared to the prior fiscal year as discussed above 

other 

other segment operating revenue of 17 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 6 from the prior fiscal year the increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by the longterm care business longterm care operating revenue of 12 billion in fiscal 2006 increased 7 from the prior fiscal year as a result of an increase in the number of beds served higher patient acuity and drug price inflation pmsi operating revenue of 4568 million in fiscal 2006 increased 4 from the prior fiscal year 

other segment gross profit of 4673 million in fiscal 2006 increased 5 from the prior fiscal year and was driven by an increase in longterm care’s gross profit offset by a decline in pmsi gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in fiscal 2006 decreased 39 basis points from the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures in both the longterm care and pmsi businesses and lower rates of reimbursement for services provided by the pmsi business longterm care gross 

  

profit of 3571 million in fiscal 2006 increased 8 from the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by the increase in operating revenue pmsi gross profit of 1102 million in fiscal 2006 decreased 4 from the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures and lower rates of reimbursement from third party payors 

other segment operating expenses of 3835 million in fiscal 2006 increased 8 from the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses in fiscal 2006 increased 45 basis points from the prior fiscal year longterm care operating expenses of 3247 million in fiscal 2006 increased 10 from the prior fiscal year this increase was largely due to operating revenue growth an increase in bad debt expense of 145 million and additional costs related to the implementation of medicare part d under the mma which became effective on january 1 2006 longterm care’s bad debt expense increased over the prior year primarily due to billing and collection issues relating to the mma transition and the negative impact that texas medicaid changes had on certain of its nursing home customers pmsi operating expenses of 588 million in fiscal 2006 increased 2 from the prior fiscal year this increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by an increase in operating revenue and was partially offset by a 43 million reduction in bad debt expense primarily due to improvements made in credit and cash application management and a 32 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable settlements

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts the company considers a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends its customers’ financial strength and credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables each of the company’s business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise the company writes off balances against the reserves when collectibility is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the 

  

allowance at least quarterly and the company’s largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs recoveries and other adjustments schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2007 2006 and 2005 was 510 million 363 million and 334 million respectively the increase in bad debt expense in fiscal 2007 was due to increases in both the pharmaceutical distribution and other reporting segments of 86 million and 61 million respectively the recent bankruptcy of a regional chain customer in abdc’s west region accounted for the majority of the bad debt increase within pharmaceutical distribution pmsi’s bad debt expense in fiscal 2007 increased by 37 million with the prior fiscal year having benefitted from significant bad debt recoveries as a result of improvements made in credit and cash application management procedures an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2007 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 39 million 

supplier reserves 

the company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the company these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the company the company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2007 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 70 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different from the company’s estimate 

loss contingencies 

the company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 “accounting for contingencies” an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 79 and 83 of the company’s inventories at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively have been determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if the company had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 1549 million and 1526 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2007 and 2006 respectively during the fiscal year ended september 30 2007 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2007 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 72 million and increase diluted earnings per share by 002 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 inventory declines resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 306 million and increase diluted earnings per share by 009 

  

business combinations 

in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill the company engages thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements patents and software technology are amortized over their useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under sfas no 142 a determination of the fair value of the company’s reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit andor the component of the entity being valued the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value this impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of the company’s market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management the company’s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the company’s future financial results the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 and did not record any significant impairment charges as a result of the tests 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 the company performed an impairment test on certain intangible assets within the technology operations of abdc due to the existence of impairment indicators as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 53 million relating to certain of those intangible assets the charge was reflected in the company’s results of operations in fiscal 2005 

sharebased compensation 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” using the modifiedprospective transition method and therefore began to expense the fair value of all options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options were not fully vested as of the adoption date and began to expense the fair value of all sharebased compensation awards granted subsequent to september 30 2005 over their requisite service periods the company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of 

  

the option future volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

the company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

in addition the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 5 “accounting for uncertainties” the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business the company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances a thorough research of the technical merits of the company’s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments in all cases the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 

the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 79 million in fiscal 2007

market risk 

the company’s most significant market risk is the effect of fluctuations in interest rates the company manages interest rate risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt the company also has market risk exposure relating to its cash and cash equivalents and its shortterm investment securities availableforsale at september 30 2007 the company had 3297 million of variablerate debt the amount of variable rate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company’s working capital requirements the company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the company there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2007 

the company had 6402 million in cash and cash equivalents and 4674 million of shortterm investment securities availableforsale at september 30 2007 the unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and shortterm investment securities availableforsale would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variablerate debt for every 100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variablerate debt a 50 basis point decrease in interest rates would increase the company’s annual net interest expense by 05 million

in june 2006 the fasb issued financial interpretation “fin” no 48 “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 109 “accounting for income taxes” this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return more specifically a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50 likely of being realized upon settlement the company will adopt the provisions of fin no 48 in its first quarter of fiscal 2008 the cumulative effects if any of applying this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2008 the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this interpretation 

in september 2006 the fasb issued sfas no 158 “employers’ accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans” which requires an employer to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plans in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income this statement also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its balance sheet sfas no 158 was effective for the company as of september 30 2007 with respect to recognition of the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in its 

  

balance sheet this statement also requires plan assets and benefit obligations to be measured as of the company’s balance sheet date effective for fiscal years ending after december 15 2008 the adoption of the recognition provisions of this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations

amerisourcebergen corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies with operations in the united states canada and the united kingdom servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel we provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers located in the united states and canada including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities physicians clinics and other alternate site facilities and skilled nursing and assisted living centers we also provide pharmaceuticals and pharmacy services to longterm care workers’ compensation and specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmacy automation supply management software pharmaceutical packaging inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and physician education all of which are designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes 

industry overview 

we have benefited from the significant growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states according to ims healthcare inc “ims” an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales in the united states are expected to grow between 4 and 5 in 2007 and between 5 and 8 over the next five years ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty products and the generics market will grow at higher levels 

the factors contributing to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

aging population  the number of individuals over age 55 in the united states grew from approximately 52 million in 1990 to approximately 59 million in 2000 and is projected to increase to more than 75 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from chronic illnesses and disabilities more than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene research and therapy continue to generate new compounds and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases these compounds have been responsible for significant increases in pharmaceutical sales we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs in particular will provide opportunities for continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business 

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies 

  

pharmaceutical supply channel changes historically we and our major pharmaceutical distribution competitors derived a significant portion of our pharmaceutical distribution gross margin from manufacturer price increases which have historically equaled or exceeded the overall consumer price index more recently pharmaceutical manufacturers have been under significant pressure to reduce the rate of pharmaceutical price increases while a portion of our gross margin continues to be derived from manufacturer price increases our pharmaceutical distribution business has completed its transition to a feeforservice model in fiscal 2006 where we are largely compensated for the services we provide manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases the feeforservice model is intended to improve the efficiency and transparency of the supply channel and is expected to establish a more predictable earnings pattern for us while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers as of september 30 2006 we had feeforservice agreements in place with nearly all of the large brand name manufacturers during fiscal 2006 more than 75 of our brand name manufacturer gross margin was not contingent on manufacturer price increases 

legislative developments the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “mma” significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals were impacted by implementation of the mma by the us department of health and human services “hhs” further medicare reimbursement reductions and policy changes are scheduled to be implemented in the future the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” will reduce medicaid reimbursement for certain prescription drugs and the us congress may consider further reductions to medicaid reimbursement these policies may adversely affect our specialty distribution and our longterm care institutional pharmacy businesses directly and our wholesale drug distribution and specialty distribution businesses indirectly 

expiration of patents for brand name pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widelyused brand name pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years we consider this a favorable trend because generic products have historically provided a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand name products 

the company 

we were formed by the merger of amerisource health corporation “amerisource” and bergen brunswig corporation “bergen” in august 2001 we currently serve our customers including healthcare providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and patients through a geographically diverse network of distribution and service centers and other operations in the united states puerto rico and canada and through packaging facilities in the united states and the united kingdom in our pharmaceutical distribution business we typically are the primary source of supply for pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers and certain patients we offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel 

strategy 

our business strategy is focused solely on the pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide valueadded distribution and service solutions to healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase channel efficiencies and improve patient outcomes implementing this disciplined focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business and we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy 

 

   

in an effort to supplement our organic growth we continue to utilize a disciplined approach to seek acquisitions that will assist us with our strategic growth plans in october 2005 we acquired trent drugs wholesale ltd “trent” a canadian wholesaler of pharmaceutical products in january 2006 we changed trent’s name to amerisourcebergen canada corporation “amerisourcebergen canada” amerisourcebergen canada provided us with a solid foundation to expand our pharmaceutical distribution capability into the canadian marketplace in march 2006 amerisourcebergen canada acquired substantially all of the assets of asenda pharmaceutical supplies ltd “asenda” a canadian pharmaceutical distributor that operated primarily in british columbia and alberta the asenda acquisition strengthened our position in western canada in september 2006 amerisourcebergen canada acquired reppharm inc “reppharm” a canadian pharmaceutical distributor that primarily serves retail community pharmacies in the provinces of ontario quebec and alberta the reppharm acquisition continues our strategic focus on the pharmaceutical supply channel and places amerisourcebergen canada as the second largest pharmaceutical distributor in the canadian market 

we believe we have one of the lowest cost operating structures in pharmaceutical distribution among our major competitors and to further improve our position we launched our optimiz ® program in fiscal 2001 for amerisourcebergen drug corporation the optimiz ® program currently contemplates reducing the distribution facility network in the us from 51 facilities in 2001 to a distribution facility network numbering in the mid20s by the end of fiscal 2007 the plan includes building six new facilities all of which are currently operational and closing facilities 29 of which have been closed through september 30 2006 during fiscal 2006 we opened our last new facility and closed six facilities these measures have been designed to reduce operating costs and to reduce our working capital in addition we believe we will continue to achieve productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse automation technology adopt “best practices” in warehousing activities and increase operating leverage by increasing volume per fullservice distribution facility 

we have successfully transitioned our pharmaceutical distribution business to a feeforservice model this transition has allowed us to improve our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers this business model transition had a positive effect on our working capital and a substantial majority of our gross profit was not dependent upon manufacturer price increases during fiscal 2006 the feeforservice model is intended to improve the efficiency and transparency of the supply channel and is expected to establish a more predictable earnings pattern while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers we expect to derive additional efficiencies from our feeforservice model and continue to improve our relationships with our manufacturer suppliers 

 

 we expect to continue to expand our manufacturer services which help pharmaceutical manufacturers especially in the biotechnology sector commercialize their products in the channel we believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies to launch drugs with targeted populations and support the products in the channel we provide physician education services third party logistics and specialty pharmacy services to help speed products to market we expect to seek opportunities to enhance and expand the specialty pharmaceutical business in february 2006 we acquired network for medical communication  research llc “nmcr” a privatelyheld provider of accredited continuing medical education “cme” for physicians and analytical 

  

research for the oncology market the acquisition of nmcr expands amerisourcebergen specialty group’s “absg’s” presence in its marketleading oncology distribution and services businesses and complements imedex absg’s accredited cme business 

in october 2006 we acquired igg of america inc “igg” a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in the blood derivative ivig the addition of igg supports our strategy of building our specialty pharmaceutical services to manufacturers 

in november 2006 we acquired access md inc “amd” a canadian company that provides services including reimbursement support programs thirdparty logistics and nursing support services to manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals such as injectable and biological therapies the acquisition of amd expands our specialty services businesses into canada and complements the distribution services offered by amerisourcebergen canada 

 

 our provider solutions include our good neighbor pharmacy ® program which enables independent community pharmacies to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs bestpriced generic product purchasing services hospital pharmacy consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and packaging services that deliver unit dose punch card and other compliance packaging for institutional and retail pharmacy customers we also continue to pursue enhancements to our services and programs 

in march 2006 we acquired brecon pharmaceuticals limited “brecon” a united kingdombased provider of contract packaging and clinical trial materials “ctm” services for pharmaceutical manufacturers the acquisition of brecon enhances our packaging business and provides the added capability to offer pharmaceutical manufacturers contract packaging and ctm services in new geographical regions 

in october 2006 we acquired health advocates inc “health advocates” a leading provider of medicare setaside cost containment services to insurance payors primarily within the workers’ compensation industry health advocates was renamed pmsi msa services inc “pmsi msa services” and will operate under our workers’ compensation services business “pmsi” the addition of pmsi msa services combined with our leading pharmacy and clinical solutions gives our workers’ compensation business the ability to provide our customers with a fully integrated medicare setaside solution 

 

 in october 2006 we signed a master transaction agreement with kindred healthcare inc “kindred” to combine our respective institutional pharmacy businesses pharmerica longterm care and kindred pharmacy services “kps” into a new independent publicly traded company the proposed transaction is intended to be taxfree to the stockholders of both the company and kindred the new company would be the second largest in the institutional pharmacy services market with annual revenues of approximately 19 billion and a customer base of approximately 330000 licensed beds in 41 states the proposed combination does not include pmsi 

the transaction would begin with longterm care and kps each borrowing up to 150 million and providing a onetime distribution back to their respective parents the cash distribution is intended to 

  

be all or substantially all taxfree to us after the borrowing and distribution each of the institutional pharmacy businesses would be separately spun off as independent companies each with 100 percent stock ownership by the stockholders of their respective parents followed immediately by the independent companies combining in a stockforstock exchange which would result in our and kindred’s stockholders each owning 50 percent of the new company the master transaction agreement provides that at closing of the transaction we will enter into a pharmaceutical distribution agreement with the new company and kindred will enter into an agreement to provide information technology services to the new company the master transaction agreement also provides that at closing we kindred and the new company will enter into agreements for the provision of certain transition services for a limited transition period following consummation of the transaction consummation of the transaction is subject to a number of conditions including the effectiveness of a registration statement with respect to the shares of the new company’s common stock receipt of financing for the new company and for onetime cash distributions to us and kindred and receipt of a favorable determination from the internal revenue service regarding the taxfree nature of the transaction there can be no assurance that all conditions to completion of the transaction will be met 

operations 

operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” and the amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities clinics alternate site facilities and other customers in an effort to further protect the safety of the supply channel we purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers abdc also provides pharmacy management and consulting services and scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers substantially all of abdc’s operations are in the united states and canada 

absg through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states such as oncology absg also distributes vaccines other injectibles plasma and other blood products in addition through its manufacturer physician and patient services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization third party logistics group purchasing services and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers reimbursement consulting data analytics practice management and physician education substantially all of absg’s operations are in the united states 

abpg consists of american health packaging anderson packaging “anderson” and the recently acquired brecon american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers anderson is a leading provider of contract packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers brecon is a united kingdombased provider of contract packaging and ctm services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

the pharmerica segment includes the operations of the pharmerica longterm care business “longterm care” and a workers’ compensationrelated business “pmsi” 

longterm care is a leading national dispenser of pharmaceutical products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate site settings including skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and residential 

  

living communities longterm care’s institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment and the dispensing of those products to residents in longterm care and alternate site facilities unlike hospitals most longterm and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as longterm care to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication longterm care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patientspecific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition longterm care provides infusion therapy services as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services 

pmsi provides mail order and online pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers’ compensation programs and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors pmsi services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and computer software solutions to reduce payors’ administrative costs starting in fiscal 2007 pmsi also will offer medicare setaside cost containment services to its insurance payor customers 

sales and marketing abdc has a sales force organized regionally and specialized by healthcare provider type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings abdc’s marketing department designs and develops amerisourcebergen valueadded healthcare provider solutions and marketing materials tailored to specific groups these programs and materials can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions abdc’s sales and marketing also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and with the management of the specialty and packaging groups abdc sales and marketing ensures that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs our specialty and packaging groups and the longterm care and pmsi businesses each have independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product and service offerings 

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm and alternate care facilities and physician offices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our customers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers during fiscal 2006 operating revenue for our pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of 58 institutional and 42 retail 

our top ten customers represented approximately 32 of fiscal 2006 operating revenue our largest nonbulk customer represented 8 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2006 revenues generated from sales to medco health solutions inc “medco” accounted for approximately 98 of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and approximately 7 of operating revenue in fiscal 2006 other than our largest nonbulk customer and medco no individual customer accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2006 operating revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 8 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2006 was derived from our two largest gpo relationships novation and premier the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future operating revenue 

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 10 of our purchases in fiscal 2006 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good the ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2006 accounted for approximately 58 of our purchases 

  

historically a significant portion of abdc’s gross margin was derived from its ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases and to hold these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increased thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories this business practice led to significant volatility in abdc’s gross margin and therefore we transitioned our pharmaceutical distribution business to a feeforservice model where we are primarily compensated for the services we provide manufacturers versus one that was dependent upon manufacturer price increases under a typical feeforservice agreement we are compensated for our services based on a percentage of purchases over a defined time period with payment of fees being made directly or through a combination of direct payments and price increase entitlements as of september 30 2006 we have signed feeforservice agreements with substantially all of the large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers the feeforservice model is intended to improve the efficiency and transparency of the supply channel and is expected to establish a more predictable earnings pattern for abdc while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers the feeforservice arrangements may establish a more predictable earnings pattern because under many of the agreements we earn a fee for our services performed in contrast to a model where earnings are largely predicated upon the timing and amount of pharmaceutical price increases during fiscal 2006 more than 75 of abdc’s brand name manufacturer gross profit was not contingent on manufacturer price increases 

information systems abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the us on one centralized information system abdc’s information system provides for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s customized systems strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels 

abdc plans to continue to make system investments to further improve its information capabilities and meet its customer and operational needs abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc continues to implement a new warehouse operating system that is expected to improve its productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology as of september 30 2006 approximately twothirds of abdc’s transactional volume is generated from our distribution facilities that have successfully implemented the new warehouse operating system 

in an effort to maintain and improve its information technology infrastructure abdc decided to outsource a significant portion of the information technology activities relating to its corporate functions and to its operations and entered into a tenyear commitment effective july 1 2005 with ibm global services which has assumed responsibility for performing the outsourced information technology activities during fiscal 2006 and 2005 we incurred a total of approximately 21 million of transition costs which included employee severance and other contract expenses in connection with this plan 

absg operates its specialty distribution business on a common centralized erp platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the past few years we have introduced and enhanced our web capabilities such that a significant amount of orders are initiated via the internet 

pharmerica’s longterm care business operates a proprietary information technology infrastructure that automates order entry of medications dispensing of medications invoicing and payment processing these systems provide medical records consulting drug review and regulatory compliance information to help ensure patient safety in may 2006 longterm care acquired software in connection with its purchase of certain assets of a technology solution company that streamlines the exchange of information between longterm care and its customers and provides longterm care facilities with safe and efficient electronic medication management 

  

pharmerica’s pmsi business provides proprietary information technology for workers’ compensation solutions these systems provide eligibility authorization and reimbursement payments to participating pharmacies they also provide order taking shipment and collection of service fees for medications and specialty services the systems also provide billing and reimbursement for other services rendered pharmerica continues to invest in technologies that help improve data integrity critical information access and system availability 

competition 

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions our largest competitors are cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation abdc competes with both national and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution in addition we compete with regional and local distributors manufacturers who sell directly chain drugstores who do their own warehousing specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the distribution and related service businesses in which absg engages are also highly competitive absg’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors including oncology therapeutics network fff enterprises henry schein inc medpath priority healthcare corporation us oncology inc covance inc and ups logistics among others in all areas competitive factors include price product offerings valueadded service programs service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

pharmerica longterm care’s competitors principally include omnicare inc a national competitor which is significantly larger than pharmerica longterm care kindred pharmacy services as well as regional and local pharmacies that specialize in longterm care we believe that the competitive factors most important in pharmerica longterm care’s lines of business are quality and scope of service offered pricing ease of doing business with the provider and the ability to develop and maintain relationships with referral sources in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry in the local markets served by pharmerica longterm care and it may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants the pmsi business of pharmerica competes with numerous billing companies in connection with the portion of its business that electronically adjudicates workers’ compensation claims for payors pmsi also competes with various companies that provide home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment pmsi’s primary competitors include concentra operating corporation fiserv health medical services company cypress medical products and progressive medical inc 

intellectual property 

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states and in some cases in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and our medication and supply dispensing equipment we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

employees 

as of september 30 2006 we employed approximately 14700 persons of which approximately 13200 were fulltime employees approximately 3 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements we believe that our relationship with our employees is good 

  

government regulation 

we are subject to oversight by various state and federal governmental entities and we are subject to and affected by a variety of state and federal laws regulations and policies 

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances wholesale distributors of these substances are required to register for permits meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the dea fda and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these regulations we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements 

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws including the federal antikickback statute and the stark law the antikickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service or for inducing the purchasing leasing ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing leasing or ordering of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other federal healthcare programs the stark law prohibits physicians from making referrals for designated health services to certain entities with whom they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation the operations of longterm care and absg are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain aspects of our abdc operations 

the mma instituted an “average sales price” or “asp” methodology beginning in 2005 for medicare part b reimbursed drugs under medicare part b physicians have the option of continuing to obtain drugs under the traditional “buy and bill” approach and being reimbursed for the drugs at asp6 or acquiring drugs through a competitive acquisition program or cap physicians who participate in cap bill the medicare program only for drug administration while the cap vendor bills medicare for the actual cap drug and collects applicable beneficiary copayments we are not a cap vendor and an insignificant number of our physician customers have elected to participate in the cap to date 

the mma also significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through new medicare part d beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in outpatient prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beneficiaries who participate select from a range of standalone prescription drug plans or medicare advantage managed care plans that include prescription drug coverage along with other medicare services “part d plans” the part d plans are required to make available certain drugs on their formularies each part d plan negotiates reimbursement for part d drugs with pharmaceutical manufacturers 

the deficit reduction act of 2005 “dra” includes provisions that contemplate the use of average manufacturers’ price amp as the reimbursement benchmark under medicaid for generic pharmaceuticals starting in calendar year 2007 the dra requires cms to issue regulations on the amp calculation methodology no later than july 1 2007 we expect the use of an amp benchmark to result in a reduction in the medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain generic pharmaceuticals which may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for generic pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability 

under the prospective payment system “pps” for medicare patients in skilled nursing facilities medicare pays a federal daily rate for virtually all covered skilled nursing facility services under pps pharmerica’s longterm care skilled nursing facility customers are not able to pass through to medicare their costs for certain products and services provided by pharmerica instead medicare provides such customers a federal daily rate to 

  

cover the costs of all covered goods and services provided to medicare patients which may include certain pharmaceutical and other goods and services provided by pharmerica because this medicare reimbursement is limited by the pps facility customers have an increased incentive to negotiate with pharmerica to minimize the costs of providing goods and services to patients covered under medicare pharmerica bills skilled nursing facilities based on a negotiated fee schedule 

medicare beneficiaries who will have all or a substantial portion of their prescription drug costs covered by the medicare part d drug benefit include those nursing home residents served by the longterm care business who qualify for both medicare and medicaid and whose drug costs traditionally have been covered by medicaid programs in january 2005 the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” of hhs published final rules concerning the part d benefit while these rules established a framework for the new benefit cms continues to provide further information and guidance the rules permit longterm care pharmacies to provide covered medicare part d drugs to enrollees in the medicare part d plans under the part d rules longterm care pharmacies participate on an innetwork basis by contracting directly with the part d plans medicare part d could have an adverse effect on the longterm care business 

pharmerica’s longterm care business also receives reimbursement directly for dispensed pharmaceuticals in some cases under certain medicaid programs over the last several years certain medicaid programs have lowered reimbursement through a variety of mechanisms principally reductions in awp levels expansion of federal upper limit ful pricing and general reductions in contract payment methodology to pharmacies additional reimbursement reductions are possible in the future the us congress also is considering budget reconciliation legislation that would further reduce medicaid reimbursement for pharmaceuticals although to date the us congress has not adopted a final budget package moreover as noted above medicaid drug coverage was affected by the new medicare part d drug benefit that was implemented in 2006 since medicare part d not medicaid covers most outpatient drug expenses for beneficiaries who qualify for both medicare and medicaid coverage socalled “dual eligibles” including dual eligibles residing in nursing homes 

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel for example florida and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by information tracing drugs back to the manufacturers these and other requirements are expected to increase our cost of operations at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the pharmaceutical drug marketing act that became effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to the company of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict which reform proposals if any will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 

see “risk factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition 

health information practices 

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder by hhs set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of these standards we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations

 item 1a risk factors tableend the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

intense competition may erode our profit margins 

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with large wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals such as cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers who distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and other healthcare providers the longterm care and pmsi businesses in which pharmerica operates also are highly competitive 

competitive pressures have contributed to a decline in our gross profit margins on operating revenue from 542 in fiscal 2001 to 394 in fiscal 2006 this trend may continue and our business could be adversely affected as a result 

our operating revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

our top ten customers represented approximately 32 of operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 our largest individual customer accounted for approximately 8 of our operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 8 of our operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was derived from our two largest gpo relationships novation and premier we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect our operating revenue and results of operations 

our operating revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer at a time when the customer has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations at september 30 2006 the largest trade receivable due from a single customer represented approximately 12 of accounts receivable net 

  

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts due to us for returned goods or defective goods and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations including laws and regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees that are intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution for example the florida prescription drug pedigree laws and regulations that became effective in july 2006 imposed obligations upon us to deliver prescription drug pedigrees to various categories of customers in order to comply with the florida requirements we implemented an epedigree system at our distribution center in florida that required significant capital outlays other states are considering laws and regulations that would require us to implement pedigree capabilities in those other states similar to the pedigree capabilities implemented for florida california is considering mandating the implementation of costly track and trace chain of custody technologies such as radio frequency identification rfid technologies within the next few years even though such technologies have yet to be commercialized at the federal level the fda issued final regulations pursuant to the pharmaceutical drug marketing act that were scheduled to become effective in december 2006 the regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody requirements that increase the costs andor burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical distributors and handling product returns in early december 2006 the federal district court for the eastern district of new york issued a preliminary injunction temporarily enjoining the implementation of the regulations in response to a case initiated by secondary distributors we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this legal proceeding 

legal and regulatory changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability and adversely affect our business and results of operations 

both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts from which we derive profit based upon reimbursement rates and methodology many of these contracts cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such legal and regulatory changes accordingly such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts until the end of the applicable contract periods 

absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower growth or lower revenues for absg 

longterm care receives rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for undertaking certain activities that the manufacturers believe may increase the likelihood that their respective products will be dispensed cms continues to question pharmacies’ receipt of discounts rebates and other price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under the medicare part d benefit in a finalized “call letter” for the 2007 calendar year cms indicated it will require part d plans to have policies and systems in place as part of their drug utilization management programs to protect beneficiaries and reduce costs when longterm care pharmacies are subject to incentives to move market share through accessperformance rebates from drug manufacturers especially where such rebates exist cms instructs part d plans to require pharmacies to 

  

disclose to the part d plans any discounts rebates and other direct or indirect remuneration designed to directly or indirectly influence or impact utilization of part d drugs cms has issued guidelines regarding the information that cms will require from part d plans concerning rebates received by longterm care pharmacies 

the dra is intended to reduce net medicare and medicaid spending by approximately 11 billion over the next four to five years dra provisions could reduce payments to longterm care customers among other things the dra will reduce certain bad debt payments to medicare skilled nursing facilities and strengthen asset transfer restrictions for people seeking to qualify for medicaid longterm care coverage in addition new rules that will go into effect on january 1 2007 may decrease medicaid pharmacy reimbursement for multiplesource drugs by changing the federal upper payment limit from 150 percent of the lowest published price for a drug which is usually the wholesale acquisition cost to 250 percent of the lowest average manufacturer price there can be no assurance that the changes under the dra will not have an adverse impact on our business various administrative agencies are in the process of defining the specific details of the legislation we are continuing to work with our customers and the regulatory agencies in this process we are currently developing plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative changes if we fail to successfully develop and implement such plans this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect our results of operations 

average wholesale price or awp is a pricing benchmark published by first databank inc that is widely used to calculate a portion of the medicaid and medicare part d reimbursements payable to pharmacy providers for the drugs and biologicals they provide awp is also used to establish the pricing of pharmaceuticals to certain of our pharmaceutical distribution customers in puerto rico first databank recently agreed to a proposed settlement of a legal proceeding that would require first databank to stop publishing awp two years after the settlement becomes effective unless a competitor of first databank is publishing awp at that future time first databank would also be required to change the way it calculates awp during the twoyear interim period the settlement agreement is not final and we are evaluating the potential impact that it could have on the business of our customers and our business there can be no assurance that the settlement if approved would not have an adverse impact on the business of our customers andor our business 

the federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce medicare andor medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities at this time we can provide no assurances that such changes if adopted would not have an adverse effect on our business 

the changing united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our profitability 

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services we expect continued government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability 

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and 

  

regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

we recently acquired three pharmaceutical distributors based in canada and a provider of contract packaging and clinical trials materials services based in the united kingdom and expect to consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2007 as required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide an unqualified attestation or any attestation on management’s assessment of the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our management will be required to deliver a report in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2007 similar to the one delivered herein that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we also will be required to deliver an attestation report similar to the one delivered herein of our independent registered public accounting firm on our management’s assessment of and operating effectiveness of internal controls we have undertaken substantial effort to assess enhance and document our internal control systems financial processes and 

  

information systems and expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2007 in preparation for the required annual evaluation process significant use of resources both internal and external will be required to make the requisite evaluation of the annual effectiveness of our internal controls while we believe we have adequate internal controls and will meet our obligations there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the work necessary for our management to issue the report in a timely manner or that management or our independent registered public accounting firm will conclude that our internal controls are effective 

in addition abdc’s controls are dependent in part on the third party service provider ibm to which we have outsourced responsibility for a significant portion of our information technology activities if ibm does not perform satisfactorily andor provide the assurances to us and our independent registered public accounting firm that are required the ability of the company and the accounting firm to conclude that our internal controls are effective could be adversely affected 

our pharmaceutical distribution segment is subject to inflation in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices which subjects us to risks and uncertainties 

as part of our transition to feeforservice some distribution service agreements entered into with branded pharmaceutical manufacturers continue to have an inflationbased compensation component to them arrangements with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflationbased if the frequency or rate of branded pharmaceutical price inflation slows our results of operations could be adversely affected in addition the pharmaceutical distribution segment distributes generic pharmaceuticals which are subject to price deflation if the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates our results of operations could be adversely affected 

risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations 

our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers to receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to account for other product and service transactions with customers to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties a third party service provider ibm is responsible for managing a significant portion of abdc’s information systems our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily 

certain of our businesses are considering substantial investments in information systems during fiscal 2007 to the extent the implementation of these systems fail our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 

tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 

we are a large corporation with operations in the united states puerto rico canada and the united kingdom as such we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the united states federal state and local governments and of many foreign jurisdictions from time to time various legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions there can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these initiatives in addition united states federal state and local as well as foreign tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations there can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge 

our results of operations may suffer as a result of our proposed transaction with kindred healthcare inc “kindred” to combine our pharmerica longterm care business with kindred’s institutional pharmacy business into a new publicly traded institutional pharmacy services provider 

the proposed transaction is conditioned among other things on a favorable determination by the internal revenue service implementation of financing arrangements and registration of the common stock of the new 

  

company with the securities and exchange commission there are numerous uncertainties associated with the completion of each of these steps in the transaction in any event the proposed transaction is not expected to be completed until the first calendar quarter of 2007 during the pendency of the proposed transaction if the business focus of pharmerica longterm care personnel is diverted as a result of activities related to the transaction or if pharmerica longterm care loses any customers as a result thereof our operating results may suffer for the same reasons if we are unable to successfully complete the proposed transaction the ongoing performance and prospects of pharmerica longterm care may be adversely affected 

our earnings will suffer if we divest our pharmerica longterm care business and are not able to replace the earnings of that business 

if we divest our pharmerica longterm care business as a result of the proposed transaction we will not have the benefit of the earnings associated with that business our earnings will suffer if we are not able to replace the earnings of the pharmerica longterm care business upon the divestiture of that business there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace the earnings of the pharmerica longterm care business for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 pharmerica longterm care’s operating income was 323 million

in october 2006 the company acquired igg of america inc “igg” a specialty pharmacy and infusion services business specializing in the blood derivative ivig the addition of igg supports the company’s strategy of building its specialty pharmaceutical services to manufacturers 

in november 2006 the company acquired access md inc “amd” a canadian company that provides services including reimbursement support thirdparty logistics and nursing support services to manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals such as injectable and biological therapies the acquisition of amd expands our specialty services businesses into canada and complements the distribution services offered by abcc 

the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

pharmaceutical distribution 

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of three operating segments which include the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” the amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” and the amerisourcebergen packaging group “abpg” servicing both pharmaceutical 

  

manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes 

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products home healthcare supplies and equipment and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities clinics alternate site facilities and other customers in an effort to further protect the safety of the supply channel we purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers abdc also provides pharmacy management and consulting services and scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 

the company has transitioned its pharmaceutical distribution business to a feeforservice model whereby it is compensated for the services it provides manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases the feeforservice model is intended to improve the efficiency and transparency of the supply channel and may establish a more predictable earnings pattern for abdc while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers as of september 30 2006 abdc had signed feeforservice agreements with substantially all of the large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers during fiscal 2006 more than 75 of abdc’s brand name manufacturer gross margin was not contingent on manufacturer price increases 

absg through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states such as oncology absg also distributes vaccines other injectables plasma and other blood products in addition through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization third party logistics group purchasing services and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers reimbursement consulting data analytics practice management and physician education 

absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for absg there can be no assurance that absg will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable 

abpg consists of american health packaging anderson packaging “anderson” and brecon american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers american health packaging’s largest customer is abdc and as a result their operations are closely aligned with the operations of abdc anderson is a leading provider of contract packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers brecon is a united kingdombased provider of contract packaging and ctm services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

pharmerica 

the pharmerica segment includes the operations of the pharmerica longterm care business “longterm care” and pmsi 

longterm care is a leading national dispenser of pharmaceutical products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate site settings including skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and residential living communities longterm care’s institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment and the dispensing of those products to residents in longterm care and alternate site facilities unlike hospitals most longterm and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as longterm care to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and 

  

to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication longterm care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patientspecific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition longterm care provides infusion therapy services as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services 

the company continues to evaluate the effect that the mma transition is having on its longterm care business the mma significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries became eligible to enroll in prescription drug plans that are offered by private entities and became eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs while the above has had a positive effect on business volume during fiscal 2006 its impact has been mitigated by additional costs incurred relating to the mma transition additionally medicaid drug coverage was affected by the new medicare part d drug benefit that was implemented in 2006 since medicare part d not medicaid covers most outpatient drug expenses for beneficiaries who qualify for both medicare and medicaid coverage socalled “dual eligibles” including dual eligibles residing in nursing homes cms continues to question pharmacies’ receipt of accessperformance rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under the medicare part d benefit 

in addition the dra could reduce payments to longterm care customers among other things the dra will reduce certain bad debt payments to medicare skilled nursing facilities and strengthen asset transfer restrictions for people seeking to qualify for medicaid longterm care coverage in addition new rules that will go into effect on january 1 2007 may decrease medicaid pharmacy reimbursement for generic drugs if the company fails to successfully develop and implement such plans this change in reimbursement formula and related reporting requirements and other provisions of the dra could adversely affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

as previously discussed in october 2006 the company and kindred signed a master transaction agreement to combine their respective institutional pharmacy businesses pharmerica longterm care and kps into a new independent publicly traded company see page 23 for further details 

pmsi provides mail order and online pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers’ compensation programs and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors pmsi services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors’ administrative costs the recent addition of pmsi msa services gives the pmsi business the ability to provide its customers with a fully integrated medicare setaside solution

summary segment information 

 

  

 year ended september 30 2006 compared with year ended september 30 2005 

consolidated results 

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased 13 to 567 billion from 500 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites ie drop shipment or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites ie crossdock shipment bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 decreased 1 to 45 billion from 46 billion in the prior fiscal year due to a decrease in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products 

  

purchased and bears full risk of delivery and loss for products whether the products are dropshipped or shipped crossdock the company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery customer as a result and in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

in connection with the transition to a feeforservice model the company changed its method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives effective october 1 2004 prior to october 1 2004 abdc had recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold when earned which was primarily upon payment of vendor invoices since october 1 2004 abdc has been recording cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizing such discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold upon the sale of the inventory we believe the change in accounting method has provided a better matching of inventory cost to revenue particularly as inventory turnover rates have continued to improve the company recorded a 102 million charge for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting net of tax of 63 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 this 102 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by 005 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

gross profit of 22318 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased 13 from 19802 million in the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements and growth of our generic programs as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was 394 as compared to 396 in the prioryear this decrease was primarily due to the strong growth in business with a few of our larger lowermargin customers during the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 the company recognized gains of 409 million and 401 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these gains which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2 of gross profit for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 the company is unable to estimate future gains if any it will recognize as a result of antitrust litigation see note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further details 

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 14630 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 11 from 13153 million in the prior fiscal year the increase in dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 from the prior fiscal year was primarily related to our growth in operating revenue operating expenses of our acquired companies investments to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within abdc and sharebased compensation expense related to the current year adoption of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 123r “share based payment” as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was 258 compared to 263 in the prior fiscal year the decline in the dsada percentage in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network as a result of the optimiz ® program offset in part by investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures within abdc expenses of our acquired companies sharebased compensation expense and an increase in pharmerica’s operating expenses related to medicare part d implementation issues 

in 2001 the company developed an integration plan to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company decided to outsource a significant portion of its information technology activities as part of the integration plan during the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 the company incurred a total of approximately 21 million of 

  

transition costs which included employee severance and other contract expenses in connection with this outsourcing plan the company’s current plan is to have a distribution facility network in the us numbering in the mid20s by the end of fiscal 2007 the plan includes building six new facilities all of which have been completed and are fully operational and closing facilities 29 of which have been closed through september 30 2006 the company had a total of 28 distribution facilities in the us as of september 30 2006 the company anticipates closing two or three additional facilities in fiscal 2007 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions “the fiscal 2004 initiatives” during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company announced plans to continue to consolidate and eliminate certain administrative functions and to outsource a significant portion of the company’s information technology activities the “fiscal 2005 initiatives” 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 the company closed six distribution facilities the “fiscal 2006 initiatives” incurred expenses relating to the planned spinoff of pharmerica longterm care realized a 173 million gain from the sale of the former bergen brunswig headquarters building in orange california and incurred a charge of 139 million for an increase in a compensation accrual due to an adverse decision in an employmentrelated dispute with a former bergen brunswig chief executive officer whose employment was terminated in 1999 see bergen brunswig matter under note 12 of the consolidated financial statements for further information 

the following table illustrates the charges incurred by the company relating to facility consolidations employee severance and other for the three fiscal years ended september 30 2006 in thousands 

 

 the gain realized on the sale of the bergen brunswig headquarters and the compensation expense recognized in connection with the former bergen brunswig chief executive officer are components of the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the above table in fiscal 2006 

through september 30 2006 approximately 440 employees had been given termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2006 initiatives of which approximately 400 have been terminated as a result of the fiscal 2005 initiatives and fiscal 2004 initiatives approximately 640 employees were terminated additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced 

the company paid a total of 206 million and 135 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs in the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively related to the aforementioned integration plan remaining unpaid amounts of 279 million for employee severance lease cancellation and other costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2006 most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not to exceed 12 months while others may receive a lumpsum payment 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company recorded an impairment charge of 53 million relating to certain intangible assets held by abdc 

operating income of 7487 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 18 compared to 6369 million in the prior fiscal year the company’s operating income as a percentage of 

  

operating revenue was 132 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 compared to 127 in the prior fiscal year the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increase in gross profit in the pharmaceutical distribution segment the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other increased operating income by 208 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 and increased operating income as a percentage of operating revenue by 4 basis points the gain on antitrust litigation settlements less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other and the impairment charge increased operating income by 121 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 and increased operating income as a percentage of operating revenue by 2 basis points 

other income of 44 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 primarily included a 34 million gain resulting from an eminent domain settlement and a 31 million gain on the sale of an equity investment less losses incurred relating to another equity investment 

interest expense net decreased 78 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 to 125 million from 572 million in the prior fiscal year interest expense and interest income and their respective weightedaverage interest rates for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 were as follows in thousands 

 

 interest expense declined by 105 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of the decline in weightedaverage interest rates resulting from the company’s fiscal 2005 longterm debt refinancing interest income increased by 342 million from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 primarily as a result of an increase in the company’s average cash and shortterm investments and an increase in market interest rates the company’s average invested cash and shortterm investments during fiscal 2006 and 2005 was 13 billion and 09 billion respectively the company’s net interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in interest rates and strategic decisions made by the company to deploy its invested cash and shortterm investments 

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company recorded a 1119 million loss related to the early retirement of debt 

income tax expense of 2726 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 reflects an effective income tax rate of 368 versus 377 in the prior fiscal year the decline in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by an increase in the amount of our taxfree investments in comparison to our taxable investments including cash and cash equivalents and certain other favorable tax adjustments the company expects to have an effective income tax rate between 37 and 38 in future periods which will primarily depend on our mix of taxfree and taxable investments including cash and cash equivalents 

income from continuing operations of 4680 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 60 from 2919 million in the prior fiscal year before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of 226 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 represents a 65 increase from 137 per diluted share in the prior fiscal year before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting the gain on antitrust litigation settlements the eminent domain settlement the sale of an equity investment and the favorable tax adjustments less the costs of facility consolidations employee severance and other increased income from continuing operations by 232 million and increased diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by 011 for the fiscal year ended september 30

loss from discontinued operations of 03 million net of tax for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 relates to certain adjustments made by the company in connection with the december 2004 sale of the company’s rita ann cosmetics distribution business as well as the july 2005 sale of substantially all of the assets of bridge medical inc “bridge” loss from discontinued operations of 171 million net of tax for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 includes operating losses incurred in connection with the rita ann and bridge businesses the company incurred a 65 million loss net of tax on the sale of the rita ann business and a 46 million loss net of tax on the sale of the bridge business both of which are reflected in the loss from discontinued operations in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

net income of 4677 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 77 from 2646 million in the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share of 225 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 81 as compared to 124 per share in the prior fiscal year the increase in diluted earnings per share was greater than the increase in net income due to the reduced number of weighted average common shares outstanding resulting from the company’s purchase of its common stock in connection with its stock buyback programs see liquidity and capital resources offset in part by the increase in the number of stock option exercises 

segment information 

pharmaceutical distribution segment results 

pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of 559 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased 13 from 493 billion in the prior fiscal year the company’s acquisitions primarily abcc contributed 15 of the operating revenue growth in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 our operating revenue growth was higher than the market growth rate and was driven by growth from a few of our larger institutional customers within abdc the continued strong growth of absg principally in its distribution businesses and new customers in all customer classes during the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 58 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 42 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57 institutional and 43 retail in comparison with the prioryear results sales to institutional customers increased 16 primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and the growth of sales to a few of our larger alternatesite institutional customers within abdc sales to retail customers increased 10 over the prioryear the company’s acquisitions contributed 4 of the retail customer growth 

this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry sales in the united states as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc “ims” are expected to grow between 4 and 5 in 2007 and between 5 and 8 over the next five years ims also indicated that certain sectors of the market such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals will grow faster than the overall market as previously mentioned our revenue growth for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 exceeded market growth primarily due to the growth of a few of our larger institutional customers within abdc as well as the strong growth of absg in july 2006 the company discontinued servicing two customer accounts which contributed 12 billion and 14 billion of the segment’s operating revenue in the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively 

the company’s specialty group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth the specialty group’s operating revenue grew 33 to 99 billion for the fiscal year ended 

  

september 30 2006 from 74 billion in the prior fiscal year the majority of this group’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states such as oncology additionally the specialty group distributes vaccines plasma and other blood products the specialty group’s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the specialty group’s most significant contributor to revenue growth the specialty group’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs administered by physicians since the specialty group provides a number of services to or through physicians this could result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the specialty group 

the company currently expects that its operating revenue growth in fiscal 2007 will decline from its 13 growth rate in fiscal 2006 to a range of 7 to 9 abdc revenues are expected to grow with the overall pharmaceutical market growth rate and the absg growth rate which was 33 in fiscal 2006 is expected to decline to the midtohigh teens which is in line with the expected growth of the biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceuticals market in 2007 future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices increased downward pressure on reimbursement rates changes in federal government rules and regulations and industry growth trends such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers 

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 17237 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 15 from 14939 million in the prior fiscal year the increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in operating revenue an increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements and the growth of our generic programs as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was 308 as compared to 303 in the prior fiscal year the 5 basis point improvement was primarily due to our increase in compensation under our feeforservice agreements the growth of our generic programs and contributions from our acquisitions customer mix including the higher than average growth rate of a few of our larger lower margin customers partially offset the aforementioned improvements the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the inventory balance declined which resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in the prior year the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 306 million 

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 10795 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 12 from 9610 million in the prior fiscal year the increase in operating expenses is primarily related to our growth in operating revenue and the operating expenses of our acquired companies and sharebased compensation expense related to the current year adoption of sfas no 123r as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 were 193 as compared to 195 in the prior fiscal year as productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network as a result of our optimiz ® program were partially offset by our acquisitions our investments made to strengthen our sales and marketing and information technology infrastructures and sharebased compensation expense 

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 6442 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 21 from 5329 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was 115 as compared to 108 in the prior fiscal year the increase over the prioryear percentage was due to an increase in gross profit and reduction of operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 as compared to the prior fiscal year as discussed above 

pharmerica segment results 

pharmerica operating revenue of 16683 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 6 from 15714 million in the prior fiscal year the increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by 

  

the longterm care business which grew 7 as a result of an increase in the number of beds served higher patient acuity and drug price inflation longterm care’s operating revenues were 12115 million and 11315 million for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively pmsi operating revenue increased by 4 to 4568 million in the current fiscal year from 4399 million in the prior fiscal year the future operating revenue growth rate will likely continue to be impacted by competitive pressures changes in the regulatory environment including the reimbursement changes that have been implemented pursuant to the mma including medicare part d and the dra and the pharmaceutical inflation rate 

pharmerica gross profit of 4673 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 5 from 4462 million in the prior fiscal year and was driven by an increase in longterm care’s gross profit offset by a decline in pmsi gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was 2801 as compared to 2840 in the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures in both the longterm care and the pmsi businesses and lower rates of reimbursement for services provided by the pmsi business longterm care gross profit of 3571 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased by 8 from 3308 million in the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by the increase in operating revenue pmsi gross profit of 1102 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 decreased by 4 from 1154 million in the prior fiscal year and was primarily driven by industry competitive pressures and lower rates of reimbursement from third party payors future gross profit will likely be impacted by industry competitive pressures and continued downward pressure on rates of reimbursement for services provided by both the longterm care and pmsi businesses and the amounts of rebates available to longterm care from pharmaceutical manufacturers and the portion of any such rebates that may be retained by longterm care 

pharmerica operating expenses of 3835 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased 8 from 3543 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses increased to 2299 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 from 2254 in the prior fiscal year longterm care operating expenses of 3247 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased 10 from 2964 million in the prior fiscal year this increase was largely due to operating revenue growth an increase in bad debt expense of 145 million and additional costs related to the implementation of medicare part d under the mma which became effective on january 1 2006 longterm care’s bad debt expense increased over the prior year primarily due to billing and collection issues relating to the mma transition and the negative impact that texas medicaid changes had on certain of its nursing home customers pmsi operating expenses of 588 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 increased 2 from 579 million in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily driven by an increase in operating revenue and was partially offset by a 43 million reduction in bad debt expense primarily due to improvements made in credit and cash application management and a 32 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable settlements 

pharmerica operating income of 837 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 decreased 9 from 919 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 was 502 as compared to 585 in the prior fiscal year longterm care operating income of 323 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 decreased 6 from 345 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in its operating expenses pmsi operating income of 514 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 decreased 11 from 574 million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the decrease in its gross profit we believe that the operating margins of longterm care and pmsi will continue to be impacted by industry competitive pressures and changes in the regulatory environment

critical accounting policies and estimates 

critical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for a complete list of significant accounting policies see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements 

allowance for doubtful accounts 

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company for its pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and a reserve for customer sales returns in determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts the company considers a combination of factors such as the aging of trade receivables industry trends its customers’ financial strength and credit standing and payment and default history changes in the aforementioned factors among others may lead to adjustments in the company’s allowance for doubtful accounts the calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by company management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate 

  

realization of its trade receivables each of the company’s business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise the company writes off balances against the reserves when collectibility is deemed remote each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly and the company’s largest business units perform such reviews monthly there were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods the bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts net of writeoffs and recoveries schedule ii of this form 10k sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts 

bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended september 30 2006 2005 and 2004 was 363 million 334 million and 103 million respectively the increase in bad debt expense for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 primarily related to an increase in bad debt expense in the pharmerica reporting segment offset in part by a decline in bad debt expense in the pharmaceutical distribution reporting segment the increase in pharmerica’s bad debt expense was driven by the billing and collection issues experienced by longterm care relating to the mma transition and the negative impact that texas medicaid changes had on certain of its nursing home customers during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 bad debt expense in the pharmaceutical distribution segment was significantly impacted due to a 155 million increase in bad debt relating to one of the operating companies within the specialty group during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 debt expense was favorably impacted by a 175 million recovery from a former customer in the pharmaceutical distribution segment a 91 million recovery from a customer in the pharmerica segment and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2006 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately 38 million 

supplier reserves 

the company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due them from the company these reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims historical experience with the suppliers the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to the company the company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances an increase or decrease of 01 in the 2006 supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease in cost of goods sold by approximately 65 million the ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than the company’s estimate 

loss contingencies 

the company accrues for loss contingencies related to litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 5 “accounting for contingencies” an estimated loss contingency is accrued in the company’s consolidated financial statements if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events the company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related disclosures the amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates 

merchandise inventories 

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 83 and 87 of the company’s inventories at september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively are determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if the company had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which 

  

approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 1526 million and 1598 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2006 and 2005 respectively during the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 inventory balances declined which resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2005 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 306 million and increase diluted earnings per share by 009 the effect of the liquidation in fiscal 2004 was to decrease cost of goods sold by 103 million and increase diluted earnings per share by 003 

business combinations 

in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 141 “business combinations” the purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill the company engages thirdparty appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed such valuations require management to make significant judgments estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships trade names existing technology and other intangible assets and discount rates unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual events 

goodwill and intangible assets 

the company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements patents and software technology will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets under sfas no 142 a determination of the fair value of the company’s reporting units and intangible assets is required the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets and record any resulting impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value this impairment test requires the projection and discounting of cash flows analysis of the company’s market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities estimating future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon among other things certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined by management the company’s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to among other things economic conditions changes to the business model or changes in operating performance significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect the company’s future financial results the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and as a result did not record any significant impairment charges 

during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 the company performed an impairment test on certain intangible assets within the technology operations of abdc due to the existence of impairment indicators as a result the company recorded an impairment charge of 53 million relating to certain of those intangible assets the charge was reflected in the company’s results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the company completed its required annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 and determined that there was no impairment 

  

sharebased compensation 

in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 the company adopted sfas no 123r “sharebased payment” using the modifiedprospective transition method and therefore began to expense the fair value of all options over their remaining vesting periods to the extent the options were not fully vested as of the adoption date and began to expense the fair value of all sharebased compensation awards granted subsequent to september 30 2005 over their requisite service periods the company utilizes a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of sharebased compensation expense which involves the use of several assumptions including expected term of the option future volatility dividend yield and forfeiture rate the expected term of options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the company’s stock as well as other factors such as implied volatility 

income taxes 

the company’s income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and income tax reserves reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes 

the company has established a net valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually after application of the valuation allowances described above the company anticipates that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other net deferred income tax assets described above 

in addition the company has established an estimated liability for federal state and nonus income tax exposures that arise and meet the criteria for accrual under sfas no 5 “accounting for uncertainties” the company prepares and files tax returns based on its interpretation of tax laws and regulations and records estimates based on these judgments and interpretations in the normal course of business the company’s tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation regulation andor as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems 

the company has developed a methodology for estimating its tax liability related to such matters and has consistently followed such methodology from period to period the liability amounts for such matters are based on an evaluation of the underlying facts and circumstances a thorough research of the technical merits of the company’s arguments and an assessment of the probability of the company prevailing in its arguments in all cases the company considers previous findings of the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities 

the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and tax contingency reserves are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances however others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued 

the significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year if any of the company’s assumptions or estimates were to change an increase or decrease in the company’s effective tax rate by 1 on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by 74 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2006 

  

liquidity and capital resources 

the following table illustrates the company’s debt structure at september 30 2006 including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 

 

 the company’s 16 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facilities and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund the company’s working capital requirements the company’s aggregate availability was reduced to 13 billion as of november 14 2006 because the company elected to replace its existing revolving credit facilities with a new fiveyear multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility and the company further amended its receivables securitization facility such that the amount to be made available was reduced from 700 million to 500 million see further details regarding these matters below 

on november 14 2006 the company entered into a new 750 million fiveyear multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility the “multicurrency revolving credit facility” with a syndicate of lenders the multicurrency revolving credit facility replaced the senior revolving credit facility the uk credit facility and the canadian credit facility all of which are defined below interest on borrowings denominated in us dollars under the multicurrency revolving credit facility will accrue at specified rates based on the company’s debt rating initially at 50 basis points over libor or the prime rate interest on borrowings for any euro loan accrues at euribor plus a specified rate and for any sterling loan at libor plus a specified rate the specified rates are based on the company’s debt ratings and range from 19 basis points to 60 basis points over libor or euribor as applicable interest on borrowings denominated in canadian dollars accrues at the greater of the canadian prime rate or the cdor rate the company will pay quarterly facility fees to maintain the availability under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at specific rates based on the company’s debt rating ranging from 6 basis points to 15 basis points of the total commitment this rate was 125 basis points as of november 14 2006 in connection with entering into the multicurrency revolving credit facility the company incurred approximately 10 million of costs which were deferred and will be amortized over the life of the facility the company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the multicurrency revolving credit facility at any time the covenants under the multicurrency revolving credit facility are less restrictive than those under the senior revolving credit facility thereby providing the company with greater financial flexibility the multicurrency revolving credit facility contains covenants that require compliance with financial tests including leverage and minimum earnings to fixed charges ratios 

  

the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility which was scheduled to expire in april 2006 was amended and now expires in april 2007 the 55 million blanco revolving credit facility is included in the “within 1 year” column in the repayment table on page 44 however the borrowing is not classified in the current portion of longterm debt on the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2006 because the company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a longterm basis 

in march 2006 the company entered into a £20 million multicurrency revolving credit facility the “uk credit facility” due march 2009 with a financial institution in connection with the company’s acquisition of brecon the company utilized amounts available to it under the new multicurrency revolving credit facility to repay its outstanding balance under the uk credit facility and terminated this facility in november 2006

market risk

 item 1 business tableend   

amerisourcebergen corporation “amerisourcebergen” or the “company” is one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states serving both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the company provides drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers located throughout the united states including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities physicians clinics and other alternate site facilities and skilled nursing and assisted living centers we also provide pharmaceuticals and pharmacy services to longterm care workers’ compensation and specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services including pharmacy automation supply management software pharmaceutical packaging inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and physician education all of which are designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes 

  

industry overview 

  

we have benefited from the significant growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states according to ims healthcare inc an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales in the united states are expected to grow between 8 and 9 in 2006 and annually between 7 and 10 through 2009 

  

the factors contributing to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other industry trends include 

  

aging population  the number of individuals over age 55 in the united states grew from approximately 52 million in 1990 to approximately 59 million in 2000 and is projected to increase to more than 75 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from chronic illnesses and disabilities more than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene research and therapy continue to generate new compounds and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases these compounds have been responsible for significant increases in pharmaceutical sales we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry 

  

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies 

  

pharmaceutical supply channel changes historically we and our major pharmaceutical distribution competitors derived a significant portion of our pharmaceutical distribution gross margin from manufacturer price increases which have historically equaled or exceeded the overall consumer price index we believe these increases were due in large part to the relatively inelastic demand for brand name drugs notwithstanding higher prices charged for patented drugs as pharmaceutical manufacturers attempted to recoup costs associated with the development clinical testing and regulatory approval of new products recently pharmaceutical manufacturers have been under significant pressure to reduce the rate of pharmaceutical price increases while we expect such price increases to occur in the future we cannot predict the rate at which such prices will increase or the frequency of increases 

  

our industry is in a transition to a feeforservice model whereby we and our major competitors are compensated for the services provided to manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases there can be no assurance that the feeforservice transition will be successful or that our profitability will not be significantly reduced by the transition see further description of business model transition on page 6 under the section titled “suppliers” 

  

medicare and medicaid legislative developments medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals were impacted by implementation of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare modernization act” by the us department of health and human services “hhs” and further medicare reimbursement reductions and policy changes are scheduled to be implemented in the future in addition the us congress is considering reductions in medicaid reimbursement for certain prescription drugs these policies may adversely affect our specialty distribution and our longterm care institutional pharmacy businesses directly and our wholesale drug distribution and specialty distribution businesses indirectly 

  

expiration of patents for brand name pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widelyused brand name pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years these products are expected to be marketed by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributed by distributors like us we consider this a favorable trend because generic products have historically provided a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand name products 

  

the company 

  

the company was formed by the merger of amerisource health corporation “amerisource” and bergen brunswig corporation “bergen” in august 2001 we currently serve our customers including healthcare providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and patients throughout the united states and puerto rico and recently canada through a geographically diverse network of distribution and service centers we typically are the primary source of supply for pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers and certain patients we offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel 

  

strategy 

  

our business strategy is focused solely on the pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide valueadded distribution and service solutions to healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase channel efficiencies and improve patient outcomes implementing this disciplined focused strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business and we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

operations 

  

operating structure we are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers and substantially all of our operations are in the united states the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

  

the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” and the amerisourcebergen specialty and packaging groups the operations of the former amerisourcebergen technology group became a part of the overall abdc operations in fiscal 2005 the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services throughout the united states puerto rico and canada as a result of the trent acquisition abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities physicians clinics and other alternate site facilities abdc also provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services including group purchasing services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states including oncology nephrology and rheumatology absg also distributes vaccines other injectables plasma and other blood products in addition through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization third party logistics and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers reimbursement consulting practice management and physician education the amerisourcebergen packaging group consists of american health packaging and anderson packaging “anderson” american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers the drug distribution operations of abdc and absg comprised over 90 of the segment’s operating revenue and over 80 of the segment’s operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

  

the pharmerica segment includes the operations of the pharmerica longterm care business “longterm care” and a workers’ compensationrelated business “workers’ compensation” longterm care is a leading national provider of pharmacy products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate site settings including skilled nursing facilities 

  

assisted living facilities and residential living communities longterm care’s institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment and the dispensing of those products to residents in longterm care and alternate site facilities unlike hospitals most longterm and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as longterm care to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication longterm care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patient specific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition longterm care provides infusion therapy services and medicare part b products as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services workers’ compensation provides mail order and online pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers’ compensation programs and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors workers’ compensation services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors’ administrative costs 

  

sales and marketing abdc has a sales force organized regionally and specialized by healthcare provider type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner abdc also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings our specialty and packaging groups and the pharmerica businesses each have independent sales forces that specialize in its respective product and service offerings our corporate marketing department designs and develops an array of amerisourcebergen valueadded healthcare provider solutions and marketing materials tailored to specific groups these programs and materials can be further customized at the distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions corporate sales and marketing also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and with the management of the specialty and packaging groups corporate sales and marketing ensures that our customers are receiving the mix of service offerings that meet their needs 

  

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm and alternate care facilities and physician offices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our customers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers during fiscal 2005 operating revenue for our pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of 57 institutional and 43 retail 

  

our top ten customers represented approximately 31 of fiscal 2005 operating revenue our largest nonbulk customer represented 75 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2005 revenues generated from sales to medco health solutions inc “medco” accounted for approximately 93 of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and approximately 6 of operating revenue in fiscal 2005 other than our largest nonbulk customer and medco no individual customer accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2005 operating revenue in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 13 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2005 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships novation llc united drugs and premier purchasing partners lp the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future operating revenue in october 2005 abdc received notice of termination of its gpo contract with united drugs effective middecember 2005 united drugs is a gpo for independent retail pharmacies we expect that a substantial majority of the members of united drugs will terminate their affiliation with united drugs and elect to continue to do business with us among other things the majority of the members of united drugs are participants in one or more of our retail programs including good neighbor pharmacy ®  performance plus network ® and diabetes shoppe ®  and a number of them also have separate contracts directly with us however there can be no assurance that we will retain a substantial majority of the members of united drugs as customers following the termination of our contract with united drugs purchases by the members of united drugs represented approximately 4 of the company’s operating revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

  

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 7 of our purchases in fiscal 2005 the loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally good the ten largest suppliers in fiscal 2005 accounted for approximately 42 of our purchases effective october 1 2005 the company voluntarily made a decision to purchase all pharmaceuticals directly from manufacturers in an effort to further protect the integrity of the supply channel 

  

abdc is in a business model transition with respect to how manufacturers compensate us for our services historically supplier arrangements allowed us to generate gross profit in several ways including cash discounts for prompt payments 

  

inventory buying opportunities rebates inventory management and other agreements vendor program arrangements negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities a significant portion of abdc’s gross margin had been derived from our ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases and to hold these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increase thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories over the last two years pharmaceutical manufacturers have been increasing their control over the pharmaceutical supply channel by using product allocation methods including the imposition of inventory management agreements “imas” under a typical ima arrangement the company is compensated based on specific contract defined formulas for maintaining a certain level of inventory for a predefined period prior to as of or subsequent to the date of a manufacturer price increase the payment from the manufacturer to us is triggered upon the manufacturer price increase because the payment trigger is the date of the manufacturer price increase and the size of the payment is typically dependent on the percentage price increase changes in manufacturers’ pricing patterns can cause significant volatility to the company’s periodic earnings additionally pharmaceutical manufacturers have been imposing restrictions on our ability to purchase their products from alternate sources and have been requesting more product and distribution sales data from us 

  

all of the above has led to significant volatility in abdc’s gross margin and therefore we are continuing our efforts to shift our pharmaceutical distribution business to a feeforservice model where we are compensated for the services we provide manufacturers rather than one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases as is the case with the ima model we continue to work with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to define feeforservice terms that will adequately compensate us for our services such as our distribution services inventory management service level management and other services under a typical feeforservice agreement the company is compensated for its services based on a percentage of purchases over a defined time period with payment of fees being made directly or through a combination of direct payments and price increase entitlements as of september 30 2005 we have signed agreements with a number of the large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that we consider feeforservice arrangements as well as some that we consider hybrid agreements with some attributes of imas and some attributes of feeforservice arrangements we believe the transition to a feeforservice model will improve the efficiency of the supply channel and may establish a more predictable earnings pattern for abdc while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers the feeforservice arrangements may establish a more predictable earnings pattern because under many of the agreements the company earns a fee for its services performed on a monthly basis in contrast to the ima model where earnings are largely predicated upon the timing and amount of pharmaceutical price increases we continue to have discussions with pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding feeforservice arrangements and expect to have agreements in place with a substantial majority of the large branded manufacturers by the end of calendar 2005 during fiscal 2006 we expect that more than 75 of abdc’s brand name manufacturer gross margin will not be contingent on manufacturer price increases however there can be no assurance that this business model transition will provide all of the desired benefits or that the company will be able to retain those benefits 

  

information systems abdc’s information systems provide for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s customized systems strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels 

  

abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities on two different centralized information systems while continuing to migrate to one system and maintaining our customers’ access through either orderentry system abdc plans to complete its migration to one system in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 

  

abdc plans to continue to make system investments to further improve its information capabilities and meet its customer and operational needs abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc is implementing a new warehouse operating system that is expected to improve its productivity and operating leverage abdc will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology as of september 30 2005 approximately onethird of our distribution facilities have successfully implemented the new warehouse operating system 

  

in an effort to maintain and improve its information technology infrastructure the company decided to outsource a significant portion of its corporate and abdc information technology activities and entered into a tenyear commitment effective july 1 2005 with ibm global services “ibm” which will assume responsibility for performing the outsourced information technology activities following the completion of certain transition matters the company estimates that it will incur approximately 20 million to 25 million of transition costs in connection with this plan these transition costs will include employee severance and other contract expenses the company incurred approximately onehalf of these costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 the minimum commitment under the outsourcing arrangement is approximately 200 million excluding 

  

the abovementioned transition costs over a tenyear period however the company believes it will likely spend between 300 million and 400 million under the outsourcing arrangement to maintain and improve its information technology infrastructure during that period 

  

absg operates its specialty distribution business on a common centralized erp platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the last three years we have introduced and enhanced our web capabilities such that currently more than 30 of orders are initiated on the web 

  

pharmerica’s longterm care business operates a proprietary information technology infrastructure that automates order entry of medications dispensing of medications invoicing and payment processing these systems provide medical records consulting drug review and regulatory compliance information to help ensure patient safety pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business provides proprietary information technology for workers’ compensation solutions these systems provide eligibility authorization and reimbursement payments to participating pharmacies they also provide order taking shipment and collection of service fees for medications and specialty services the systems also provide billing and reimbursement for other services rendered pharmerica continues to invest in technologies that help improve data integrity critical information access and system availability 

  

competition 

  

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions abdc competes with both national and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution our national competitors include cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation in addition we compete with regional and local distributors directselling manufacturers warehousing chain drugstores specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the provider and alternate site product distribution channels serviced by absg are also highly competitive specialty distribution channel competitors include oncology therapeutics network fff enterprises henry schein inc medpath and priority healthcare corporation among others competitors in the business of providing specialty pharmaceutical services to manufacturers include us oncology inc covance inc and ups logistics among others in all areas competitive factors include price valueadded service programs product offerings service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

  

pharmerica’s competitors principally include omnicare inc a national competitor which is significantly larger than pharmerica as well as regional and local pharmacies that specialize in longterm care we believe that the competitive factors most important in pharmerica’s lines of business are quality and range of service offered pricing reputation with referral sources ease of doing business with the provider and the ability to develop and maintain relationships with referral sources in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry in the local markets served by pharmerica and it may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants pharmerica also competes with numerous billing companies in connection with the portion of its business that electronically adjudicates workers’ compensation claims for payors 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

  

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

  

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and our medication and supply dispensing equipment we seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

  

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

  

employees 

  

as of september 30 2005 we employed approximately 13400 persons of which approximately 12300 were fulltime employees approximately 5 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 

  

government regulation 

  

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances wholesale distributors of these substances are required to register for permits meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the fda dea and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these regulations we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements 

  

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws which prohibit among other things a persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other government healthcare programs and b physicians from making referrals to certain entities with whom they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation the operations of pharmerica and the specialty group are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain aspects of our pharmaceutical distribution operations 

  

under the prospective payment system “pps” for medicare patients in skilled nursing facilities medicare pays a federal daily rate for virtually all covered skilled nursing facility services under pps pharmerica’s longterm care skilled nursing facility customers are not able to pass through to medicare their costs for certain products and services provided by pharmerica instead medicare provides such customers a federal daily rate to cover the costs of all covered goods and services provided to medicare patients which may include certain pharmaceutical and other goods and services provided by pharmerica because this medicare reimbursement is limited by pps facility customers have an increased incentive to negotiate with pharmerica to minimize the costs of providing goods and services to patients covered under medicare pharmerica bills skilled nursing facilities based on a negotiated fee schedule 

  

the medicare modernization act reduced medicare payments for most part b drugs from 95 percent to 85 percent of average wholesale price “awp” for 2004 and instituted an “average sales price” or “asp” methodology beginning in 2005 beginning on july 1 2006 physicians will have the option of continuing to obtain part b reimbursed drugs under the traditional “buy and bill” approach or acquiring drugs through a new competitive acquisition program or cap it is currently anticipated that physicians who participate in cap will bill the medicare program only for the drug administration while the cap vendor will bill medicare for the actual cap drug and also will collect applicable beneficiary copayments 

  

the medicare modernization act also significantly expanded medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs specifically on january 1 2006 the new voluntary medicare part d prescription drug benefit will go into effect beneficiaries who choose to participate in part d will select from a range of standalone prescription drug plans or medicare advantage managed care plans that include prescription drug coverage along with other medicare services “part d plans” the part d plans will be required to make available certain drugs on their formularies reimbursement for part d drugs will be negotiated by each part d plan 

  

pharmerica’s longterm care business also receives reimbursement directly for dispensed pharmaceuticals in some cases under state medicaid programs over the last several years state medicaid programs have lowered reimbursement through a variety of mechanisms principally reductions in average wholesale price awp levels expansion of federal upper limit ful pricing and general reductions in contract payment methodology to pharmacies congress also is considering budget reconciliation legislation that would further reduce medicaid reimbursement for pharmaceuticals although to date congress has not adopted a final budget package moreover medicaid drug coverage will be affected by the new medicare part d drug benefit to be implemented in 2006 since medicare part d not medicaid will cover most outpatient drug expenses for beneficiaries who qualify for both medicare and medicaid coverage socalled “dual eligibles” including dual eligibles residing in nursing homes 

  

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel for example florida and other states are implementing pedigree requirements that require drugs to be accompanied by paperwork tracing drugs back to the manufacturers these and other requirements are expected to increase the company’s cost of operations effective october 1 2005 the company voluntarily made a decision to purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers in an effort to further protect the integrity of the supply channel 

  

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

see “certain risk factors” for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

health information practices 

  

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder by hhs set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of these standards we have a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

  

certain risk factors 

  

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  

intense competition may erode our profit margins 

  

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals such as cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers who distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and other healthcare providers the longterm care and workers’ compensation businesses in which pharmerica operates also are highly competitive 

  

competitive pressures have contributed to a decline in our gross profit margins on operating revenue from 542 in fiscal 2001 to 396 in fiscal 2005 this trend may continue and our business could be adversely affected as a result 

  

our operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

  

our top ten customers represented approximately 31 of operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 our largest individual customer accounted for approximately 75 of our operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 we also have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are hospitals pharmacies or other healthcare providers approximately 13 of our operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships novation llc united drugs and premier purchasing partners lp we may lose a significant customer or gpo relationship if any existing contract with such customer or gpo expires without being extended renewed renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or gpo prior to expiration to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract a number of our contracts with significant customers or gpos are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or gpo relationships if we are unable to extend renew renegotiate or replace the contracts the loss of any significant customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future operating revenue and profitability in october 2005 abdc received notice of termination of its gpo contract with united drugs effective middecember 2005 united drugs is a gpo for independent retail pharmacies we expect that a substantial majority of the members of united drugs will terminate their affiliation with united drugs and elect to continue to do business with us among other things the majority of the members of united drugs are participants in one or more of our retail programs including good neighbor pharmacy ®  performance plus network ® and diabetes shoppe ®  and a number of them also have separate contracts directly with us however there can be no 

  

assurance that we will retain a substantial majority of the members of united drugs as customers following the termination of our contract with united drugs purchases by the members of united drugs represented approximately 4 of the company’s operating revenues for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

  

approximately 11 of pharmerica’s operating revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was derived from longterm care’s contract with beverly enterprises inc the initial term of this contract is scheduled to expire in the middle part of fiscal 2006 and the contract is expected to be renewed at or before the expiration of the initial term a termination of this contract or a renewal of this contract on significantly less favorable economic terms would adversely affect pharmerica’s operating revenue and results of operations 

  

our operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

  

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer at a time when the customer has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations at september 30 2005 the largest trade receivable due from a single customer represented approximately 13 of accounts receivable net 

  

our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant supplier 

  

our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers including amounts due to us for returned goods or defective goods and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 

  

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution segment is transitioning its business model 

  

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution segment is in a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for services it provides to pharmaceutical manufacturers historically supplier arrangements allowed us to generate gross profit in several ways including cash discounts for prompt payments inventory buying opportunities rebates inventory management and other agreements vendor program arrangements negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities 

  

a significant portion of the gross margin for our pharmaceutical business had been derived from our ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and then hold these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increase thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories over the last two years however pharmaceutical manufacturers have been increasing their control over the pharmaceutical supply channel by using product allocation methods including imposition of inventory management agreements “imas” under most imas we are paid for not speculating with respect to pharmaceutical price increases however in most cases our compensation under imas continues to be predicated upon pharmaceutical price increases additionally pharmaceutical manufacturers have imposed restrictions on our ability to purchase their products from alternate sources effective october 1 2005 the company voluntarily made a decision to purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers in an effort to further protect the integrity of the supply channel 

  

all of the above has resulted in significant volatility in the gross margin for our pharmaceutical distribution business and therefore we are in an effort to shift our business to a feeforservice model where we are compensated for the services we provide manufacturers rather than one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases as is the case with the ima model we have been and are continuing to work with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to define feeforservice terms that will adequately compensate us for our services we expect to have agreements—either feeforservice agreements or hybrid agreements that have some attributes of imas and some attributes of feeforservice agreements—in place with a substantial majority of the large branded manufacturers by the end of calendar 2005 during fiscal 2006 we expect that more than 75 of abdc’s brand name manufacturer gross margin will not be contingent on manufacturer price increases there can be no assurance that this business model transition will be successful or that the timing of that transition will occur as anticipated by the company if the transition does not proceed successfully the company may not be adequately compensated and its profitability may be significantly reduced 

  

the supply channel business model transition may reduce our profitability 

  

the supply channel business model transition described above has the potential to affect the profitability of customer contracts that were developed under a business model that was predicated on price increases and high inventory levels many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts that cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such changes in our relationships with manufacturers accordingly the advent of such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts through the end of the applicable contract periods 

  

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations including pedigree tracking requirements that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution 

  

legal and regulatory changes affecting rates of reimbursement for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability 

  

both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts from which we derive profit based upon reimbursement rates and methodology many of these contracts cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such legal and regulatory changes accordingly such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts until the end of the applicable contract periods 

  

absg’s business may be adversely affected in the future by recent and proposed changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs the reimbursement changes that have been implemented by hhs starting in january 2004 and continuing in 2005 pursuant to the medicare modernization act along with additional reforms scheduled to go into effect in 2006 may have the effect of reducing the amount of andor margins on medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers in particular under the upcoming competitive acquisition program or cap physicians may choose to forgo purchasing drugs for medicare patients and instead opt to obtain products from a cap vendor that bills medicare directly since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower growth or lower revenues for absg although absg has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable 

  

the medicare modernization act also includes a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under the new medicare part d beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries will be eligible to enroll in prescription drug plans that will be offered by private entities and will be eligible for varying levels of coverage for outpatient prescription drugs medicare beneficiaries who will have all or a substantial portion of their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit include those nursing home residents served by the longterm care business whose drug costs are currently covered by state medicaid programs in january 2005 the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” of hhs published final rules for the new voluntary prescription drug benefit program while these rules established a framework for the new benefit further information and guidance continues to be provided by cms the rules permit longterm care pharmacies to provide covered medicare part d drugs to enrollees of the new medicare part d plans under the rules longterm care pharmacies will be able to participate on an innetwork basis by contracting directly with the plan sponsor the changes contemplated by the rules are expected to take full effect in 2006 at this time we cannot determine the future impact of medicare part d on the longterm care business but the implementation of medicare part d could have an adverse effect on the longterm care business 

  

longterm care receives rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers for undertaking certain activities that the manufacturers believe may increase the likelihood that their respective products will be dispensed   in answer to a frequently asked question “faq” cms recently indicated that it is examining whether longterm care pharmacies should be permitted to receive “accessperformance” rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to prescriptions covered under the medicare part d benefit cms defined these as rebates that manufacturers provide to longterm pharmacies that are designed to “prefer protect or maintain” that manufacturers’ product selection by the longterm care pharmacy or to increase the volume of the manufacturers’ products that are dispensed by 

  

the pharmacy under its formulary cms subsequently withdrew the faq and to date has not provided any additional guidance on this issue the elimination of manufacturer rebates could have an adverse effect on the longterm care business longterm care’s business could be adversely affected if cms should take any action that has the effect of eliminating or significantly reducing the rebates that longterm care receives from manufacturers 

  

the changing united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our revenue and income 

  

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our income 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

  

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting the medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our integration plan to consolidate our distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions 

  

we are proceeding with an integration plan to consolidate our abdc distribution facilities from 51 to a distribution facility network numbering in the mid20’s within the next two years implement new warehouse information technology systems and eliminate duplicative administrative functions the program is designed to focus capacity on growing markets significantly increase warehouse efficiencies and streamline our transportation activities the plan includes building six new facilities four of which were operational as of september 30 2005 closing facilities twentythree of which have been closed as of september 30 2005 and implementing a new warehouse operating system the fifth new facility opened in october 2005 and the sixth facility is scheduled to open during fiscal 2006 we closed a total of six facilities during fiscal 2005 and we expect to close an additional six facilities during fiscal 2006 thereby reducing the total number of distribution facilities to 28 by the end of fiscal 2006 we believe our enhanced distribution network will result in the lowest costs in pharmaceutical distribution and the highest accuracy and speed of customer order fulfillment we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of enhancing our distribution network if we experience delays in building the new facilities or closing existing facilities we incur significant cost overruns associated with the program or the new warehouse information technology systems do not function as planned 

  

effective july 1 2005 we outsourced a significant portion of our information technology activities to ibm as part of the integration plan there can be no assurance that our business operations will not be affected adversely by the outsourcing of such activities or that ibm will perform satisfactorily 

  

our operating results andor financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

  

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

  

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  

our operating results and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign operations 

  

we recently acquired a pharmaceutical distributor based in canada and expect to consider additional foreign acquisitions in the future our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition as described above at any particular time foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the governmental political economic business and competitive environment within the countries in which those operations are based additionally foreign operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar 

  

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 as required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide an unqualified attestation or any attestation on management’s assessment of the operating effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting  

  

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our management will be required to deliver a report in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2006 similar to the one delivered herein that assesses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting we also will be required to deliver an attestation report similar to the one delivered herein of our independent registered public accounting firm on our management’s assessment of and operating effectiveness of internal controls we have undertaken substantial effort to assess enhance and document our internal control systems financial processes and information systems and expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2006 in preparation for the required annual evaluation process significant use of resources both internal and external will be required to make the requisite evaluation of the annual effectiveness of the company’s internal controls while the company believes it has adequate internal controls and will meet its obligations there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the work necessary for the company’s management to issue its report in a timely manner or that management or the company’s independent registered public accounting firm will conclude that the company’s internal controls are effective 

  

risks generally associated with the company’s sophisticated information systems may adversely affect the company’s operating results 

  

the company relies on sophisticated information systems in its business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers receive to process and ship orders on a timely basis to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties a third party service provider is responsible for managing a significant portion of the company’s information systems the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third party service provider does not perform satisfactorily

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 

  

the company is a national pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its customers the company also provides pharmaceuticals to longterm care and workers’ compensation patients 

  

the company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers and substantially all of its operations are located in the united states the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

  

pharmaceutical distribution 

  

the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment includes the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” and the amerisourcebergen specialty and packaging groups the operations of the former amerisourcebergen technology group became a part of the overall abdc operations in fiscal 2005 the pharmaceutical distribution reportable segment is comprised of two operating segments abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” the abdc operating segment includes the operations of the amerisourcebergen packaging group servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes throughout the united states and puerto rico the drug distribution operations of abdc and absg comprised over 90 of the segment’s operating revenue and over 80 of the segment’s operating income in fiscal 2005 

  

abdc distributes a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities physicians clinics and other alternate site facilities 

  

abdc is in a business model transition with respect to how manufacturers compensate us for our services historically supplier arrangements allowed us to generate gross profit in several ways including cash discounts for prompt payments inventory buying opportunities rebates inventory management and other agreements vendor program arrangements negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities a significant portion of abdc’s gross margin had been derived from our ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and then hold these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increase thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories over the last two years pharmaceutical manufacturers have been increasing their control over the pharmaceutical supply channel by using product allocation methods including the imposition of inventory management agreements “imas” under a typical ima arrangement the company is compensated based on specific contract defined formulas for maintaining a certain level of inventory for a predefined period prior to as of or subsequent to the date of a manufacturer price increase the payment is triggered upon the manufacturer price increase and is recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold over the longer of the product sellthrough period or postprice increase monitoring period because the payment trigger is the date of the manufacturer price increase and the size of the payment is typically dependent on the percentage price increase changes in manufacturers’ pricing patterns can cause significant volatility to the company’s periodic earnings additionally pharmaceutical manufacturers imposed restrictions on our ability to purchase their products from alternate sources and have been requesting more product and distribution sales data from us effective october 1 2005 the company voluntarily made a decision to purchase all pharmaceuticals only from manufacturers in an effort to further protect the integrity of the supply channel 

  

all of the above has led to significant volatility in abdc’s gross margin and therefore we are continuing our efforts to shift our pharmaceutical distribution business to a feeforservice model where we are compensated for the services we provide manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases as is the case with the ima model we continue to work with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to define feeforservice terms that will adequately compensate us for our services such as our distribution services inventory management service level management and other services under a typical feeforservice agreement the company is compensated for its services based on a percentage of purchases over a defined time period amounts due for services rendered in the current period would typically be earned in the following month as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the related product is sold as of september 30 2005 we have signed agreements with a number of the 

  

large branded pharmaceutical manufacturers that we consider feeforservice arrangements as well as some that we consider hybrid agreements with some attributes of imas and some attributes of feeforservice arrangements we believe the transition to a feeforservice model will improve the efficiency of the supply channel and may establish a more predictable earnings pattern for abdc while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers the feeforservice arrangements may establish a more predictable earnings pattern because under many of the agreements the company earns a fee for its services performed on a monthly basis in contrast to the ima model where earnings are largely predicated upon the timing and amount of pharmaceutical price increases we continue to have discussions with pharmaceutical manufacturers regarding feeforservice arrangements and expect to have agreements in place with a substantial majority of the large branded manufacturers by the end of calendar 2005 during fiscal 2006 we expect that more than 75 of abdc’s brand name manufacturer gross margin will not be contingent on manufacturer price increases the business model transition has had the effect of reducing merchandise inventories because ima and feeforservice agreements both limit the amount of inventory we can carry and as a result we have experienced a significant increase in cash flow from operations the majority of the reduction in merchandise inventories has been realized as of september 30 2005 as days held in inventory have decreased from 50 days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to 42 days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to 32 days during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005 in fiscal 2006 we would expect merchandise inventories to stabilize as the large majority of branded manufacturers are expected to be under some form of feeforservice contract and as a result we would expect future cash flow from operations to track more closely to net income 

  

abdc also provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment medication and supply dispensing cabinets and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers 

  

absg through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services including group purchasing services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states including oncology nephrology and rheumatology absg also distributes vaccines other injectables plasma and other blood products in addition through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization third party logistics and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers reimbursement consulting practice management and physician education 

  

absg’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs the reimbursement changes that have been implemented by the us department of health and human services “hhs” pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare modernization act” and that are scheduled to be implemented in the future may have the effect of reducing the amount andor margins of medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers since absg provides a number of services to or through physicians patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for absg although absg has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable

the company is currently evaluating the effect that the medicare modernization act may have on the longterm care business the ongoing implementation of medicare part d including coverage and reimbursement changes associated with the voluntary drug benefit program for seniors could have an adverse effect on the longterm care business at this time the future impact of the medicare modernization act on the longterm care business cannot be determined

consolidated results 

  

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 increased 2 to 500 billion from 488 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 increased 6 to 46 billion from 43 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has general inventory risk physical loss inventory risk and customer credit risk as a result and in accordance with the emerging issues task force no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

  

in connection with the transition to a feeforservice model we changed our method of recognizing cash discounts and other related manufacturer incentives effective october 1 2004 abdc previously recognized cash discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold when earned which was primarily upon payment of vendor invoices abdc now records cash discounts as a component of inventory cost and recognizes such discounts as a reduction of cost of goods sold upon the sale of the inventory we believe the change in accounting method provides a more objectively determinable method of recognizing cash discounts and a better matching of inventory cost to revenue as inventory turnover rates are expected to continue to improve 

  

we recorded a 102 million charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting net of tax of 63 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 this 102 million cumulative effect charge reduced diluted earnings per share by 009 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the accounting change is incorporated in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 the change improved earnings from continuing operations in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 by approximately 115 million net of tax or 011 per diluted share from continuing operations the accounting change had the effect of increasing gross profit and operating income by 185 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 

  

gross profit of 19802 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 decreased 9 from 21664 million in the prior fiscal year during the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 the company recognized gains of 401 million and 380 million respectively from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers these gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold and contributed 2 of gross profit for the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was 396 as compared to the prioryear percentage of 444 the decrease in gross profit and gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical price increases and other buyside profits changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures 

  

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 13153 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 reflects an increase of 46 from 12580 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was 263 compared to 258 in the prior fiscal year the increase in the dsada and the dsada percentage in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 from the prior fiscal year was due to an increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment dsada including bad debt expenses total bad debt expense increased to 334 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 from a benefit of 103 million in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a 155 million increase in bad debt expense relating to one of the operating companies within the specialty group additionally the prior year’s bad debt expense was favorably impacted by 266 million of customer recoveries

pharmaceutical distribution segment results 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of 493 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 increased 3 from 481 billion in the prior fiscal year in fiscal 2004 the company discontinued servicing the us department of veterans affairs “va” and advancepcs these former customers contributed 48 and 44 respectively of the segment’s operating revenue in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the lost business was offset by the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business and the market growth of abdc during the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 57 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 43 was from sales to retail customers this compared to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 59 institutional and 41 retail in comparison with the prioryear results sales to institutional customers were flat primarily due to the above market growth of the specialty pharmaceutical distribution business offset by the loss of the va and advancepcs business sales to retail customers increased 7 over the prioryear primarily due to market growth and an increase in sales to one of the company’s larger retail customers 

  

this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry sales in the united states as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc are expected to grow between 8 and 9 in 2006 and annually between 7 and 10 through 2009 future operating revenue growth will continue to be affected by competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices changes in federal government rules and regulations and industry growth trends such as the likely increase in the number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand manufacturers the company’s specialty group has been growing at rates in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth the majority of this group’s revenue is generated 

  

from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states such as oncology nephrology and rheumatology additionally the specialty group distributes vaccines and blood plasma the specialty group’s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the specialty group’s most significant contributor to revenue growth the specialty group’s business may be adversely impacted in the future by changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs the reimbursement changes that have been implemented by hhs pursuant to the medicare modernization act or that may be proposed or implemented in the future may have the effect of reducing the amount andor margins of medications purchased by physicians for administration in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers since the specialty group provides a number of services to or through physicians patient shifts from physicians to other healthcare providers may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the specialty group although the specialty group has contingency plans to enable it to retain and grow the business it conducts with and through physicians there can be no assurance that it will retain or replace all of the revenue currently going through the physician channel or that such revenue will be as profitable 

  

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 14939 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 reflects a decrease of 9 from 16487 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was 303 as compared to 343 in the prior fiscal year the decline in gross profit was primarily due to a decrease in the buyside component of the gross margin including a decline in inventory appreciation profits fewer alternate source and deal opportunities and the loss of the va business in fiscal 2004 contributing to the decline in inventory appreciation profits were lower levels of inventory onhand during the current fiscal year as a result of the business model transition and fewer than expected manufacturer price increases prior to the national election in november 2004 the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences during the fiscal years ended september 30 2005 and 2004 inventory balances declined which resulted in liquidation of lifo layers carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years the effects of the liquidations in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 were to decrease cost of goods sold by 306 million and 103 million respectively 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 9610 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 reflect an increase of 7 from 9001 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 were 195 as compared to 187 in the prior fiscal year the increases were primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense of 492 million which included a 155 million increase in bad debt relating to one of the operating companies within the specialty group and fiscal 2005 startup costs incurred in connection with the new distribution facilities which were primarily offset by continued productivity gains achieved throughout the company’s distribution network additionally prior year’s bad debt expense was favorably impacted by a 175 million recovery from a large former customer 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 5329 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 reflects a decrease of 29 from 7486 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was 108 as compared to 156 in the prior fiscal year the decline from the prioryear percentage was primarily due to a reduction in gross profit while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios this did not occur in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 and there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future or that expense ratio reductions if they should occur will offset possible declines in gross margins 

  

pharmerica segment results 

  

pharmerica operating revenue of 15714 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was flat compared to 15753 million in the prior fiscal year pharmerica’s operating revenue was impacted by competitive pressures that affected both the longterm care and workers’ compensation businesses and increasing reductions in medicaid reimbursement rates the future operating revenue growth rate will likely continue to be impacted by competitive pressures changes in the regulatory environment including the reimbursement changes that have been implemented pursuant to the medicare modernization act as well as the implementation of the voluntary prescription drug benefit program for seniors thereunder and the pharmaceutical inflation rate 

  

pharmerica gross profit of 4462 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 reflects a decrease of 7 from 4797 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was 2840 as compared to 3045 in the prior fiscal year the decline in gross profit was primarily due to industry competitive pressures and a reduction in the rates of reimbursement for the services provided by pharmerica which continue to adversely affect gross profit margins in both the workers’ compensation and longterm care businesses 

  

pharmerica operating expenses of 3543 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 decreased 1 from 3579 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses decreased slightly to 2254 in 

  

the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 from 2272 in the prior fiscal year pharmerica’s fiscal 2005 operating expenses were favorably impacted by aggressive cost reductions in response to the decline in operating revenue including the consolidation of local pharmacy administrative functions to regional centers for the longterm care business a reduction in bad debt expense of 55 million due to continued improvements made in credit and collection practices and continued improvements in operating practices of both the workers’ compensation and longterm care businesses the prior year’s operating expenses were favorably impacted by a 121 million reduction in sales and use tax liability due to favorable audit experience and other settlements 

  

pharmerica operating income of 919 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 decreased 25 from 1218 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2005 was 585 as compared to 774 in the prior fiscal year the decline was due to the aforementioned reduction in the gross profit margin while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins

consolidated results 

  

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 increased 7 to 488 billion from 455 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment offset slightly by a decline in operating revenue in the pharmerica segment 

  

the company’s customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company changed its accounting policy for customer sales returns to reflect an accrual for estimated customer returns at the time of sale to the customer previously the company accounted for customer sales returns as a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold at the time of the return as a result of this accounting policy change operating revenue and cost of goods sold were each reduced by 3168 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 

  

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 increased 5 to 43 billion from 41 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer the company is a principal to these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has general inventory risk physical loss inventory risk and customer credit risk as a result and in accordance with the emerging issues task force no 9919 “reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent” the company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross revenues due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

  

gross profit of 21664 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 decreased 3 from 22256 million in the prior fiscal year during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company recognized a 380 million gain from an antitrust litigation settlement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer this gain was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and contributed 2 of gross profit for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was 444 as compared to the prioryear percentage of 490 the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures offset in part by the antitrust litigation settlement 

  

dsada of 12580 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 reflects a decrease of 5 compared to 13306 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was 258 compared to 293 in the prior fiscal year the decline in the dsada percentage from the prior fiscal year 

  

reflects improvements in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to a a 563 million reduction of bad debt expense primarily due to a 175 million recovery from a former customer in the pharmaceutical distribution segment a 91 million recovery from a customer in the pharmerica segment and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments see further discussion below b a 121 million reduction in pharmerica’s sales and use tax liability c a reduction in employee headcount resulting from our integration efforts and d operational efficiencies primarily derived from our integration plan

amerisourcebergen corporation “amerisourcebergen” or the “company” is one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the company provides drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes more specifically we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals overthecounter healthcare products and home healthcare supplies and equipment to a wide variety of healthcare providers located throughout the united states including acute care hospitals and health systems independent and chain retail pharmacies mail order facilities physicians clinics and other alternate site facilities and skilled nursing and assisted living centers we also provide pharmaceuticals and pharmacy services to longterm care workers’ compensation and specialty drug patients additionally we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of services including pharmacy automation bedside medication safety systems pharmaceutical packaging inventory management reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services logistics services and physician education all of which are designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes 

  

industry overview 

  

we have benefited from the significant growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states according to ims healthcare inc an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales grew from approximately 73 billion in 1995 to an estimated 225 billion in 2004 and are expected to grow annually from 10 to 13 over the next three years 

  

the factors contributing to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other favorable industry trends include 

  

aging population  the number of individuals over age 55 in the united states grew from approximately 52 million in 1990 to approximately 59 million in 2000 and is projected to increase to more than 75 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from a greater incidence of chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene research and therapy continue to generate new compounds and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases these compounds have been responsible for significant increases in pharmaceutical sales we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry 

  

increased use of drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of costeffective drug therapies 

  

rising pharmaceutical prices  historically pharmaceutical price increases have equaled or exceeded the overall consumer price index we believe these increases were due in large part to the relatively inelastic demand notwithstanding higher prices charged for patented drugs as pharmaceutical manufacturers have attempted to recoup costs associated with the development clinical testing and us food and drug administration approval of new products recently pharmaceutical manufacturers have been under significant pressure to reduce the rate of pharmaceutical price increases during fiscal 2004 we experienced less pharmaceutical price increases than in the prior fiscal year while we expect pharmaceutical price increases to occur in the future we cannot predict the rate at which such prices will increase or the frequency of increases 

  

expiration of patents for brand name pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widelyused brand name pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years these products are expected to be marketed by generic 

  

pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributed by us we consider this a favorable trend because generic products have historically provided a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand name products 

  

the company 

  

we are one of the largest pharmaceutical services companies in the united states the company was formed by the merger of amerisource health corporation “amerisource” and bergen brunswig corporation “bergen” in august 2001 we currently serve our customers healthcare providers pharmaceutical manufacturers and patients throughout the united states and puerto rico through a geographically diverse network of distribution and service centers we typically are the primary source of supply for pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare providers and certain patients we offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel 

  

strategy 

  

our business strategy is focused solely on the pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide valueadded distribution and service solutions to healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase channel efficiencies and improve patient outcomes this disciplined focused strategy has significantly expanded our business and we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy 

  

   

we believe we have one of the lowest cost operating structures among our major national competitors and to further improve our position we launched our optimiz ™ program in fiscal 2001 as revised the optimiz ™ program consists of reducing the distribution facility network from a total of 51 facilities to less than 30 facilities in the next two to three years the plan includes building six new facilities two of them were operational as of september 30 2004 closing facilities seventeen of which have been closed and implementing a new warehouse operating system construction activities on the remaining four new facilities are ongoing two of them will be operational by the end of fiscal 2005 we anticipate closing six additional facilities in fiscal 2005 these measures have been designed to reduce operating costs to provide greater access to financing sources and to reduce our cost of capital in addition we believe we will continue to achieve productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse automation technology adopt “best practices” in warehousing activities and increase operating leverage by increasing volume per fullservice distribution facility 

  

   

we expect to continue to expand our manufacturer services which help pharmaceutical companies especially in the biotechnology sector commercialize their products in the channel we recently became the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies launch drugs with targeted populations and also support the products in the channel we are providing physician education services third party logistics and specialty pharmacy services to help speed products to market we also have pursued enhancements to our position through acquisitions including the following 

  

   

   

   

our provider solutions include our good neighbor pharmacy ® and family pharmacy ® programs which enable independent community pharmacies and small chain drugstores to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs bestpriced generic product purchasing services hospital pharmacy consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment patient safety software designed to reduce medication errors and packaging services that deliver unit dose punch card and other compliance packaging for institutional and retail pharmacy customers we also continue to pursue enhancements to our services and programs through acquisitions such as 

  

   

we believe these services will continue to expand further contributing to our revenue and income growth 

  

operations 

  

operating structure we operate in two segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

  

pharmaceutical distribution the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes the operations of amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” and the amerisourcebergen specialty packaging and technology groups servicing both pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel the pharmaceutical distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes throughout the united states and puerto rico the drug distribution operations of abdc and the amerisourcebergen specialty group comprised over 90 of the segment’s operating revenue and operating income in fiscal 2004 

  

abdc is our wholesale drug distribution business and is currently organized into five regions across the united states unlike our more centralized competitors we are structured as an organization of locally managed profit centers we believe the delivery of healthcare is local and therefore the management of each distribution facility has responsibility for its own customer service and financial performance these facilities utilize the company’s corporate staff for national and regional account management marketing data processing finance procurement human resources legal executive management resources and corporate coordination of asset and working capital management 

  

the amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services including group purchasing services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states including oncology nephrology and rheumatology absg also distributes vaccines other injectables and plasma in addition through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers third party logistics reimbursement consulting practice management and physician education 

  

the amerisourcebergen packaging group consists of american health packaging and anderson packaging “anderson” american health packaging delivers unit dose punch card unitofuse and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers anderson is a leading provider of contracted packaging services for pharmaceutical manufacturers 

  

the amerisourcebergen technology group “abtg” provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and medication and supply dispensing cabinets to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers abtg also provides barcodeenabled pointofcare software designed to reduce medication errors and supply management software for institutional and retail healthcare providers designed to improve efficiency 

  

pharmerica the pharmerica segment includes the operations of the pharmerica longterm care business “longterm care” and a workers’ compensationrelated business “workers’ compensation” 

  

pharmerica’s longterm care business is a leading national provider of pharmacy products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate site settings including skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and residential living communities pharmerica’s longterm care institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment and the distribution of those products to residents in longterm care and alternate site facilities unlike hospitals most longterm and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as pharmerica longterm care to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication pharmerica’s longterm care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patientspecific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition pharmerica’s long term care business provides infusion therapy services and medicare part b products as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services pharmerica’s longterm care network of 95 pharmacies covers a geographic area that includes over 80 of the nation’s institutionallongterm care beds each pharmerica longterm care pharmacy typically serves customers within a 100mile radius 

  

pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business provides mail order and online pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers’ compensation programs and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors workers’ compensation services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payor’s administrative costs 

  

sales and marketing abdc has sales professionals organized regionally and specialized by healthcare provider type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner our specialty packaging and technology groups and the pharmerica businesses each have an independent sales force that specializes in their respective product and service offerings our corporate marketing department designs and develops an array of amerisourcebergen valueadded healthcare provider solutions and marketing materials tailored to specific groups these programs and materials can be further customized at the distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions corporate sales and marketing also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and with the management of the specialty packaging and technology groups corporate sales and marketing ensures that our customers are receiving the mix of service offerings that most appropriately meet their needs 

  

customers we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm and alternate care facilities and physician offices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our customers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers during fiscal 2004 operating revenue for our pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of 59 institutional and 41 retail customers 

  

sales to the federal government including sales under separate contracts with different departments and agencies of the federal government and sales to medco health solutions inc “medco” each represented 6 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 in may 2004 the company discontinued servicing the united states department of veterans affairs “va” as a result of losing a competitive bid process the va contributed 5 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 in august 2004 the company discontinued servicing advancepcs because it was acquired by a customer of a competitor advancepcs contributed 4 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 other than the federal government and medco no individual customer accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2004 operating revenue including the federal government our top ten customers represented approximately 33 of operating revenue during fiscal 2004 revenues generated from sales to medco accounted for 97 of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and 13 of total revenues during fiscal 2004 in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 15 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships novation llc united drug stores and premier purchasing partners lp the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship would adversely affect future operating revenue 

  

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products primarily from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 9 of our purchases in fiscal 2004 the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally good the five largest suppliers in fiscal 2004 accounted for approximately 33 of purchases 

  

abdc is in a business model transition with respect to how manufacturers compensate us for our services historically suppliers helped us generate gross profit in several ways including cash discounts for prompt payments inventory buying opportunities rebates inventory management and other agreements vendor program arrangements negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities a significant portion of abdc’s gross margin has been derived from our ability to purchase merchandise inventories in advance of pharmaceutical price increases and then holding these inventories until pharmaceutical prices increase thereby generating a larger gross margin upon sale of the inventories over the last two years pharmaceutical manufacturers began to increase their control over the pharmaceutical supply channel by using product allocation methods including the imposition of inventory management agreements “imas” under most imas we are paid for not speculating with respect to pharmaceutical price increases however in many cases our compensation under imas continues to be predicated upon pharmaceutical price increases as of september 30 2004 approximately twothirds of our pharmaceutical distribution revenue is covered by imas additionally pharmaceutical manufacturers began restricting our ability to purchase their products from alternate sources and requested more product and distribution sales data from us we believe the changes that have been made provide pharmaceutical manufacturers with greater visibility over product demand and movement in the market and increased product safety and integrity by reducing the risks associated with product being available to the secondary market additionally in the quarter ended september 30 2004 we along with our competitors experienced a reduction in the number of pharmaceutical price increases as compared to our historical experience as pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing policies continue to be under intense scrutiny 

  

all of the above has led to significant volatility in abdc’s gross margin therefore we have commenced an effort to shift our pharmaceutical distribution model towards a feeforservice model where we are compensated for the services we provide manufacturers versus one that is dependent upon manufacturer price increases as is the case with the ima model we continue to work with our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners to define feeforservice terms that will adequately compensate us for our services as of september 30 2004 we have signed agreements that we consider feeforservice arrangements with a small number of our pharmaceutical manufacturer partners we believe the feeforservice model is a collaborative approach that will improve the efficiency of the supply channel and establish a more predictable earnings pattern for abdc while expanding our service relationship with pharmaceutical manufacturers however there can be no assurance that this business model transition will be successful we expect to continue discussion of feeforservice arrangements with the majority of pharmaceutical manufacturers in fiscal 2005 

  

management information systems abdc continually invests in advanced management information systems and automated warehouse technology abdc’s management information systems provide for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume abdc’s customized systems strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing product demand data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels 

  

abdc operates its fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities on two different centralized management information systems while continuing to migrate to one system and maintaining our customers’ access through either orderentry system 

  

abdc plans to continue to make system investments to further improve its information capabilities and meet its customer and operational needs abdc continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders invoices and payments electronically abdc is implementing a new warehouse operating system that is expected to improve its productivity and operating leverage as of september 30 2004 six of our distribution facilities have successfully implemented the new warehouse operating system 

  

absg operates its specialty distribution business on a common centralized erp platform resulting in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities the convenience of ordering via the internet is very important to absg’s customers over the last two years we have introduced and enhanced our web capabilities such that currently more than 30 of orders are initiated on the web 

  

pharmerica’s longterm care business operates a proprietary information technology infrastructure that automates order entry of medications dispensing of medications invoicing and payment processing these systems provide medical records consulting drug review and regulatory compliance information to help ensure patient safety pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business provides proprietary information technology for workers’ compensation solutions these systems provide eligibility authorization and reimbursement payments to participating pharmacies they also provide order taking shipment and collection of service fees for medications and specialty services the systems also provide billing and reimbursement for other services rendered pharmerica continues to invest in technologies that help improve data integrity critical information access and system availability 

  

competition 

  

we face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions we compete with both national and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution our national competitors include cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation in addition we compete with local distributors directselling manufacturers warehousing chain drugstores specialty distributors and packaging and healthcare technology companies the provider and alternate site product distribution channels serviced by absg are also highly competitive specialty distribution channel competitors include oncology therapeutics network fff enterprises henry schein medpath and priority healthcare corporation competitors in the business of providing specialty pharmaceutical services to manufacturers include us oncology inc covance inc and ups logistics among others competitive factors include price valueadded service programs product offerings service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

  

pharmerica’s competitors principally include national institutional pharmacies such as omnicare inc which is significantly larger than pharmerica and neighborcare inc as well as smaller regional pharmacies that specialize in longterm care we believe that the competitive factors most important in pharmerica’s lines of business are quality and range of service offered pricing reputation with referral sources ease of doing business with the provider and the ability to develop and maintain relationships with referral sources in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry in the local markets served by pharmerica and it may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants pharmerica also competes with numerous billing companies in connection with the portion of its business that electronically adjudicates workers’ compensation claims for payors 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a number of trademarks and service marks all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

  

we have developed or acquired various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

  

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and our medication and supply dispensing equipment we pursue patents for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate 

  

although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

  

employees 

  

as of september 30 2004 we employed approximately 14100 persons of which approximately 12800 were fulltime employees approximately 6 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 

  

government regulation 

  

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances wholesale distributors of these substances are required to register for permits meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the fda dea and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these regulations we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable wholesale distribution requirements 

  

we and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws which prohibit among other things a persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other government healthcare programs and b physicians from making referrals to certain entities with whom they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation the operations of pharmerica and the specialty group are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain aspects of our pharmaceutical distribution operations 

  

under the prospective payment system “pps” for medicare patients in skilled nursing facilities medicare pays a federal daily rate for virtually all covered skilled nursing facility services under pps pharmerica’s longterm care skilled nursing facility customers are not able to pass through to medicare their costs for certain products and services provided by pharmerica instead medicare provides such customers a federal daily rate to cover the costs of all covered goods and services provided to medicare patients which may include certain pharmaceutical and other goods and services provided by pharmerica because this medicare reimbursement is limited by pps facility customers have an increased incentive to negotiate with pharmerica to minimize the costs of providing goods and services to patients covered under medicare pharmerica continues to bill skilled nursing facilities on a negotiated fee schedule 

  

pharmerica’s longterm care business also receives reimbursement directly for dispensed pharmaceuticals in some cases under state medicaid programs over the last several years state medicaid programs have lowered reimbursement through a variety of mechanisms principally reductions in average wholesale price awp levels expansion of federal upper limit ful pricing and general reductions in contract payment methodology to pharmacies it is expected that such lower reimbursement levels and trends will continue through the introduction of the medicare part d drug benefit in 2006 

  

in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel but that may also restrict our ability to purchase drugs from alternate source suppliers and a small group of authorized distributors these laws and regulations will likely increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business 

  

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

the costs associated with complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

see “certain risk factors” below for discussion of additional regulatory developments that may affect the company’s results of operations and financial condition 

  

health information practices 

  

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the us department of health and human services set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of these standards we have implemented a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

  

certain risk factors 

  

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  

intense competition may erode our profit margins 

  

the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive we compete with national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals such as cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers who distribute their products directly to customers specialty distributors and other healthcare providers pharmerica’s longterm care and workers’ compensation businesses are also highly competitive 

  

competitive pressures have contributed to a decline in our gross profit margins on operating revenue from 544 in fiscal 2001 to 446 in fiscal 2004 this trend may continue and our business could be adversely affected as a result 

  

our operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

  

sales to the federal government including sales under separate contracts with different departments and agencies of the federal government and sales to medco each represented 6 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 in may 2004 the company discontinued servicing the united states department of veterans affairs “va” as a result of losing a competitive bid process the va contributed 5 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 in august 2004 the company discontinued servicing advancepcs because it was acquired by a customer of a competitor advancepcs contributed 4 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 other than the federal government and medco no individual customer accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2004 operating revenue including the federal government our top ten customers represented approximately 33 of operating revenue during fiscal 2004 revenues generated from sales to medco accounted for 97 of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and 13 of total revenues during fiscal 2004 in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of its members who are healthcare providers approximately 15 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2004 was derived from our three largest gpo relationships novation llc united drug stores and premier purchasing partners lp the loss of any major customer or gpo relationship could adversely affect future operating revenue and profitability 

  

our operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of a significant customer 

  

most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured the bankruptcy insolvency or other credit failure of any customer at a time when the customer has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations at september 30 2004 the largest trade receivable due from a single customer represented approximately 11 of accounts receivable net 

  

the company’s pharmaceutical distribution segment is transitioning its business model 

  

as previously discussed more fully under the heading “suppliers” within item 1 business the company’s pharmaceutical distribution segment which is the company’s largest business is in the midst of a business model transition with respect to how it is compensated for services it provides to pharmaceutical manufacturers there can be no assurance that the pharmaceutical distribution business will ultimately succeed in transitioning its business model or if such transition is successful that the timing of that transition will occur as anticipated by the company if the transition does not succeed the company may not be adequately compensated and its profitability may be significantly reduced 

  

increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control the pharmaceutical supply channel may reduce our profitability 

  

we generally seek to maintain product inventories at levels that are sufficient to fulfill our service level commitments under distribution contracts with healthcare providers historically we have been able to lower our overall cost of goods and 

  

increase our profit margins by purchasing surplus inventory from pharmaceutical manufacturers in advance of anticipated price increases and by purchasing surplus inventory from alternate source suppliers who are licensed suppliers of pharmaceuticals at prices lower than those available to us directly from the manufacturers pharmaceutical manufacturers have become aggressive in undertaking efforts to reduce our ability to lower our overall costs of goods below their product pricing levels we have encountered increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control the supply channel such efforts have had the effect of reducing our profitability many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts that cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such changes in our relationships with manufacturers accordingly the advent of such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts through the end of the applicable contract periods we intend to seek rights in future contracts to adjust pricing and other terms if adverse supply chain developments or other adverse changes affecting our profitability structure for distribution services should arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such contractual rights or that such rights will be adequate to offset the effect of any such adverse developments or changes 

  

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may reduce our profitability 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local state and federal level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various local state and federal laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies historically we have been able to lower our overall cost of goods and increase our profit margins by purchasing surplus inventory from alternate source suppliers who are licensed suppliers of pharmaceuticals at prices lower than those available to us directly from the manufacturers in recent years some states have passed or have proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel but that also may restrict our ability to purchase drugs from alternate source suppliers and a small group of authorized distributors laws and regulations that have the effect of restricting our ability to engage in alternate source purchasing also may reduce our profitability we have announced our support of possible fda regulations that would limit the pharmaceutical supply channel to manufacturers and a limited group of distributors which would include us and our national competitors among others and would diminish greatly if not eliminate any opportunities for us to increase our income through alternate source purchasing 

  

legal and regulatory changes affecting rates of reimbursement for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services may reduce our profitability 

  

both our own profit margins and the profit margins of our customers may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals andor medical treatments or services or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined many of our contracts with healthcare providers are multiyear contracts that cannot be terminated or amended in the event of such legal and regulatory changes accordingly such changes may have the effect of reducing or even eliminating our profitability on such contracts until the end of the applicable contract periods we intend to seek rights in future contracts to adjust pricing and other terms if adverse legal and regulatory developments should arise there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such contractual rights or that such rights will be adequate to offset the effect of any adverse developments or changes 

  

as early as january 2005 the specialty group’s business may be adversely impacted by proposed changes in the medicare reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs the reimbursement changes recently proposed by the us department of health and human services pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare modernization act” or that may be proposed in the future may have the effect of reducing the amount of medications administered by physicians in their offices and may force patients to other healthcare providers this may result in lower revenues for the specialty group although the specialty group is preparing contingency plans to enable it to retain its distribution volume there can be no assurance that it will retain all of the distribution volume currently going through the physician channel 

  

the medicare modernization act includes a major expansion of the medicare prescription drug benefit under new medicare part d beginning in 2006 medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs medicare beneficiaries who are also entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program socalled “dual eligibles” will have their prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit these dual eligibles would include those nursing home residents served by the pharmerica longterm care business whose drug costs are currently covered by state medicaid programs proposed regulations to implement the new medicare drug benefit would permit longterm care pharmacies to provide covered medicare part d drugs to enrollees of the new medicare part d plans under the proposed regulations longterm care pharmacies could participate on an innetwork basis by contracting directly with the plan sponsor or on an outofnetwork basis given the potential for significant revisions based on comments received we cannot determine the effect of medicare part d on the pharmerica longterm care business until the regulations are finalized but 

  

the implementation of medicare part d could have an adverse effect on the pharmerica longterm care business in addition the secretary of the department of health and human services is required to conduct a study of current standards of practice for pharmacy services provided to patients in longterm care settings and among other things make recommendations regarding necessary actions and appropriate reimbursement to ensure the provision of prescription drugs to medicare beneficiaries in nursing facilities consistent with existing patient safety and quality of care standards such recommendations and actions could have an adverse effect on the pharmerica longterm care business 

  

the changing united states healthcare environment may negatively impact our revenue and income 

  

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services 

  

changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our income see the discussion of pharmaceutical pricing under the heading “industry overview” within item 1 business 

  

medicare part d under the medicare modernization act will give medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit in 2006 and give beneficiaries drug discounts prior to 2006 although all of the implementation details of this legislation are not finalized at this time this legislation eventually could have an adverse effect on our revenue and income 

  

if we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

  

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting the medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i prohibit persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of enhancing our distribution network 

  

through our optimiz ™ program as revised we will consolidate our distribution facilities from 51 to less than 30 and implement new warehouse information technology systems the program is designed to focus capacity on growing markets significantly increase warehouse efficiencies and streamline our transportation activities our plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of less than 30 facilities within the next two to three years the plan includes building six new facilities two of which are operational as of september 30 2004 closing facilities seventeen of which have been closed and implementing a new warehouse operating system construction activities on the remaining four new facilities are ongoing two of them will be operational by the end of fiscal 2005 we anticipate closing six additional facilities in fiscal 2005 we believe our enhanced distribution network will result in the lowest costs in pharmaceutical distribution and the highest accuracy and speed of customer order fulfillment we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of enhancing our distribution network if we experience delays in building the new facilities or closing existing facilities we incur significant cost overruns associated with the program or the new warehouse information technology systems do not function as planned 

  

our operating results andor financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate 

  

we expect to continue to implement our growth strategy in part by acquiring companies at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions not all of which will be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

  

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term the assumption of unknown liabilities the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions 

  

we anticipate that we may finance acquisitions in the foreseeable future at least partly by the issuance of additional common stock the use of equity financing for acquisitions would dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders 

  

if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls we may not be able to accurately report our financial results and our management may not be able to provide its report on the effectiveness of our internal controls in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2005 as required pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or provide the unqualified attestation or any attestation from our independent auditor on management’s assessment of our internal controls 

  

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act our management will be required to deliver a report in our annual report on form 10k for the fiscal year ending september 30 2005 that assesses the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting we also will be required to deliver an attestation report of our independent auditors on our management’s assessment of and operating effectiveness of internal controls we have undertaken substantial effort to assess enhance and document our internal control systems financial processes and information systems and expect to continue to do so during fiscal 2005 in preparation for the required evaluation process significant use of resources both internal and external will be required to make the requisite evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls while the company believes it has adequate internal controls and will meet its obligations there can be no assurance that the company will be able to complete the work necessary for the company’s management to issue its report in a timely manner or that management or the company’s independent auditor will conclude that the company’s internal controls are effective 

  

risks generally associated with the company’s sophisticated information systems may adversely affect the company’s operating results 

  

the company relies on sophisticated information systems in its business to obtain rapidly process analyze and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers receive process and ship orders on a timely basis to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers and to process payments to suppliers net of deductions the company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time including due to the actions of third parties

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tableend   

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 

  

the company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers and substantially all of its operations are located in the united states the company’s operations are comprised of two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

  

pharmaceutical distribution

abdc is our wholesale drug distribution business and is currently organized into five regions across the united states unlike our more centralized competitors we are structured as an organization of locally managed profit centers we believe the delivery of healthcare is local and therefore the management of each distribution facility has responsibility for its own customer service and financial performance these facilities utilize the company’s corporate staff for national and regional account management marketing data processing finance procurement human resources legal executive management resources and corporate coordination of asset and working capital management 

  

the amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” or the “specialty group” through a number of individual operating businesses provides distribution and other services including group purchasing services to physicians and alternate care providers who specialize in a variety of disease states including oncology nephrology and rheumatology absg also distributes vaccines other injectables and plasma in addition through its manufacturer services and physician and patient services businesses absg provides a number of commercialization and other services for biotech and other pharmaceutical manufacturers third party logistics reimbursement consulting practice management and physician education

the amerisourcebergen technology group “abtg” provides scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment and medication and supply dispensing cabinets to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers abtg also provides barcodeenabled pointofcare software designed to reduce medication errors and supply management software for institutional and retail healthcare providers designed to improve efficiency 

  

pharmerica 

  

the pharmerica segment includes the operations of the pharmerica longterm care business “longterm care” and a workers’ compensationrelated business “workers’ compensation” 

  

pharmerica’s longterm care business is a leading national provider of pharmacy products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate site settings including skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and residential living communities pharmerica’s longterm care institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment and the distribution of those products to residents in longterm care and alternate site facilities unlike hospitals most longterm and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as pharmerica longterm care to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication pharmerica’s longterm care pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patientspecific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition pharmerica’s longterm care business provides infusion therapy services and medicare part b products as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services

amerisourcebergen corporation 

summary segment information 

  

   

year ended september 30 2004 compared with year ended september 30 2003 

  

consolidated results 

  

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 increased 7 to 489 billion from 455 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment offset slightly by a decline in operating revenue in the pharmerica segment 

  

the company’s customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company changed its accounting policy for customer sales returns to reflect an accrual for estimated customer returns at the time of sale to the customer previously the company accounted for customer sales returns as a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold at the time of the return as a result of this accounting policy change operating revenue and cost of goods sold were each reduced by 3168 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 

  

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the company at the express direction of the customer and involve either shipments from the supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites or shipments from the supplier to the company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 increased 5 to 43 billion from 41 billion in the prior fiscal year due to an increase in demand from the company’s largest bulk customer due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has a positive impact on the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and payments by the company to its suppliers 

  

gross profit of 21792 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 decreased 3 from 22472 million in the prior fiscal year during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company recognized a 380 million gain from an antitrust litigation settlement with a pharmaceutical manufacturer this gain was recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold and contributed 2 of gross profit for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was 446 as compared to the prioryear percentage of 493 the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to a decline in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures offset in part by the antitrust litigation settlement 

  

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 12812 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 reflects a decrease of 5 compared to 13551 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was 262 compared to 298 in the prior fiscal year the decline in the dsada percentage from the prior fiscal year reflects improvements in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to a a 563 million reduction of bad debt expense primarily due to a 175 million recovery from a former customer in the pharmaceutical distribution segment a 91 million recovery from a customer in the pharmerica segment and the continued improvements made in the credit and collection practices in both segments b a 121 million reduction in pharmerica’s sales and use tax liability c a reduction in employee headcount resulting from our integration efforts and d operational efficiencies primarily derived from our integration plans 

  

in 2001 the company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicative administrative functions as of september 30 2004 these plans have resulted in synergies of approximately 150 million on an annual basis the company’s plan as revised is to have a distribution facility network consisting of less than 30 facilities in the next two to three years the plan includes building six new facilities two of which are operational as of september 30 2004 and closing facilities seventeen of which have been closed construction activities on the remaining four new facilities are ongoing two of which will be operational by the end of fiscal 2005 during fiscal 2004 and 2003 the company closed four and six distribution facilities respectively the company anticipates closing six additional facilities in fiscal 2005 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 the company announced integration initiatives relating to the closure of a repackaging facility and the elimination of certain administrative functions including the closure of a related office facility the cost of these initiatives of approximately 192 million which included 158 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated 16 million for lease cancellation costs and 18 million for the writedown of assets related to the facilities to be closed resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002 at september 30 2004 all of the employees had been terminated 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 the company closed six distribution facilities and eliminated certain administrative and operational functions “the fiscal 2003 initiatives” during the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 the company recorded 09 million and 103 million respectively of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives through september 30 2004 approximately 780 employees received termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives of which substantially all have been terminated during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 severance accruals of 18 million recorded in september 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the company or were retained in other positions within the company 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company closed four distribution facilities and eliminated duplicative administrative functions “the fiscal 2004 initiatives” during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the company recorded 54 million of employee severance costs in connection with the termination of 230 employees relating to the fiscal 2004 initiatives as of september 30 2004 approximately 190 employees had been terminated additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced 

  

the company paid a total of 95 million and 138 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs in the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively related to the aforementioned integration plans remaining unpaid amounts of 31 million for employee severance and lease cancellation costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2004 most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not to exceed 12 months while others may receive a lumpsum payment 

  

operating income of 8904 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was relatively flat compared to 8831 million in the prior fiscal year the gain on litigation settlement less costs of facility consolidations and employee severance increased the company’s operating income by 305 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 and costs of facility consolidations and employee severance reduced the company’s operating income by 89 million in the prior fiscal year the company’s operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 182 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 compared to 194 in the prior fiscal year the gain on litigation settlement contributed approximately 8 basis points to the company’s operating income as a percentage of operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 the contribution provided by the litigation settlement was offset by a decrease in gross margin in excess of the aforementioned dsada expense percentage reduction 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 a technology company in which the company had an equity investment sold substantially all of its assets and paid a liquidating dividend as a result the company recorded a gain of 84 million in other income during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 the company recorded losses of 80 million which primarily consisted of a 55 million charge related to the decline in fair value of its equity investment in the technology company because the decline was judged to be otherthantemporary

segment information 

  

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of 482 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 reflects an increase of 8 from 447 billion in the prior fiscal year the company’s change in accounting for customer sales returns had the effect of reducing operating revenue growth by 1 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 59 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 41 was from sales to retail customers this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 57 institutional and 43 retail 

  

in comparison with prioryear results sales to institutional customers increased 12 in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the above market rate growth of the specialty pharmaceutical business and higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals which was offset in part by the discontinuance of servicing the united states department of veterans affairs “va” during the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 as a result of losing a competitive bid process the va contract was terminated in may 2004 and contributed 48 and 78 of the segment’s operating revenue in the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively in march 2004 caremark rx inc acquired advance pcs one of the company’s largest customers as a result the company’s contract with advance pcs was terminated in august 2004 advance pcs accounted for approximately 44 and 48 of the segment’s operating revenue in the fiscal years ended september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

sales to retail customers increased 2 over the prior fiscal year the independent retail sector experienced strong doubledigit sales growth while sales in the chain retail sector decreased by 6 due to sales declines experienced by certain large regional retail chain customers additionally retail sales in the firsthalf of fiscal 2004 were adversely impacted by the prior fiscal year loss of a large customer 

  

this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lowerpriced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry growth rates as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc are expected to be from 10 to 13 over the next three years future operating revenue growth will continue to be driven by industry growth trends competition within the industry customer consolidation changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing policies and potential changes in federal government rules and regulations the company’s specialty group has been growing at rates significantly in excess of overall pharmaceutical market growth the majority of this group’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states such as oncology nephrology and rheumatology additionally the specialty group distributes vaccines and blood plasma the specialty group’s oncology business has continued to outperform the market and continues to be the specialty group’s most significant contributor to revenue growth as early as january 2005 the specialty group’s business may be adversely impacted by proposed changes in the reimbursement rates for certain pharmaceuticals including oncology drugs the reimbursement changes recently proposed by the us department of health and human services pursuant to the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003 “medicare modernization act” or that may be proposed in the future may have the effect of reducing the amount of medications administered by physicians in their offices which may force patients to other healthcare providers this may result in slower or reduced growth in revenues for the specialty group although the specialty group is preparing contingency plans to enable it to retain its distribution volume there can be no assurance that the specialty group will retain all of the distribution volume currently going through the physician channel 

  

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 16615 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 reflects a decrease of 3 from 17215 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was 345 as compared to 385 in the prior fiscal year the decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the result of a reduction in profits related to pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases the va contract loss the continuing competitive environment which has led to a number of contract renewals with reduced profitability and the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional mail order and chain accounts downward pressures on sellside gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buyside component of the gross margin including increases derived from manufacturer price increases negotiated deals and alternate source market opportunities will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline of the sellside margin the company expects that buyside purchasing opportunities will continue to decrease in the future as pharmaceutical manufacturers increasingly seek to control the supply channel through product allocations that limit the inventory the company can purchase and through the imposition of inventory management and other agreements that prohibit or restrict the company’s right to purchase inventory from alternate source suppliers although the company seeks in any such agreements to obtain appropriate compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for foregoing buyside purchasing opportunities there can be no assurance that the agreements will function as intended and replace any or all lost profit opportunities in addition a significant amount of the company’s payments under current pharmaceutical manufacturer agreements are triggered by pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases these may lead to significant earnings volatility although the company is negotiating with pharmaceutical manufacturers to change the payment trigger and lessen its dependence on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in transforming its relationships to a feeforservice structure from their current structure the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 7381 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 reflects a decrease of 6 from 7882 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 was 153 as compared to 176 in the prior fiscal year the decline over the prioryear percentage was due to a reduction in gross margins in excess of the declines in the operating expense ratios while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future or that expense ratio reductions will offset possible declines in gross margins 

  

pharmerica segment 

  

pharmerica operating revenue of 15753 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2004 reflects a decrease of 2 from 16082 million in the prior fiscal year pharmerica’s decline in operating revenue is primarily due to the loss of two significant customers in the workers’ compensation business the discontinuance of the sale of healthcare products within the longterm care business and the loss of a longterm care business customer because it was acquired by a customer of a competitor the future operating revenue growth rate may be impacted by competitive pressures changes in the regulatory environment including reimbursement changes arising from the medicare modernization act and the pharmaceutical inflation rate

consolidated results 

  

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 increased 13 to 455 billion from 402 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 decreased 17 to 41 billion from 50 billion in the prior fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to the company’s conversion of a portion of its bulk and other direct business with its primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the company’s various warehouses due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries had a positive impact to the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and the payments by the company to its suppliers 

  

gross profit of 22472 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflected an increase of 11 from 20245 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was 493 as compared to the prioryear percentage of 503 the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflected declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments primarily due to changes in customer mix and competitive pressures offset in part by the positive aggregate margin impact resulting from the company’s recent acquisitions

pharmerica segment 

  

pharmerica operating revenue increased 9 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 to 16082 million compared to 14750 million in the prior fiscal year this increase was principally attributable to growth in pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business which grew at a faster rate than its longterm care business during the second half of fiscal 2003 the growth rate of the workers’ compensation business began to slow down partially due to the loss of a significant customer

merchandise inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 92 and 94 of the company’s inventories at september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively are determined using the lastin firstout “lifo” method if the company had used the firstin firstout “fifo” method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 1661 million and 1694 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2004 and 2003 respectively 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

the company accounts for purchased goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” under sfas no 142 purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer relationships noncompete agreements and software technology will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 

  

in order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives under sfas no 142 a determination of the fair value of the company’s reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses annually changes in market conditions among other factors may have an impact on these estimates the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2004 and 2003 and determined that there was no impairment

liquidity and capital resources 

  

the following table illustrates the company’s debt structure at september 30 2004 including availability under revolving credit facilities and the receivables securitization facility in thousands 

  

   

prior to fiscal 2004 the company’s working capital usage fluctuated significantly during the fiscal year due to seasonal inventory buying requirements and buyside purchasing opportunities in light of the recent increase in the number of inventory management agreements with suppliers the company’s working capital did not significantly fluctuate in fiscal 2004 the company’s 21 billion of aggregate availability under its revolving credit facility and its receivables securitization facility provide sufficient sources of capital to fund its inventory buying requirements

industry overview 

  

we have benefited from the significant growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states according to ims healthcare inc an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales grew from approximately 73 billion in 1995 to an estimated 203 billion in 2003 and are expected to grow to at least 250 billion in 2005 

  

the factors contributing to the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the united states and other favorable industry trends include 

  

aging population  the number of individuals over age 55 in the united states grew from approximately 52 million in 1990 to approximately 59 million in 2000 and is projected to increase to more than 75 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from a greater incidence of chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states 

  

introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene research and therapy continue to generate new compounds and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases these compounds have been responsible for significant increases in pharmaceutical sales we believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry 

  

increased use of outpatient drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 10 of overall healthcare costs pharmaceutical manufacturers’ emphasis on research and development is expected to continue the introduction of costeffective drug therapies 

  

rising pharmaceutical prices  consistent with historical trends we believe pharmaceutical price increases will continue to equal or exceed the overall consumer price index we believe these increases will be due in large part to the relatively inelastic demand in the face of higher prices charged for patented drugs as pharmaceutical manufacturers have attempted to recoup costs associated with the development clinical testing and us food and drug administration “fda” approval of new products 

  

expiration of patents for brand name pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widelyused brand name pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years these products are expected to be marketed by generic pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributed by us we consider this a favorable trend because generic products have historically provided a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand name products 

  

the company 

  

amerisourcebergen was formed in connection with the merger of amerisource health corporation “amerisource” and bergen brunswig corporation “bergen” which was consummated in august 2001 the “merger” as a result of the merger we are the largest pharmaceutical services company in the united states that is dedicated solely to the pharmaceutical supply channel 

  

we currently serve our customers primarily healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as patients throughout the united states and puerto rico through a geographically diverse network of distribution and service centers we typically are the primary source of supply for pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare providers and certain patients we offer a broad range of solutions to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel 

  

strategy 

  

our business strategy is anchored in national pharmaceutical distribution and services reinforced by the valueadded healthcare solutions we provide healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers this focused strategy has significantly expanded our businesses and we believe we are wellpositioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy 

  

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

   

operations 

  

operating structure we operate in two segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica 

  

pharmaceutical distribution the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes amerisourcebergen drug corporation “abdc” and amerisourcebergen specialty group “absg” abdc includes our fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution and other healthcare related businesses throughout the united states and puerto rico abdc sells pharmaceuticals overthecounter medicines health and beauty aids and other healthrelated products to hospitals alternate care and mail order facilities and independent and chain retail pharmacies abdc also provides a variety of products and services to its customers and pharmaceutical and other healthcare product manufacturers including promotional packaging inventory management pharmacy automation bedside medication safety software and information services these products and services are provided by abdc directly and through its subsidiaries and affiliates including american health packaging anderson packaging automed technologies bridge medical and pharmacy healthcare solutions absg sells specialty pharmaceutical products and services to physicians clinics patients and other providers primarily in the oncology nephrology plasma and vaccines sectors absg also provides third party logistics reimbursement consulting services physician education consulting and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers 

  

our wholesale drug distribution business is currently organized into five regions across the united states unlike our more centralized competitors we are structured as an organization of locally managed profit centers we believe that the delivery of healthcare is local and therefore the management of each distribution facility has responsibility for its own customer service and financial performance these facilities utilize the company’s corporate staff for nationalregional account management marketing data processing financial procurement human resources legal and executive management resources and corporate coordination of asset and working capital management 

  

pharmerica pharmerica is a leading national provider of institutional pharmacy products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate care settings including skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and residential living communities pharmerica also provides mail order and online pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers’ compensation programs and provides pharmaceutical claims administration services for payors 

  

pharmerica’s institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from our pharmaceutical distribution segment and the distribution of those products to residents in longterm care and alternate care facilities unlike hospitals most longterm and alternate care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as pharmerica to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication pharmerica’s pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patientspecific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition pharmerica provides infusion therapy services and medicare part b products as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services 

  

pharmerica’s network of 125 pharmacies which includes pharmacies at customer sites covers a geographic area that includes over 90 of the nation’s institutionallongterm care beds each pharmerica pharmacy typically serves customers within a 100mile radius pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business provides pharmaceutical claims administration and mail order distribution pharmerica’s services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payor’s administrative costs 

  

sales and marketing our wholesale drug distribution business has approximately 360 sales professionals organized regionally and specialized by customer type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner our corporate marketing department designs and develops an array of amerisourcebergen valueadded healthcare provider solutions tailored to specific groups these programs can be further customized at the distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions corporate sales and marketing also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers additionally absg pharmerica and substantially all of the other amerisourcebergen companies each has an independent sales force that specializes in its respective product and service offerings 

  

facilities each of our distribution facilities carries an inventory suited to the needs of the local market the efficient distribution of small orders is possible through the extensive use of automation and modern warehouse techniques these include computerized warehouse product location routing and inventory replenishment systems gravityflow racking mechanized order selection and efficient truck loading and routing we typically deliver our products on a daily basis mainly by using contract carriers night product picking operations in our distribution facilities have further reduced delivery time orders are generally delivered in less than 24 hours 

  

the following table presents certain information regarding our fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution centers for fiscal years 2003 and 2002 and amerisource and bergen pharmaceutical distribution centers on a pro forma combined basis for fiscal years 1999 through 2001 

  

   

customers and markets we have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals health systems mail order pharmacies longterm and alternate care facilities and physician offices retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our customers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers allowing them to 

  

improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers during fiscal 2003 operating revenue for our pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of a sales mix of 56 institutional and 44 retail 

  

sales to the federal government including sales under separate contracts with different departments and agencies of the federal government represented 9 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2003 in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which represents multiple healthcare providers loss of a major federal government customer or a gpo relationship could lead to a significant reduction in revenue as could the loss of one or more of our significant individual customers however other than the federal government we have no individual customer that accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2003 operating revenue including the federal government our top ten customers represented approximately 36 of operating revenue during fiscal 2003 revenues generated from sales to medco health solutions inc accounted for 98 of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses and 12 of total revenues during fiscal 2003 

  

suppliers we obtain pharmaceutical and other products primarily from manufacturers none of which accounted for more than approximately 9 of our purchases in fiscal 2003 the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are generally good the five largest suppliers in fiscal 2003 accounted for approximately 36 of purchases we seek to maintain our product inventories at levels that are sufficient to fulfill our service level commitments under our distribution contracts with customers product allocations by manufacturers or other efforts by manufacturers including the imposition of inventory management agreements may affect our ability to fulfill our customer commitments we generally have not experienced difficulty in purchasing desired products from our suppliers in the past however we expect to face increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control the pharmaceutical supply channel see certain risk factors below our business could be adversely affected by such efforts supplier relationships help us to generate gross profit in several ways including cash discounts for prompt payments inventory buying opportunities rebates vendor program arrangements negotiated deals and other promotional opportunities in the future suppliers may not continue to offer such programs or opportunities in the same form or at the current levels 

  

management information systems we continually invest in advanced management information systems and automated warehouse technology our management information systems provide for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume our customized systems strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels 

  

we operate our fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution facilities on two different centralized management information systems one is the former amerisource system and the other is the former bergen system we continue to integrate the systems while maintaining our customers’ access through either orderentry system 

  

we plan to continue to make system investments to further improve our information capabilities and meet our customer and operational needs we continue to expand our electronic interface with our suppliers and currently process a substantial portion of our purchase orders invoices and payments electronically we are implementing a new warehouse operating system which is expected to improve our productivity and operating leverage during fiscal 2003 three of our distribution facilities have successfully implemented the new warehouse operating system 

  

competition 

  

we face a highly competitive environment in the wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions we compete with both national and regional distributors our national competitors include cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation in addition we compete with local distributors directselling manufacturers warehousing chain drugstores and other specialty distributors competitive factors include price valueadded service programs product offerings service and delivery credit terms and customer support 

  

pharmerica’s competitors principally include national institutional pharmacies such as omnicare neighborcare and kindred healthcare as well as smaller regional pharmacies that specialize in longterm care we believe that the competitive factors most important in pharmerica’s lines of business are quality and range of service offered pricing reputation with referral sources ease of doing business with the provider and the ability to develop and maintain relationships with referral sources one of pharmerica’s national competitors is significantly larger than pharmerica in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry in the local markets served by pharmerica and it may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants pharmerica 

  

competes with numerous billing companies in connection with the portion of its business that electronically adjudicates workers’ compensation claims for payors 

  

intellectual property 

  

we use a number of trademarks and service marks in the course of our business all of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the united states or are the subject of pending applications for registration 

  

we have developed various proprietary products processes software and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers we generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret patent and copyright laws and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections 

  

we hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products and services particularly in the area of automated dispensing of pharmaceuticals we pursue patents for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate although we believe that our patents do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time 

  

employees 

  

as of september 30 2003 we employed approximately 14800 persons of which approximately 13600 were fulltime employees approximately 6 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good 

  

government regulation 

  

the us drug enforcement administration “dea” the us food and drug administration “fda” and various state boards of pharmacy regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances requiring wholesale distributors of these substances to register for permits meet various security and operating standards and comply with regulations governing their sale marketing packaging holding and distribution the fda dea and state pharmacy boards have broad enforcement powers including their ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products we are subject to these regulations we have received all necessary regulatory approvals and believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable wholesale distribution requirements 

  

we andor our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws which preclude among other things a persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare or medicaid and b physicians from making referrals to certain entities with which they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation the operations of pharmerica and absg are particularly subject to these laws and regulations as are certain other aspects of our pharmaceutical distribution operations 

  

under the prospective payment system “pps” for medicare patients in skilled nursing facilities pps pays a federal daily rate for virtually all covered skilled nursing facility services under pps pharmerica’s skilled nursing facility customers are not able to pass through to medicare their costs for certain products and services provided by pharmerica instead pps provides pharmerica’s customers a federal daily rate to cover the costs of all eligible goods and services provided to medicare patients which may include certain pharmaceutical and other goods and services provided by pharmerica since the amount of skilled nursing facility medicare reimbursement is limited by pps facility customers have an increased incentive to negotiate with pharmerica to minimize the costs of providing goods and services to patients covered under medicare pharmerica continues to bill skilled nursing facilities on a negotiated fee schedule 

  

pharmerica’s reimbursements for pharmaceuticals provided under state medicaid programs are also subject to government regulations over the last three years state medicaid programs have lowered reimbursement through a variety of mechanisms principally reductions in average wholesale price awp levels expansion of federal upper limit ful pricing 

  

and general reductions in contract payment methodology to pharmacies it is expected that such lower reimbursement will continue into future years 

  

recently publicized incidents in which counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled pharmaceutical drugs have passed through the pharmaceutical supply channel have given rise to the proposal in a number of states and the adoption in some states including florida of laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel these laws and regulations will likely increase the overall regulatory burden and costs associated with our pharmaceutical distribution business 

  

in november 2003 federal legislation was enacted that is intended to give medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit in 2006 and some form of drug discounts prior to 2006 we cannot predict at this time how the eventual implementation of this legislation will affect the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry or our pharmaceutical distribution business 

  

as a result of political economic and regulatory influences the healthcare delivery industry in the united states is under intensive scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes we cannot predict which reform proposals will be adopted when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 

  

health information practices 

  

the health information portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the us department of health and human services set forth health information standards in order to protect security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of these standards we have implemented a hipaa compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply with the hipaa regulations 

  

certain risk factors 

  

the following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects these risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report 

  

intense competition may erode our profit margins 

  

the wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services is highly competitive we compete primarily with the following national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals such as cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals chain drugstores that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals manufacturers who distribute their products directly to customers and other specialty distributors 

  

competitive pressures have contributed to a decline in our pharmaceutical distribution segment gross profit margins on operating revenue from 47 on a combined basis in fiscal 1997 to 39 in fiscal 2003 this trend may continue and our business could be adversely affected as a result 

  

the changing united states healthcare environment may impact our revenue and income 

  

our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the united states in recent years the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending these changes include an increased reliance on managed care cuts in medicare funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base consolidation of competitors suppliers and customers and the development of large sophisticated purchasing groups we expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future some of these potential changes such as a reduction in governmental support of healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing healthcare services or mandated benefits may cause healthcare industry participants to greatly reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our income federal legislation was recently enacted giving medicare beneficiaries a prescription drug benefit in 2006 and drug discounts prior to 2006 although the implementation details of this legislation are not known at this time this legislation eventually could have an adverse effect on our revenue and income 

  

we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of enhancing our distribution network 

  

as a result of the merger we implemented our optimiz program through which we will consolidate our distribution facilities from 51 to 30 and implement new warehouse information technology systems the program is designed to focus capacity on growing markets significantly increase warehouse efficiencies and streamline our transportation activities our plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities within the next three to four years this will be accomplished by building six new facilities expanding seven facilities and closing 27 facilities during fiscal 2003 the company began construction activities on three of its new facilities in addition two of the seven facility expansions were completed in fiscal 2003 during fiscal 2003 and 2002 the company closed six and seven distribution facilities respectively the company anticipates closing three additional facilities in fiscal 2004 we believe our enhanced distribution network will result in the lowest costs in pharmaceutical distribution and the highest accuracy and speed of customer order fulfillment we may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of enhancing our distribution network if we experience delays in building the new facilities experience delays in expanding facilities experience delays in facility closings or incur significant cost overruns associated with the program or if the new warehouse information technology systems do not function as planned 

  

increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control the pharmaceutical supply channel may reduce our profitability 

  

we generally seek to maintain product inventories at levels that are sufficient to fulfill our service level commitments under distribution contracts with customers however we have been able to lower our overall cost of goods and increase our profit margins by purchasing surplus inventory from pharmaceutical manufacturers in advance of anticipated price increases and by purchasing surplus inventory from secondary source suppliers which are licensed suppliers of pharmaceuticals other than the manufacturers at prices lower than those available to us directly from the manufacturers pharmaceutical manufacturers have become aggressive in undertaking efforts to reduce our ability to lower our overall costs of goods below the pricing levels established for us by the manufacturers we have encountered increasing efforts by pharmaceutical manufacturers to control the supply channel such efforts if accepted by us or if otherwise successful may have the effect of reducing our profitability 

  

increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may reduce our profitability 

  

the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local state and federal level consequently we are subject to the risk of changes in various local state and federal laws which include operating and security standards of the dea the fda various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies recently publicized incidents in which counterfeit adulterated andor mislabeled drugs have passed through the pharmaceutical supply channel have given rise to the proposal in a number of states and the adoption in some states including florida of laws and regulations that are intended to protect the integrity of the supply channel but that also may restrict our ability to purchase drugs from sources other than pharmaceutical manufacturers and a very limited group of authorized distributors 

  

we have been able to lower our overall cost of goods and increase our profit margins by purchasing surplus inventory from secondary source suppliers which are licensed suppliers of pharmaceuticals other than the manufacturers at prices lower than those available to us directly from the manufacturers laws and regulations that have the effect of restricting our ability to engage in secondary source purchasing also may have the effect of reducing our profitability we have announced our support of possible fda regulations that effectively would limit the pharmaceutical supply channel to manufacturers and a limited group of distributors which would include us and our national competitors among others and would diminish greatly if not eliminate any opportunities for us to increase our income through secondary source purchasing 

  

our operating revenue and profitability may suffer upon the loss of a significant customer 

  

sales to the federal government including sales under separate contracts with different departments and agencies of the federal government represented 9 of our operating revenue in fiscal 2003 sales under our distribution agreement with the united states department of veterans affairs the “va” represented approximately 80 of federal government sales during fiscal 2003 in addition we have contracts with group purchasing organizations “gpos” each of which represents multiple healthcare providers other than the federal government we have no individual customer that accounted for more than 5 of our fiscal 2003 operating revenue including the federal government our top ten customers represented approximately 36 of operating revenue during fiscal 2003 

  

loss of a major federal government customer such as the va or a gpo relationship could lead to a significant reduction in revenue as could the loss of one or more of our significant individual customers our existing agreement with the va terminates in early calendar 2004 we currently are awaiting the va’s decision as to whether we will be selected to continue as its primary drug distributor or whether one of our competitors will be selected to replace us in whole or in part 

  

if we fail to comply with extensive laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations 

  

we are subject to extensive and frequently changing local state and federal laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud the federal government continues to strengthen its position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting the medicare medicaid and other government healthcare programs our relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare providers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which among other things i preclude persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare medicaid or other governmentsponsored healthcare programs and ii impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under medicare and medicaid programs legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse while we believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws many of the regulations applicable to us including those relating to marketing incentives offered by pharmaceutical suppliers are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations we could suffer civil and criminal penalties including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in medicare medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 

  

our operating results andor financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect 

  

we expect to continue to acquire companies as an element of our growth strategy acquisitions are among the ways we seek to expand our presence in strategically important markets and to expand the breadth and scope of our ancillary business and service offerings at any particular time we may be in various stages of assessment discussion and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions many of which will not be consummated we make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations 

  

acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties if we complete one or more acquisitions our business results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors including the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near term or the longer term the assumption of unknown liabilities the difficulties in the integration of the operations technologies services and products of the acquired companies the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions and other unforeseen difficulties 

  

we anticipate that we will finance acquisitions in the foreseeable future at least partly by the issuance of additional common stock the use of equity financing for acquisitions will dilute the ownership percentage of our then current stockholders

summary segment information – comparative information for fiscal 2002 and 2001 including pro forma information for fiscal 2001 

  

the company’s fiscal 2001 results include a full year of amerisource’s results and approximately one month of bergen’s results in order to enhance comparability to the fiscal 2002 results we have included pro forma information for fiscal 2001 results of operations for purposes of this discussion pro forma refers to the combined results of amerisource and bergen for fiscal 2001 they are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which might have occurred had the operations and management of amerisource and bergen been combined at the beginning of fiscal 2001 the following information also includes the results of operations for the year ended september 30 2001 on a pro forma basis by reportable segment 

  

to further improve the comparability between fiscal years the pro forma combined information for the year ended september 30 2001 excludes amortization of goodwill see note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and reflects the full allocation of bergen’s former corporate segment to the company’s pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments 

  

such pro forma information and the related discussion is limited to the line items comprising operating income due to the changes in the company’s debt structure which occurred in connection with the merger pro forma combined interest expense for fiscal 2001 would not be directly comparable to the company’s fiscal 2002 interest expense

year ended september 30 2003 compared with year ended september 30 2002 

  

consolidated results 

  

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 increased 13 to 455 billion from 402 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 decreased 17 to 41 billion from 50 billion in the prior fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to the company’s conversion of a portion of its bulk and other direct business with its primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the company’s various warehouses due to the insignificant service fees generated from bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume of bulk deliveries have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk deliveries has had a positive impact to the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to the company and the payments by the company to its suppliers 

  

gross profit of 22472 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 11 from 20245 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was 493 as compared to the prioryear percentage of 503 the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments primarily due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures offset in part by the positive aggregate margin impact resulting from the company’s recent acquisitions 

  

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 13551 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 6 compared to 12818 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was 298 compared to 319 in the prior fiscal year the decline in the dsada percentage from the prior fiscal year ratio reflects improvements in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to customer mix changes operational efficiencies and continued benefits from the merger integration effort 

  

in connection with the merger the company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions which are expected to result in synergies of approximately 150 million annually by the end of fiscal 2004 the company’s plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities in the next three to four years this will be accomplished by building six new facilities expanding seven facilities and closing 27 facilities during fiscal 2003 the company began construction activities on three of its new facilities and completed two of the seven facility expansions during fiscal 2003 and 2002 the company closed six and seven distribution facilities respectively the company anticipates closing three additional facilities in fiscal 2004 

  

in september 2001 the company announced plans to close seven distribution facilities in fiscal 2002 consisting of six former amerisource facilities and one former bergen facility a charge of 109 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to the amerisource facilities and included 62 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated 23 million in lease and contract cancellations and 24 million for the writedown of assets related to the facilities to be closed approximately 02 million of costs related to the bergen facility were included in the merger purchase price allocation during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 severance accruals of 18 million recorded in september 2001 were reversed into income because certain employees who were expected to be severed either voluntarily left the company or were retained in other positions within the company 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 the company announced further integration initiatives relating to the closure of bergen’s repackaging facility and the elimination of certain bergen administrative functions including the closure of a related office facility the cost of these initiatives of approximately 192 million which included 158 million of severance for approximately 310 employees to be terminated 16 million for lease cancellation costs and 18 million for the writedown of assets related to the facilities to be closed resulted in additional goodwill being recorded during fiscal 2002 at september 30 2003 substantially all of the 310 employees have been terminated 

  

since september 2002 the company has announced plans to close six distribution facilities in fiscal 2003 and eliminate certain administrative and operational functions “the fiscal 2003 initiatives” as of september 30 2003 the six facilities were 

  

closed during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 the company recorded severance costs of 103 million and lease cancellation costs of 11 million relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives employee severance and lease cancellation costs related to the fiscal 2003 initiatives have been recognized in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards “sfas” no 146 “accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities” employee severance costs are generally expensed during the employee service period and lease cancellation and other costs are generally expensed when the company becomes contractually bound to pay such costs in the future the company expects to incur an additional 10 million of employee severance costs relating to the fiscal 2003 initiatives as of september 30 2003 approximately 520 employees had been provided termination notices as a result of the fiscal 2003 initiatives of which 490 were terminated additional amounts for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced 

  

the company paid a total of 138 million and 156 million for employee severance and lease and contract cancellation costs in the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 and 2002 respectively related to the aforementioned integration plans remaining unpaid amounts of 50 million for employee severance and lease cancellation costs are included in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2003 most employees receive their severance benefits over a period of time generally not to exceed 12 months while others may receive a lumpsum payment 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 the company expensed approximately 242 million of merger costs primarily related to integrating the operations of amerisource and bergen such costs were comprised primarily of consulting fees which amounted to 166 million the merger costs also included a 21 million adjustment to the company’s fourth quarter 2001 charge of 65 million relating to the accelerated vesting of amerisource stock options effective october 1 2002 the company converted its merger integration office to an operations management office accordingly the costs of the operations management office are included within distribution selling and administrative expenses in the company’s consolidated statements of operations 

  

operating income of 8831 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 23 from 7184 million in the prior fiscal year special items reduced the company’s operating income by 89 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 and by 242 million in the prior fiscal year the company’s operating income as a percentage of operating revenue was 194 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 compared to 179 in the prior fiscal year the improvement was primarily due to the lower amount of special items and the aforementioned dsada expense percentage reduction 

  

the company recorded equity in losses of affiliates and other of 80 million and 56 million during the fiscal years ended september 30 2003 and 2002 respectively these amounts primarily consisted of impairment charges relating to investments in technology companies 

  

during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 the company recorded a 42 million loss resulting from the early retirement of debt see note 5 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

interest expense increased 3 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 to 1447 million from 1407 million in the prior fiscal year average borrowings net of invested cash under the company’s debt facilities during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 were 23 billion as compared to average borrowings net of invested cash of 20 billion in the prior fiscal year average borrowing rates under the company’s debt facilities decreased to 56 in the current fiscal year from 61 in the prior fiscal year the increase in average borrowings net of invested cash was primarily a result of additional merchandise inventories on hand during the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year the decrease in average borrowing rates resulted from lower percentages of fixedrate debt outstanding to total debt outstanding in the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year as well as lower market interest rates on variablerate debt 

  

income tax expense of 2849 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an effective tax rate of 392 versus 397 in the prior fiscal year the company has been able to lower its effective tax rate during the current fiscal year by implementing tax planning strategies

net income for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 due to the issuance of company common stock in connection with the acquisitions described in note 2 to the company’s consolidated financial statements and in connection with the exercise of stock options 

  

segment information 

  

pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating revenue of 447 billion for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 13 from 395 billion in the prior fiscal year the company’s recent acquisitions contributed less than 05 of the segment’s operating revenue growth for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 during the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 56 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 44 was from retail customers this compares to a customer mix in the prior fiscal year of 53 institutional and 47 retail in comparison with the prioryear results sales to institutional customers increased 20 primarily due to i the previously mentioned conversion of bulk delivery and other direct business with the company’s primary bulk delivery customer to business serviced through the company’s various warehouses which contributed 4 of the total operating revenue growth ii above market rate growth of the absg specialty pharmaceutical business and iii higher revenues from customers engaged in the mail order sale of pharmaceuticals sales to retail customers increased by 5 in comparison to the prior fiscal year the growth rate of sales to retail customers has declined during fiscal 2003 compared to the fiscal 2002 growth primarily due to lower growth trends in the retail market and the below market growth of certain of the company’s large regional chain customers additionally retail sales in the secondhalf of fiscal 2003 were adversely impacted by the loss of a large customer this segment’s growth largely reflects us pharmaceutical industry conditions including increases in prescription drug utilization and higher pharmaceutical prices offset in part by the increased use of lower priced generics the segment’s growth has also been impacted by industry competition and changes in customer mix industry growth rates as estimated by industry data firm ims healthcare inc are expected to be between 10 and 13 over the next four years future operating revenue growth will continue to be driven by industry growth trends competition within the industry and customer consolidation 

  

pharmaceutical distribution gross profit of 17215 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 12 from 15305 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was 385 as compared to 387 in the prior fiscal year the slight decline in gross profit as a percentage of operating revenue was the net result of the negative impact of a change in customer mix to a higher percentage of large institutional mail order and chain accounts and the continuing competitive pricing environment offset primarily by the positive aggregate impact of recentlyacquired companies which amounted to 15 basis points in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 downward pressures on sellside gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that the inclusion of additional businesses that generate higher margins or that increases in the buyside component of the gross margin including increases derived from manufacturer price increases negotiated deals and secondary market opportunities will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline of the sellside margin the company expects that buyside opportunities may decrease in the future as pharmaceutical manufacturers increasingly seek to control the supply channel through product allocations that limit the inventory the company can purchase and through the imposition of inventory management and other agreements that prohibit or severely restrict the company’s right to purchase inventory from secondary source suppliers although the company seeks in any such agreements to obtain appropriate compensation from pharmaceutical manufacturers for foregoing buyside opportunities there can be no assurance that the agreements will function as intended and replace any or all lost profit opportunities the company’s cost of goods sold includes a lastin firstout “lifo” provision that is affected by changes in inventory quantities product mix and manufacturer pricing practices which may be impacted by market and other external influences 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating expenses of 9333 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 7 from 8713 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 were 209 as compared to 220 in the prior fiscal year the decrease in the expense percentage reflects the changing customer mix described above efficiencies of scale the elimination of redundant costs through the merger integration process the continued emphasis on productivity throughout the company’s distribution network and a reduction of bad debt expense offset in part by higher expense ratios associated with the company’s recent acquisitions 

  

pharmaceutical distribution operating income of 7882 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 reflects an increase of 20 from 6592 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was 176 as compared to 167 in the prior fiscal year the improvement over the prioryear percentage was due to a reduction in the operating expense ratio in excess of the decline in gross margin which was partially the result of the company’s ability to capture synergy cost savings from the merger while management historically has been able to 

  

lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins additionally there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned or result in the desired cost savings 

  

pharmerica segment 

  

pharmerica’s operating revenue increased 9 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 to 16082 million compared to 14750 million in the prior fiscal year this increase is principally attributable to the growth in pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business which has grown at a faster rate than its longterm care business during the secondhalf of fiscal 2003 the growth rate of the workers’ compensation business began to slow down partially due to the loss of a significant customer the slow down in the workers’ compensation business is expected to continue in fiscal 2004 and as a result the operating revenue growth rate in fiscal 2004 for the pharmerica segment is expected to be in the midsingle digits the future operating revenue growth rate will be impacted by competitive pressures changes in the regulatory environment and the pharmaceutical inflation rate 

  

pharmerica’s gross profit of 5256 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 increased 6 from gross profit of 4940 million in the prior fiscal year pharmerica’s gross profit margin declined slightly to 3269 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 from 3349 in the prior fiscal year this decrease is primarily the result of a change in the sales mix with a greater proportion of pharmerica’s current year revenues coming from its workers’ compensation business which has lower gross profit margins and lower operating expenses than its longterm care business in addition industry competitive pressures continue to adversely affect gross profit margins 

  

pharmerica’s operating expenses of 4218 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 increased from 4105 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses were reduced to 2623 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 from 2783 in the prior fiscal year the percentage reduction was primarily due to the continued improvements in operating practices the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers’ compensation business and a reduction in bad debt expense 

  

pharmerica’s operating income of 1038 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 increased by 24 from 835 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating income in the fiscal year ended september 30 2003 was 646 as compared to 566 in the prior fiscal year the improvement was due to the aforementioned reduction in the operating expense ratio which was greater than the reduction in gross profit margin while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future or that expense ratio reductions will exceed possible further declines in gross margins

consolidated results 

  

operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 increased 154 to 402 billion from 158 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase is primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment as a result of the merger operating revenue increased 16 from 346 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis this increase is primarily due to the 16 increase in the pharmaceutical distribution segment 

  

the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products as a result of the merger bulk deliveries increased to 50 billion in the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 compared to 3687 million in the prior fiscal year revenue from bulk deliveries increased 10 from 45 billion in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins however revenue from bulk 

  

deliveries has a positive impact to the company’s cash flows due to favorable timing between the customer payments to us and the payments by us to our suppliers 

  

gross profit of 20245 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 reflects an increase of 189 from 7001 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of 8 from 18807 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis as a percentage of operating revenue gross profit in the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 was 503 as compared to prioryear percentages of 442 on a historical basis and 544 on a pro forma combined basis the increase in the gross profit percentage from prior fiscal year historical results was primarily due to the inclusion of pharmerica in the current year pharmerica due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the company’s pharmaceutical distribution segment the decrease in gross profit percentage in comparison with the prior fiscal year pro forma combined percentage reflects declines in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to changes in customer mix and competitive selling price pressures 

  

distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization “dsada” of 12818 million in the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 reflects an increase of 206 compared to 4194 million in the prior fiscal year on a historical basis and an increase of less than 1 compared to 12764 million in the prior fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis as a percentage of operating revenue dsada in the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 was 319 as compared to prior fiscal year percentages of 265 on a historical basis and 369 on a pro forma combined basis the increases in the dsada percentage from the prior fiscal year historical results were primarily due to the inclusion of pharmerica in the current year as explained above the decrease in the dsada percentage from the prior fiscal year pro forma combined ratio reflects improvements in both the pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica segments due to customer mix changes operational efficiencies and benefits from the merger integration effort 

  

in connection with the merger the company developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions which are expected to result in synergies of approximately 150 million annually by the end of fiscal 2004 the company’s plan is to have a distribution facility network consisting of 30 facilities in the next three to four years this will be accomplished by building six new facilities expanding seven facilities and closing 27 facilities during 2002 the company closed seven distribution facilities

pharmerica’s operating revenue increased 9 for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 to 148 billion compared to 135 billion in the prior fiscal year this increase is principally attributable to growth in pharmerica’s workers’ compensation business which has grown at a faster rate than its longterm care business

pharmerica’s operating expenses of 4105 million for the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 increased 1 from operating expenses of 4069 million in the prior fiscal year as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses were reduced to 2783 in the fiscal year ended september 30 2002 from 3014 in the prior fiscal year the percentage reduction is due to several factors including the aforementioned shift in customer mix towards the workers’ compensation business consolidation of technology platforms the consolidation or sale of several pharmacies and a reduction in bad debt expense

critical accounting policies 

  

critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the company’s financial position and results of operations that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s judgment because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates actual results may differ from these estimates below are those policies applied in preparing the company’s financial statements that management believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions for additional accounting policies see note 1 of “notes to consolidated financial statements” 

  

allowance for doubtful accounts 

  

trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to the company through its pharmaceutical service activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts in determining the appropriate allowance the company considers a combination of factors such as industry trends its customers’ financial strength and credit standing and payment and default history the calculation of the required allowance requires a substantial amount of judgment as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables 

  

merchandise inventories 

  

inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost for approximately 94 and 96 of the company’s inventories at september 30 2003 and 2002 respectively is determined using the lastin firstout lifo method if the company had used the firstin firstout fifo method of inventory valuation which approximates current replacement cost inventories would have been approximately 1856 million and 1523 million higher than the amounts reported at september 30 2003 and 2002 respectively 

  

goodwill and intangible assets 

  

the company adopted financial accounting standards board “fasb” sfas no 142 “goodwill and other intangible assets” as of october 1 2001 under sfas no 142 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized rather they are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis accordingly the company ceased amortization of all goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives as of october 1 2001 intangible assets with finite lives primarily customer lists noncompete agreements and software technology will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 

  

sfas no 142 requires a twostep impairment test for goodwill the first step is to compare the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s assets to the fair value of the reporting unit if the fair value exceeds the carrying value no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value then the second step is required to be completed which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each asset and liability with the excess being implied goodwill an impairment loss occurs if the amount of the recorded goodwill exceeds the implied goodwill the determination of the fair value of the company’s reporting units is based among other things on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit being valued the company is required to complete an impairment test for goodwill and record any resulting impairment losses annually changes in market conditions among other factors may have an impact on these estimates the company completed its required annual impairment tests in the fourth quarters of fiscal 2003 and 2002 and determined that there was no impairment 

  

stock options

the company’s most significant market risk is the effect of changing interest rates the company manages this risk by using a combination of fixedrate and variablerate debt at september 30 2003 the company had approximately 15 billion of fixedrate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 72 and 2950 million of variablerate debt with a weighted average interest rate of 26 the amount of variablerate debt fluctuates during the year based on the company’s working capital requirements the company periodically evaluates various financial instruments that could mitigate a portion of its exposure to variable interest rates however there are no assurances that such instruments will be available on terms acceptable to the company there were no such financial instruments in effect at september 30 2003 for every 100 million of unhedged variablerate debt outstanding a 26 basispoint increase in interest rates onetenth of the average variable rate at september 30 2003 would increase the company’s annual interest expense by 026 million 

  

recently issued financial accounting standards 

  

in may 2003 the fasb issued sfas no 150 “accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity” this statement clarifies the definition of a liability as currently defined by fasb concepts statement no 6 “elements of financial statements” as well as other items the statement requires that financial instruments that embody an obligation of an issuer be classified as a liability furthermore the standard provides guidance for the initial and subsequent measurement as well as disclosure requirements of these financial instruments sfas no 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may 31 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june 15 2003 the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company’s financial position or results of operations 

  

in january 2003 the fasb issued interpretation “fin” no 46 “consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 51” this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 51 “consolidated financial statements” and requires consolidation of variable interest entities by their primary beneficiaries if certain conditions are met this interpretation applies to variable interest entities created or obtained after january 31 2003 for variable interest entities created or obtained before february 1 2003 the adoption of this standard is effective as of december 31 2003 for a variable interest in specialpurpose entities and as of march 31 2004 for all other variable interest entities the company did not create or obtain any variable interest entity after january 31 2003 the company is in the process of evaluating the adoption of this standard as it relates to variable interest entities held by the company prior to february 1 2003 but does not believe it will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 

  

in december 2002 the fasb issued sfas no 148 “accounting for stockbased compensation – transition and disclosure” sfas no 148 amends sfas no 123 “accounting for stockbased compensation” to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 123’s fair value method of accounting for stockbased employee compensation sfas no 148 also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 123 and accounting principles board opinion no 28 “interim financial reporting” to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity’s accounting policy with respect to stockbased employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements the adoption of the standard was effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december 15 2002 

  

the company did not adopt the fair value method of accounting for stockbased compensation as required the company adopted the disclosure provisions of this standard see notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements 

  

in november 2002 the fasb issued fin no 45 “guarantor’s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others” this interpretation enhances the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at the inception of a guarantee a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement requirements of fin no 45 did not have an impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements

 item 1 business   amerisourcebergen corporation amerisourcebergen or the company was formed in connection with the merger between amerisource health corporation amerisource and bergen brunswig corporation bergen which was consummated in august 2001 the merger as a result of the merger amerisourcebergen is the largest pharmaceutical services company in the united states that is dedicated solely to the pharmaceutical supply chain we believe that we are the leading wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products and services to hospital systems hospitals and acute care facilities alternate care customers mail order facilities physicians offices longterm care institutions and clinics independent community pharmacies and regional drugstore and food merchandising chains also a leader in the institutional pharmacy marketplace we provide outsourced pharmacies to longterm care and workers compensation programs

  we currently serve our customers in all 50 states the district of columbia puerto rico and guam through a geographically diverse network of distribution centers we are typically the primary source of supply for pharmaceutical and related products to our customers we offer a broad range of solutions to our customers and suppliers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply chain

  amerisourcebergen was incorporated in delaware in march 2001 the address of the principal executive office of the company is po box 959 valley forge pennsylvania 19482 the telephone number is 610 7277000 and our web site is wwwamerisourcebergennet

      business strategy   amerisourcebergens business strategy is anchored in national pharmaceutical distribution and services reinforced by the valueadded healthcare solutions we provide our customers and suppliers this focused strategy has significantly expanded our predecessors businesses over the past five years and we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy

 continue growth in existing markets we believe that we are wellpositioned to continue to grow in our existing markets by i providing superior distribution services to our customers and suppliers which is reflected in the consistently high rankings achieved by our predecessor companies in recent customer service surveys ii delivering valueadded solutions which improve the efficiencies and competitiveness of both customers and suppliers allowing the supply chain to better deliver healthcare to patients and consumers iii maintaining our lowcost operating structure to ensure that the companys services are priced competitively in the marketplace and iv maintaining our decentralized operating structure to respond to customers needs more quickly and efficiently and to ensure the continued development of local and regional management talent      expand growth through healthcare solutions for customers we are continually enhancing our services and packaging these services into programs designed to enable customers to improve sales and compete more effectively these solutions also increase customer loyalty and strengthen amerisourcebergens overall role in the pharmaceutical supply chain they include iecho and ibergen our proprietary internetbased ordering systems family pharmacy and good neighbor pharmacy which enable independent community pharmacies and small chain drugstores to compete more effectively through access to pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs disease management services and pharmaceutical care programs and bestpriced generic product purchasing services pharmacy healthcare solutions which provides hospital pharmacy consulting to improve operational efficiencies amerisourcebergen specialty group absg which delivers a comprehensive supply of diseasestate based products in oncology vaccines injectables and plasma to a variety of providers of healthcare american health packaging which delivers unit dose punch card and unitofuse packaging for institutional and retail pharmacy customers and rita ann our cosmetic distributor      expand growth through healthcare solutions for suppliers we have been developing solutions for suppliers to improve the efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain programs for suppliers to assist with rapid new product launches promotional and marketing services to accelerate product sales custom packaging solutions and product data reporting are examples of valueadded solutions currently offered we believe these services will continue to expand further contributing to our revenue and income growth we also intend to acquire companies that deliver complementary valueadded products and services to our existing customers and suppliers      improve operating and capital efficiencies we believe we have one of the lowest operating cost structures among our major national competitors we have developed merger integration plans to consolidate our existing distribution facility network and establish new more efficient distribution centers we also intend to further reduce operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue by eliminating duplicate administrative functions and by gaining enhanced procurement efficiencies these measures are designed to reduce marginal operating costs provide greater access to financing sources and reduce the cost of capital in addition we believe we will continue to achieve productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse automation technology adopt best practices in warehousing activities and increase operating leverage by increasing volume per fullservice distribution facility 

      industry overview   we have benefited from the significant growth of the fullservice wholesale pharmaceutical distribution industry in the united states according to an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry industry sales grew from approximately 68 billion in 1995 to approximately 140 billion in 2000 and are expected to grow to approximately 264 billion in 2005

  the factors contributing to the growth of the fullservice pharmaceutical distribution industry in the united states and other favorable industry trends include

  aging population  the number of individuals over age 65 in the united states grew from approximately 31 million in 1990 to approximately 35 million in 2000 and is projected to increase to more than 39 million by the year 2010 this age group suffers from a greater incidence of chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is estimated to account for approximately twothirds of total healthcare expenditures in the united states

  introduction of new pharmaceuticals  traditional research and development as well as the advent of new research production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene research and therapy continue to generate new compounds and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases these compounds have been responsible for significant increases in pharmaceutical sales we believe that ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry

  increased use of outpatient drug therapies  in response to rising healthcare costs governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases while national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs we believe that drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on overall healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays pharmaceuticals currently account for less than 11 of overall healthcare costs and manufacturers emphasis on research and development is expected to continue the introduction of costeffective drug therapies

  rising pharmaceutical prices  consistent with historical trends we believe that pharmaceutical price increases will continue to equal or exceed the overall consumer price index we believe that these increases will be due in large part to the relatively inelastic demand in the face of higher prices charged for patented drugs as manufacturers have attempted to recoup costs associated with the development clinical testing and federal drug administration fda approval of new products

  expiration of patents for brand name pharmaceuticals  a significant number of patents for widely used brand name pharmaceutical products will expire in the next several years these products are expected to be marketed by generic manufacturers and distributed by us we consider this a favorable trend because generic products have historically provided a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand name products

      operations   operating structure amerisourcebergen operates in two segments pharmaceutical distribution primarily our wholesale and specialty drug distribution business and pharmerica our institutional pharmacy business 

  pharmaceutical distribution the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes our core wholesale drug distribution business absg our pharmaceutical alternate care distribution business and american health packaging our pharmaceutical repackaging business pharmaceutical distribution also includes a number of smaller specialty units in areas such as management reimbursement consulting services cosmetics distribution and third party logistics services for pharmaceutical manufacturers amerisourcebergen is the largest distributor of pharmaceutical products and services in the united states

  we principally distribute a full line of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals and overthecounter medications throughout the united states from distribution centers in 44 states and puerto rico these products are sold to institutional pharmacies including hospitals clinics doctors offices and mail order pharmacies and retail pharmacies such as independent community pharmacies and regional drugstore and food merchandising chain stores

  our core wholesale drug distribution business is organized into seven regions across the united states unlike our more centralized competitors we are structured as an organization of locally managed profit centers we believe that the delivery of healthcare is local and therefore the management of each distribution facility has responsibility for its own customer service and financial performance these facilities utilize the companys corporate staff for nationalregional account management marketing data processing financial purchasing human resources legal and executive management resources and corporate coordination of asset and working capital management

  pharmerica our second operating segment is pharmerica a leading national provider of institutional pharmacy services in longterm care and alternate care settings pharmerica also provides mailorder pharmacy services to chronically and catastrophically ill patients under workers compensation programs

  pharmericas institutional pharmacy business involves the purchase of bulk quantities of prescription and nonprescription pharmaceuticals principally from the companys pharmaceutical distribution segment and the distribution of those products to residents in longterm care facilities unlike hospitals most longterm care facilities do not have onsite pharmacies to dispense prescription drugs but depend instead on institutional pharmacies such as pharmerica to provide the necessary pharmacy products and services and to play an integral role in monitoring patient medication pharmericas pharmacies dispense pharmaceuticals in patientspecific packaging in accordance with physician orders in addition pharmerica provides infusion therapy services and medicare part b products as well as formulary management and other pharmacy consulting services

  pharmericas network of 131 locations covers a geographic area that includes over 85 of the nations institutionallongterm care beds each pharmerica pharmacy typically serves customers within a 150mile radius pharmericas workers compensation business provides pharmaceutical claims administration and mailorder distribution pharmericas services include home delivery of prescription drugs medical supplies and equipment and an array of computer software solutions to reduce the payors administrative costs 

  sales and marketing we have approximately 500 sales professionals organized regionally and specialized by customer type customer service representatives are located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner in addition a specially trained group of telemarketing representatives makes regular contact with customers regarding special promotions our corporate marketing department designs and develops the amerisourcebergen array of valueadded customer solutions tailored to specific customer groups these programs can be further customized at the distribution facility level to adapt to local market conditions corporate sales and marketing also serves national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers

  facilities each of our distribution facilities carries an inventory suited to the needs of the local market the efficient distribution of small orders is possible through the extensive use of computerization and modern warehouse techniques these include computerized warehouse product location routing and inventory replenishment systems gravityflow racking mechanized order selection and efficient truck loading and routing we typically deliver our products to our customers on a daily basis we utilize a fleet of owned and leased vans and trucks and contract carriers night product picking operations in our distribution facilities have further reduced delivery time orders are generally delivered in less than 24 hours

  customers and markets we have a diverse customer base that includes acute care hospitals health systems independent community pharmacies mail order pharmacies alternate care facilities and regional retail drugstore chains including pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers we are typically the primary source of supply for our customers in addition we offer a broad range of valueadded solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers during fiscal 2001 amerisourcebergens reported operating revenue for its pharmaceutical distribution segment was comprised of a sales mix of approximately 53 institutional and 47 retail pharmaceutical distribution segment operating revenue is expected to be approximately 52 institutional and 48 retail in fiscal 2002

  the veterans administration represented 16 of amerisourcebergens reported operating revenue in fiscal 2001 7 of pro forma combined amerisource and bergen operating revenue in fiscal 2001 including the veterans administration amerisourcebergens top ten customers represented 26 of reported operating revenue during fiscal 2001 27 of pro forma combined amerisource and bergen operating revenue in fiscal 2001

  suppliers historically amerisourcebergen obtained pharmaceutical and other products from a number of manufacturers none of which accounted for more than 10 of amerisourcebergens operating revenue in fiscal 2001 the five largest suppliers in fiscal 2001 accounted for 36 of amerisourcebergens operating revenue amerisourcebergen has not experienced difficulty in purchasing desired products from suppliers in the past we currently have agreements with many of our suppliers which generally require us to maintain an adequate inventory of a suppliers products the majority of contracts with suppliers are terminable upon 30 days notice by either party the loss of certain suppliers could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable we believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good

  management information systems we continually invest in advanced management information systems and automated warehouse technology our management information systems provide for among other things electronic order entry by customers invoice preparation and purchasing and inventory tracking as a result of electronic order entry the cost of receiving and processing orders has not increased as rapidly as sales volume our customized systems strengthen customer relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for a number of the valueadded services offered to our customers including marketing data inventory replenishment singlesource billing computer price updates and price labels

  amerisourcebergen operates its full service pharmaceutical distribution facilities on two different centralized management information systems one is the former amerisource system and the other is the former bergen system we are now in the process of integrating the systems into a common system while maintaining our customers ability to access the system through the orderentry system used by either company this process is complex and will take several years to complete

  we plan to continue to make system investments to further improve our information capabilities and meet our customer and operational needs currently we are expanding our electronic interface with suppliers and now electronically process a substantial portion of our purchase orders invoices and payments we also intend to expand our use of warehouse management systems

      competition   we engage in the wholesale distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions in a highly competitive environment we compete with both national and regional distributors our national competitors include cardinal health inc and mckesson corporation in addition we compete with regional and local distributors directselling manufacturers warehousing chain drugstores and other specialty distributors competitive factors include valueadded service programs breadth of product price service and delivery credit terms and customer support

  pharmericas competitors principally include national institutional pharmacies and longterm care companyowned captive pharmacies we believe that the competitive factors most important in pharmericas lines of business are quality and range of service offered pricing reputation with referral sources ease of doing business with the provider and the ability to develop and maintain relationships with referral sources one of pharmericas competitors is significantly larger than pharmerica in addition there are relatively few barriers to entry in the local markets served by pharmerica and it may encounter substantial competition from local market entrants pharmerica competes with numerous billing companies in connection with the portion of its business which electronically adjudicates workers compensation claims for payors

      employees   as of september 30 2001 the company employed approximately 13700 persons of which approximately 12200 were fulltime employees approximately 7 of full and parttime employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements the company believes that its relationship with its employees is good

      regulatory   the united states drug enforcement administration the fda and various state boards of pharmacy regulate the distribution of pharmaceutical products and controlled substances requiring wholesale distributors of these substances to register for permits and to meet various security and operating standards as a wholesale distributor of pharmaceuticals and certain related products the company is subject to these regulations the company has received all necessary regulatory approvals and believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable wholesale distribution requirements

  the company particularly in its pharmerica operations andor its customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws which preclude among other things a persons from soliciting offering receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or for inducing the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by medicare or medicaid and b physicians from making referrals to certain entities with which they have a financial relationship the fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation

  as part of various changes made to medicare in 1997 the united states congress established the prospective payment system pps for medicare patients in skilled nursing facilities pps pays a federal daily rate for virtually all covered skilled nursing facility services under pps pharmericas skilled nursing facility customers are no longer able to pass through their costs for certain products and services provided by pharmerica instead pharmericas customers receive a federal daily rate to cover the costs of all eligible goods and services provided to medicare patients which may include certain pharmaceutical and other goods and services provided by pharmerica that were previously reimbursed separately under medicare since the amount of skilled nursing facility medicare reimbursement is limited by pps facility customers now have an increased incentive to negotiate with pharmerica to minimize the costs of providing goods and services to patients covered under medicare pharmerica continues to bill skilled nursing facilities on a negotiated fee schedule

  pharmericas reimbursements for pharmaceuticals provided under state medicaid programs are also subject to government regulation since mid2000 pharmerica has experienced the negative impact of two regulatory events which reduced reimbursements under state medicaid programs and it is expected that such lower reimbursements will continue into future years the first event was the announcement by approximately 34 states of a significant reduction in average wholesale price reimbursement levels for certain intravenous drugs provided to medicaid beneficiaries the second event was the center for medicare and medicaid services reduction of federal upper limit prices which are used to set the reimbursement levels for numerous pills and tablets dispensed to medicaid beneficiaries

 item 7 managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein

impact of the merger

  amerisourcebergen corporation the company is a leading national wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products and related healthcare services and solutions with approximately 35 billion in annualized operating revenue the company was formed in connection with the merger of amerisource health corporation amerisource and bergen brunswig corporation bergen which was consummated on august 29 2001 the merger

  the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of bergen under the purchase method of accounting using the new guidelines for business combinations issued by the financial accounting standards board see note 2 under the purchase method of accounting the estimated cost of approximately 24 billion to acquire bergen including transaction costs was allocated to its underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values the 23 billion excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill and intangible assets

  the company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers the companys operating segments have been aggregated into two reportable segments pharmaceutical distribution and pharmerica

  the pharmaceutical distribution segment includes amerisourcebergen drug company abdc and amerisourcebergen specialty group absg abdc includes the fullservice pharmaceutical distribution facilities american health packaging and other healthcare related businesses abdc sells pharmaceuticals overthecounter medicines health and beauty aids and other healthrelated products to hospitals managed care facilities and independent and chain retail pharmacies american health packaging packages oral solid medications for nearly any need in virtually all settings of patient care abdc also provides promotional inventory management and information services to its customers absg sells specialty pharmaceutical products to physicians clinics and other providers in the nephrology oncology plasma and vaccines sectors absg also provides third party logistics and reimbursement consulting services to healthcare product manufacturers

  the pharmerica segment consists solely of the companys pharmerica operations pharmerica provides institutional pharmacy products and services to patients in longterm care and alternate site settings including skilled nursing facilities assisted living facilities and residential living communities it also provides mail order and online pharmacy services to injured workers who are receiving workers compensation benefits homebound catastrophicallyill patients and other consumers

  the accompanying historical consolidated statements of operations and statements of cash flows for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 and the consolidated balance sheet as of september 30 2000 reflect only the results of amerisource as predecessor to the company as a result the companys historical operating results and cash flows for fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 and the companys financial position as of september 30 2000 are not comparable to fiscal 2001 because of the merger fiscal 2001 results include a full year of amerisource and approximately one month of bergens results accordingly in order to enhance comparability the following discussion of results of operations includes pro forma revenue information for purposes of this discussion pro forma refers to the combined results of amerisource and bergen in each respective fiscal year

 

results of operations

  year ended september 30 2001 compared with year ended september 30 2000       consolidated results 

  operating revenue which excludes bulk deliveries for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 increased 36 to 158 billion from 116 billion in the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased operating revenue in the pharmaceutical distribution segment excluding the revenue impact from the merger operating revenue increased 20 for the full fiscal year on a pro forma combined basis operating revenue increased 14 versus the prior year

  the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products as a result of the merger bulk deliveries increased to 3687 million in fiscal 2001 from 350 million in fiscal 2000 excluding the impact from the merger bulk deliveries would have decreased to 11 million for fiscal 2001 on a pro forma combined basis revenue from bulk deliveries of 45 billion in fiscal 2001 increased 7 versus the prior year due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins 

  gross profit of 7001 million in fiscal 2001 increased by 35 as compared to the prior year as a percentage of operating revenue the gross profit in fiscal 2001 was 442 as compared to 448 in the prior year the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily the result of a 29 basis point decrease in the pharmaceutical distribution segment which was offset in part by the impact of the inclusion of one month of pharmericas results pharmerica due to the nature of its prescription fulfillment business has significantly higher gross margins and operating expense ratios than the companys pharmaceutical distribution segment excluding the impact of the merger gross profit increased 12 for the full fiscal year and as a percentage of operating revenue was 416 in fiscal 2001 as compared to 448 in the prior year 

  distribution selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization increased by 1009 million or 32 in fiscal 2001 as compared to the prior year and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to 265 in fiscal 2001 from 274 in fiscal 2000 due to a 29 basis point decrease in the pharmaceutical distribution segment ratio offset in part by the inclusion of one month of pharmerica results excluding the impact of the merger distribution selling and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization increased 7 for the full fiscal year and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to 244 in fiscal 2001 from 274 in fiscal 2000 

  in connection with the merger the company has developed integration plans to consolidate its distribution network and eliminate duplicate administrative functions which are expected to result in synergies of approximately 150 million annually at the end of the third year following the merger the company intends to reduce the number of distribution facilities from 51 at september 30 2001 to approximately 30 over the next three to four years and has announced plans to close seven facilities in fiscal 2002 a charge of 109 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 related to these plans and included 62 million of severance for approximately 260 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated 23 million in lease cancellations and 24 million in the writedown of assets related to the facilities to be closed accrued expenses of 71 million related to this charge are included in the consolidated balance sheet at september 30 2001 additional shutdown charges for integration initiatives will be recognized in subsequent periods as facilities to be consolidated are identified and specific plans are approved and announced

  in connection with its acquisition of bergen the company incurred merger costs of 131 million in fiscal 2001 consisting primarily of consulting fees of 56 million and a 65 million charge for the accelerated vesting of amerisource stock options additional merger costs including merger integration and employee retention costs will be charged to expense in subsequent periods when incurred these costs are expected to be between 20 million and 30 million in fiscal 2002

  the companys amerisource corporation subsidiary is subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations at one of its former distribution centers that may require the company to make remediation efforts in fiscal 1994 the company accrued 41 million to cover future consulting legal remediation and ongoing monitoring costs during fiscal 2001 environmental reserves of 27 million were reversed into income based on a new engineering analysis prepared by outside consultants that was completed in september 2001 the remaining liability of 10 million at september 30 2001 is reflected in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet this accrued liability represents the current estimate of the extent of contamination and choice of remedy based on existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations however changes in remediation standards improvements in cleanup technology and discovery of additional information concerning the site could affect the estimated liability in the future 

  during fiscal 2000 severance accruals of 11 million relating to the fiscal 1999 facility consolidation and 1998 restructuring efforts were reversed into income after employees expected to be severed either left the company before receiving their benefits or were retained in other positions within the company

  operating income of 2594 million for the year ended september 30 2001 increased by 28 from the prior year excluding the facility consolidations and employee severance charge the merger costs and the environmental remediation credit special items in both years described above and the impact of the merger in fiscal 2001 the increase in operating income was 19 and the companys operating margin was 172 in fiscal 2001 as compared to 173 in fiscal 2000

  equity in losses of affiliates and other were 109 million in fiscal 2001 and 06 million in fiscal 2000 these results primarily reflect the fullyear impact of the companys equity investment in healthnexis llc that was accounted for on the equity method and the writedown of the companys investment in a technology company healthnexis llc subsequently merged with the global health exchange in november 2001

  interest expense of 457 million in fiscal 2001 represents an increase of 9 compared to the prior year excluding the impact of the merger interest expense in fiscal 2001 decreased 11 compared to the prioryear period this decrease reflects the positive impact of 3000 million of 5 fixedrate convertible notes issued by the company in december of 2000 and a decrease of approximately 50 basis points in average borrowing rates under the companys variablerate debt facilities which more than offset the increase in average levels of debt excluding the impact of the merger and the related refinancings described below average borrowings during the year ended september 30 2001 were 614 million as compared to average borrowings of 612 million in the prior year

  income tax expense of 777 million in fiscal 2001 reflected an effective tax rate of 383 versus 380 in the prior fiscal year this slight increase in the effective rate reflects the inclusion of one month of bergens operating results the company expects the effective tax rate to be between 39 and 40 in fiscal 2002 as a result of the merger 

  net income of 1238 million represents an increase of 25 over the prior year excluding special items in both years adjusted net income of 1370 million increased 39 compared to the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased 11 to 210 per share as compared to 190 per share in the prior year diluted earnings per share excluding special items increased 22 to 231 per share as compared to 189 per share in the prior year diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2001 includes the impact of the shares issued to effect the merger and the shares assumed issued under the 5 convertible subordinated notes

      segment information pharmaceutical distribution segment

  operating revenue for the pharmaceutical distribution segment for the fiscal year ended september 30 2001 increased 36 to 158 billion from 116 billion in the prior fiscal year excluding the impact of the merger operating revenue increased 20 during the year ended september 30 2001 53 of operating revenue was from sales to institutional customers and the remaining 47 was from retail customers in fiscal 2000 the customer mix was 51 institutional and 49 retail during the year ended september 30 2001 sales to institutional customers increased 42 and sales to retail customers increased 29 excluding the impact of the merger institutional operating revenue increased 26 and retail operating revenue increased 14 the increase in institutional operating revenue was primarily due to revenue growth with the novation group purchasing organization gpo and the veterans administration as well as significant increases in the alternate site customer group during calendar 2000 members of the novation gpo went through a distributor selection process and as a result the company added over 500 million in annualized operating revenue in fiscal 2001 operating revenue from the veterans administration accounted for approximately 30 of total institutional operating revenue alternate site sales increased 54 during fiscal 2001 due to the fullyear impact of a mail order customer added in the third quarter of the prior year which accounted for 20 of the increase in addition numerous new alternate site accounts were added during the year the increase in retail operating revenue was consistent with overall industry growth rates future operating revenue growth may be impacted by customer consolidation and competition within the industry as well as industry growth rates

  in the pharmaceutical distribution segment gross profit of 6604 million in fiscal 2001 increased by 27 as compared to the prior year as a percentage of operating revenue the gross profit in fiscal 2001 was 419 as compared to 448 in the prior year the yeartoyear decline reflects the net impact of a number of factors including the change in customer mix to a higher level of larger institutional mail order and chain accounts and the continuing competitive pricing environment offset in part by higher buyside margins than in the prior year downward pressures on sellside gross profit margin are expected to continue and there can be no assurance that increases in the buyside component of the gross margin including manufacturer price increases and negotiated deals will be available in the future to fully or partially offset the anticipated decline gross profit was adversely impacted in fiscal 2001 by a 56 million write down of inventory primarily related to the companys decision to exit the designer fragrance business at its cosmetic distribution subsidiary 

  total operating expenses excluding special items increased 21 in the pharmaceutical distribution segment to 3862 million primarily the result of the merger as a percentage of operating revenue operating expenses decreased to 245 in fiscal 2001 from 274 in the prior year this decrease reflects the changing customer mix described above and efficiencies of scale as well as the continued elimination of costs and productivity improvements throughout the companys distribution network

  total operating income before special items increased 36 in the pharmaceutical distribution segment to 2742 million as a percentage of operating revenue operating income before special items was 174 in fiscal 2001 and 173 in the prior year reflecting the net effect of the decline in gross margins offset by the reduction in operating expenses discussed above while management historically has been able to lower expense ratios and expects to continue to do so there can be no assurance that reductions will occur in the future or that expenseratio reductions will exceed possible declines in gross margins additionally there can be no assurance that merger integration efforts will proceed as planned and result in the desired synergies

pharmerica segment

  the pharmerica segment was acquired in connection with the merger and its operating revenue of 1167 million and operating income of 65 million for the year ended september 30 2001 reflects approximately one month of operating results on a pro forma basis pharmericas fiscal 2001 operating revenue increased 6 to 135 billion from 127 billion in the prior year 

intersegment eliminations

  these amounts represent the elimination of the pharmaceutical distribution segments sales to pharmerica amerisourcebergen drug company is the principal supplier of pharmaceuticals to pharmerica 

      year ended september 30 2000 compared with year ended september 30 1999   operating revenue for the fiscal year ended september 30 2000 increased 19 to 116 billion from 98 billion in the prior fiscal year during the fiscal year ended september 30 2000 sales to health systems increased 22 sales to alternate site facilities increased 59 sales to independent drugstore customers increased 11 and sales to the chain drugstore customer group increased 12 compared to the prior year during the year ended september 30 2000 sales to health systems and alternate site facilities accounted for 51 of total operating revenue while sales to independent community pharmacies accounted for 37 and sales to chain drugstores accounted for 12 of the total the increase in health systems revenue was primarily due to 37 revenue growth with the veterans administration which accounted for 19 and 17 of the total operating revenue for the fiscal years ended september 30 2000 and 1999 respectively the balance of the health systems growth was due to growth from existing relationships with group purchasing organizations several new alternate site customers were added as a result of the companys sales reorganization in the prior year which created a national and regional alternate site sales force approximately 15 of the alternate site revenue growth was from a new contract with a mail order facility which started in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 the increase in independent community pharmacy and chain drugstore revenue was consistent with overall industry growth 

  the company reports as revenue bulk deliveries to customer warehouses whereby the company acts as an intermediary in the ordering and delivery of pharmaceutical products bulk deliveries decreased 26 to 350 million in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 due to the insignificant service fees generated from these bulk deliveries fluctuations in volume have no significant impact on operating margins

  gross profit of 5196 million in fiscal 2000 increased by 10 as compared to the prior year due primarily to the increase in operating revenue as a percentage of operating revenue the gross profit in fiscal 2000 was 448 as compared to 485 in the prioryear period the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily due to changes in the customer mix which included more lowermargin health systems business than in the prior year and price competition within the pharmaceutical distribution industry

  distribution selling and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization increased by 194 million or 6 in fiscal 2000 as compared to the prior year and decreased as a percentage of operating revenue to 273 in fiscal 2000 from 304 in fiscal 1999 this improvement reflects the changing customer mix to more health systems business including the veterans administration which is lower gross margin business but requires lower operating expense as a percentage of revenue to service the improvement also reflects warehouse efficiencies and cost reductions related to the companys fiscal 1998 and 1999 restructuring efforts these factors were offset in part by an increase in the bad debt provision to 103 million for fiscal 2000 compared to a 70 million provision in the prior year the bad debt increase was primarily due to certain customer business failures during the year 

  in fiscal 1999 the company acquired cd smith healthcare inc during fiscal 2000 the company closed cd smiths chicago illinois pharmaceutical distribution facility and completed the consolidation of cd smiths pharmaceutical packaging business in addition the company completed the conversion of the remaining two cd smith facilities to a centralized system for data processing and other administrative services a charge of 128 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 related to these efforts which included a 72 million writedown of goodwill and fixed assets related to the chicago facility 35 million of contract and lease cancellations and other costs primarily relating to the expected termination of a noncancelable supply contract and 21 million of severance for approximately 90 warehouse and administrative personnel to be terminated as a result of the facility consolidation and centralization as of september 30 2000 all of the restructuring efforts were completed except for the final resolution of the noncancelable supply contract which was settled in november 2000 severance accruals of 05 million related to the fiscal 1999 charge were reversed into income during the third quarter of fiscal 2000 primarily related to the decision to retain a manager previously anticipated to be terminated

  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 the company began to centralize its data processing accounting contract administration and purchasing functions reorganize its pharmaceutical distribution facilities into five regions and consolidate two pharmaceutical distribution facilities a charge of 83 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1998 related to these efforts and included severance of 33 million for approximately 350 administrative and warehouse personnel and asset writedowns and lease cancellation costs of 50 million as of september 30 2000 all of the companys pharmaceutical distribution facilities were converted to the centralized system and substantially all of the 350 positions have been eliminated in the third quarter of fiscal 2000 the company reversed restructuring accruals related to the fiscal 1998 charge of approximately 06 million representing severance not paid to employees because they either left the company before receiving their benefits or took other positions within the company this 06 million reversal combined with the 05 million reversal of the fiscal 1999 charge described above is included in the facility consolidations and employee severance line in the companys statement of operations in fiscal 1999 the company reversed 11 million of cost originally accrued during fiscal 1997 for facility consolidations and employee severance due to 08 million of proceeds in excess of estimates for disposed assets and 03 million of severance settled for less than original estimates

  operating income of 2021 million in the year ended september 30 2000 increased by 27 from the prior year in part because of the 11 million restructuring charge reversal in fiscal 2000 as compared to the 149 million in facility consolidations employee severance and merger costs in fiscal 1999 excluding these items in both years the increase in operating income was 15 and the companys operating margin was 173 in fiscal 2000 as compared to 178 in fiscal 1999 the decrease is due to the reduction in gross margin described above offset in part by the decrease in distribution selling and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of operating revenue

  interest expense of 419 million in fiscal 2000 represents an increase of 6 compared to the prior year the increase from the prioryear expense reflects higher interest rates offset in part by lower average levels of debt and lower borrowing spreads the increase in average market interest rates during fiscal 2000 was approximately 106 basis points compared to fiscal 1999 average borrowings during the year ended september 30 2000 were 612 million as compared to average borrowings of 625 million in the prior fiscal year

  income tax expense of 607 million in fiscal 2000 reflected an effective tax rate of 380 versus 406 in the prior fiscal year the reduction in the effective rate was primarily due to the effect of the nondeductible goodwill writedown and merger costs which occurred in fiscal 1999

  income before extraordinary items of 990 million represents an increase of 40 over the prior year excluding facility consolidation and employee severance and merger costs in both years income before extraordinary items of 983 million increased 19 compared to the prior fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased 45 from the prior year to 190 per share as compared to 131 per share in the prior year
