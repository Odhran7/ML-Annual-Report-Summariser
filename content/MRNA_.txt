moderna is pioneering a new class of medicines made of messenger rna or mrna the potential implications of using mrna as a drug are significant and farreaching and could meaningfully improve how medicines are discovered developed manufactured and administered 

since our founding in 2010 we have transformed from a researchstage company advancing programs in the field of mrna to a commercial enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mrna and lipid nanoparticle lnp formulation and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale moderna has established relationships with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of our manufacturing capabilities most recently moderna’s capabilities have come together to allow the authorization and approval of one of the earliest and mosteffective vaccines against the covid19 pandemic 

in 2020 mrna technology emerged as a new class of medicine in under a year we designed our vaccine against covid19 mrna1273 using mrnabased technology conducted clinical trials which demonstrated that the vaccine was highly effective at preventing covid19 and obtained an emergency use authorization eua from the us food and drug administration fda and authorizations from other regulators around the world during 2021 we shipped more than 800 million doses of our covid19 vaccine to countries around the globe to help fight the pandemic with approximately 25 of those doses going to low and middleincome countries in january 2022 the fda approved the biologics license application bla for our covid19 vaccine spikevax ®  for individuals 18 years of age and older in the united states 

the mrna opportunity 

mrna the software of life 

mrna transfers the information stored in our genes to the cellular machinery that makes all the proteins required for life our genes are stored as sequences of dna which contain the instructions to make specific proteins dna serves as a hard drive safely storing these instructions in the nucleus until they are needed by the cell 

when a cell needs to produce a protein the instructions to make that protein are copied from the dna to mrna which serves as the template for protein production each mrna molecule contains the instructions to produce a specific protein with a distinct function in the body mrna transmits those instructions to cellular machinery called ribosomes that make copies of the required protein 

we see mrna functioning as the “software of life” every cell uses mrna to provide real time instructions to make the proteins necessary to drive all aspects of biology including in human health and disease this was codified as the central dogma of molecular biology over 50 years ago and is exemplified in the schematic below 

the structure of mrna 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprising four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the molecule that codes for a protein or the coding region the sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons the first codon or start codon aug signals where the ribosome should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein to end protein synthesis three different codons uaa uag and uga 

serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis in total there are 64 potential codons but only 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins therefore multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid 

the process of protein production is called translation because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids the coding region is analogous to a sentence in english much like a start codon a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

in every cell hundreds of thousands of mrnas make hundreds of millions of proteins every day a typical protein contains 200600 amino acids therefore a typical mrna coding region ranges from 6001800 nucleotides in addition to the coding region mrnas contain four other key features 1 the 5’ untranslated region or 5’utr 2 the 3’ untranslated region or 3’utr 3 the 5’ cap and 4 a 3’ polyadenosine or polya tail the sequence of nucleotides in the 5’utr influences how efficiently the ribosome initiates protein synthesis whereas the sequence of nucleotides in the 3’utr contains information about which cell types should translate that mrna and how long the mrna should last the 5’ cap and 3’ polya tail enhance ribosome engagement and protect the mrna from attack by intracellular enzymes that digest mrna from its ends 

the intrinsic advantages of using mrna as a medicine 

mrna possesses inherent characteristics that we believe provide it with a strong foundation as a new class of medicines these characteristics include 

• mrna is used by every cell to produce all proteins mrna is used to make every type of protein including secreted membrane and intracellular proteins in varying quantities over time in different locations and in various combinations given the universal role of mrna in protein production we believe that mrna medicines could have broad applicability across human disease 

• making proteins inside one’s own cells mimics human biology using a person’s own cells to produce protein therapeutics or vaccine antigens provides certain advantages over existing technologies such as recombinant proteins which are manufactured using processes that are foreign to the human body 

• mrna has a simple and flexible chemical structure each mrna molecule comprises four chemically similar nucleotides to encode proteins made from up to 20 chemically different amino acids to make the full diversity of possible proteins only simple sequence changes are required in mrna 

• mrna has classic pharmacologic features mrna possesses many of the attractive pharmacologic features of most modern medicines including reproducible activity predictable potency and wellbehaved dose dependency mrna also provides the ability to adjust dosing based on an individual patient’s needs including stopping or lowering the dose to seek to ensure safety and tolerability 

mrna as a new class of medicines 

unlike traditional approaches to medicine where a protein or chemical is introduced to the body we send tailored mrna into cells to instruct them to produce specific proteins instead of starting from scratch for each new vaccine or therapy our mrna approach 

leverages the technology and fundamental components that we have been researching and developing since our founding our success in developing manufacturing and commercializing the moderna covid19 vaccine further supports our belief that mrnabased medicines as a class have the potential to help patients in farreaching ways that could exceed the impact of traditional approaches to medicine 

we have developed four core beliefs about the value drivers of mrna as a new class of medicines 

1 mrna has the potential to create an unprecedented abundance and diversity of medicines mrna’s breadth of applicability has the potential to create an extraordinary number of new mrnabased medicines that are currently beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology 

2 advances in the development of our mrna medicines reduce risks across our portfolio mrna medicines share fundamental features that can be used to learn quickly across a portfolio we believe that once safety and proof of protein production has been established in one program the technology and biology risks of related programs that use similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes will decrease significantly 

3 mrna technology can accelerate discovery and development the softwarelike features of mrna enable rapid in silico design and the use of automated highthroughput synthesis processes that permit discovery to proceed in parallel rather than sequentially we believe these mrna features can also accelerate drug development by allowing the use of shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure 

4 the ability to leverage shared processes and infrastructure can drive significant capital efficiency over time we believe the manufacturing requirements of different mrna medicines are similar and that at commercial scale a portfolio of mrna medicines will benefit from shared capital expenditures 

our strategy 

we believe that the development of mrna as a new class of medicines as evidenced by the development of mrnabased vaccines during 2020 represents a significant breakthrough for patients and our industry our success in developing a highly effective vaccine against covid19 going from sequence selection conducting clinical trials and to receipt of regulatory authorization for emergency use all in less than a year provides a visible example of the promise of mrnabased medicine the moderna covid19 vaccinespikevax has been authorized for use or approved in over 70 countries in january 2022 the fda approved the bla for spikevax for individuals 18 years of age and older in the united states from the beginning of the pandemic through december 31 2021 we delivered 824 million doses of our vaccine helping to vaccinate millions of people worldwide and combat the pandemic we believe our success in developing this vaccine has positive implications beyond infectious disease vaccines and across our entire pipeline we currently have 44 programs in development and our pipeline spans five therapeutic areas infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases 

in order to deliver on the full scope of the mrna opportunity and maximize longterm value for patients and investors we have developed four pillars underlying our product strategy that guide our nearterm and longterm goals 

1 continue to advance our covid19 program and bring to market a panrespiratory annual booster vaccine our longterm vision is to develop and seek regulatory approval for a convenient annual singledose booster against as many respiratory viruses as possible mrna vaccines have the ability to combine multiple different antigens into one vaccine we believe a singledose booster would provide significant value to patients and healthcare systems as compliance and convenience would increase and there would be a reduction in vaccine administration costs 

this vision includes a singledose booster vaccine against covid19 seasonal flu and respiratory syncytial virus rsv we are developing vaccines against each of these diseases individually while also pursuing parallel development of combination vaccines we are committed to bringing covid19 booster shots variantspecific if needed to the market until the pandemic is under control we have announced positive phase 1 data for both our flu vaccine mrna1010 and rsv vaccine mrna1345 mrna1010 is preparing for a phase 3 trial to start in 2022 and mrna1345 has started the phase 3 portion of a pivotal phase 23 study we are also exploring agreements with governments around the world to establish local manufacturing capabilities in their countries which would provide those governments with access to these annual vaccines as well as future pandemic preparedness capabilities 

2 bring to market firstinclass vaccines against latent viruses latent viruses such as cytomegalovirus cmv epsteinbarr virus ebv and human immunodeficiency virus hiv cause acute infections and significant longterm effects or sequelae cmv infection is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in children in the us and is a major driver of immune dysfunction with aging including cardiovascular diseases cancer and cognitive impairment ebv infection is a 

major cause of infectious mononucleosis im has been tied to increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis and is associated with certain lymphoproliferative disorders higher risk of developing cancerautoimmune diseases and longcovid untreated hiv infection causes impairment of the immune system leading to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids 

our cmv vaccine mrna1647 is in an ongoing pivotal phase 3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mrna1647 against primary cmv infection in women ages 1640 years our prophylactic ebv vaccine mrna1189 is in an ongoing phase 1 study we have two partnered hiv programs one that is in an ongoing phase 1 study mrna1644 and another that is preparing to enter the clinic mrna1547  in february 2022 we announced two new development candidates against herpes simplex virus hsv and varicellazoster virus vzv both of these candidates are in preclinical development 

3 bring to market therapeutics based on mrnaencoded proteins we believe that mrna medicines have the potential to provide patients with any therapeutic protein including those targeting intracellular or membrane proteins across our therapeutics pipeline we have 15 development programs across four therapeutic areas oncology cardiovascular rare disease and autoimmune diseases 

we have had positive early signals in clinical studies in oncology cardiovascular and rare diseases demonstrating early proofofconcept however we are still waiting to advance these programs through full clinical development and regulatory review as we have done with our covid19 vaccine 

4 expand our portfolio through strategic investments that leverage or enhance our platform as we advance our existing technologies in mrna and lnp delivery as well as our biology expertise we believe we can expand our portfolio through collaborations this strategy includes bringing forward novel nucleic acid editing capabilities through moderna genomics mgx which is our effort to expand the use of our platform to create more innovative drugs to help patients through complex gene editing we are committed to advancing this research responsibly and are working toward identifying the right combinations of technologies that can leverage our platform and lead to further breakthroughs in this area 

in december 2021 we announced a collaboration with metagenomi inc a genetic medicines company with a versatile portfolio of nextgeneration gene editing tools focused on advancing new gene editing systems for in vivo human therapeutic applications in january 2022 we announced a collaboration with carisma therapeutics inc to discover develop and commercialize in vivo engineered chimeric antigen receptor monocyte carm therapeutics for the treatment of cancer 

the strategic principles that guide our approach are 

• we seek to discover and develop a large pipeline in parallel our goal is to address or prevent as many human diseases as our technology talent capital and other resources permit we do so as rapidly as we can understanding both the urgency for patients and the need to be disciplined in our approach 

• we undertake sustained longterm investment in technology creation we aim to improve the performance of mrna medicines in our current modalities and to unlock new modalities through investments within basic and applied science 

• we focus on the pace and scale of our learning we seek to accelerate our progress by solving numerous technical problems in parallel rather than in sequence we make significant investments in digital assets and research infrastructure to accelerate the pace and scale of our learning 

• we integrate across the most critical parts of our value chain mrna is a complex multicomponent system and we believe it demands integration we believe that we must be directly engaged in research drug discovery drug development process and analytical development and manufacturing to accelerate our learning reduce our risk and protect our critical knowhow 

• we forward invest in core enabling capabilities and infrastructure to execute across a broad pipeline we need to invest at risk before we have all the answers our forward investments focus on areas where lead times are long and where early investments can reduce execution risk and accelerate future progress we proactively invested in a dedicated manufacturing facility the moderna technology center mtc in norwood massachusetts to support the anticipated growth of our pipeline and this early investment greatly facilitated our ability to respond to the covid19 pandemic by allowing us to begin production of our vaccine even before we received regulatory authorization for its distribution 

our platform 

overview of our platform 

our mrna “platform” refers to our accumulated knowledge and capabilities in basic and applied sciences there are three key components to our platform mrna delivery and the manufacturing process our platform incorporates advances across all three of these areas as we advance our medicines it is the integration of these components that allows us to make our medicines and we combine different versions of mrna delivery and process into each of our medicines 

there are common features between groups of medicines which we call “modalities” these modalities are the application of our platform – the groupings have common features in mrna or delivery technology or in the process by which they are made this strategy allows us to manage risk across development programs as well as to understand in cases of success where we can rapidly expand and build on success with similar programs 

the primary goal of our platform is to identify new modalities and to expand the utility of our existing modalities programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk each time we add a modality and a new medicine to our portfolio we create a network effect because each incremental program can help us gain additional insight into the other the programs in our pipeline 

we have created seven modalities to date 

• prophylactic vaccines 

• systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics 

• cancer vaccines 

• intratumoral immunooncology 

• localized regenerative therapeutics 

• systemic intracellular therapeutics 

• inhaled pulmonary therapeutics 

our platform mrna science advancements 

we continue to invest in both basic and applied research seeking to advance both the state of our technology and the state of the scientific community’s understanding of mrna examples of advances in mrna science that combine nucleotide chemistry sequence engineering and targeting elements are described below 

mrna chemistry modified nucleotides to mitigate immune system activation the innate immune system has evolved to protect cells from foreign rna such as viral rna by inducing inflammation and suppressing mrna translation once detected many cells surveil their environment through sensors called tolllikereceptors tlrs these include types that are activated by the presence of doublestranded rna tlr3 or uridine containing rna fragments tlr7 tlr8 additionally all cells have cytosolic doublestranded rna sensors including retinoic acid inducible genei rigi that are sensitive to foreign rna inside the cell 

the immune and cellular response to mrna is complex context specific and often linked to the sensing of uridine to minimize undesired immune responses to our potential mrna medicines our platform employs chemicallymodified uridine nucleotides to minimize recognition by both immune cell sensors such as tlr378 and broadlydistributed cytosolic receptors such as rigi 

mrna sequence engineering maximizing protein expression mrna exists transiently in the cytoplasm during which time it can be translated into thousands of proteins before eventually being degraded our platform applies bioinformatic biochemical and biological screening capabilities most of which have been invented internally that aim to optimize the amount of protein produced per mrna we have identified proprietary sequences for the 5’utr that have been observed to increase the likelihood that a ribosome bound to the 5’end of the mrna transcript will find the desired start codon and reliably initiate translation of the coding region we additionally design the nucleotide sequence of the coding region to maximize its successful translation into protein 

targeting elements enabling tissuetargeted translation all nucleated cells in the body are capable of translating mrna resulting in pharmacologic activity in any cell in which mrna is delivered and translated to minimize or prevent potential offtarget effects our platform employs technologies that regulate mrna translation in select cell types cells often contain short rna sequences called micrornas or mirnas that bind to mrna to regulate protein translation at the mrna level different cell types have different concentrations of specific micrornas in effect giving cells a microrna signature microrna binding directly to mrna effectively silences or reduces mrna translation and promotes mrna degradation we design microrna binding sites into the 3’utr of our potential mrna medicines so that if our mrna is delivered to cells with such micrornas it will be minimally translated and rapidly degraded 

our platform delivery science 

our mrna can in specific instances such as our vegf therapeutic be delivered by direct injection to a tissue in a simple saline formulation without lnps to locally produce small amounts of pharmacologically active protein however the blood and interstitial fluids in humans contain significant rna degrading enzymes that rapidly degrade any extracellular mrna and prevent broader distribution without lnps additionally cell membranes tend to act as a significant barrier to entry of large negativelycharged molecules such as mrna we have therefore invested heavily in delivery science and have developed lnp technologies to enable delivery of larger quantities of mrna to target tissues 

lnps are generally composed of four components an amino lipid a phospholipid cholesterol and a pegylatedlipid peglipid each component as well as the overall composition or mix of components contributes to the properties of each lnp system lnps containing mrna injected into the body rapidly bind proteins that can drive uptake of lnps into cells once internalized in endosomes within cells the lnps are designed to escape the endosome and release their mrna cargo into the cell cytoplasm where the mrna can be translated to make a protein and have the desired therapeutic effect any mrna and lnp components that do not escape the endosome are typically delivered to lysosomes where they are degraded by the natural process of cellular digestion examples of tools we developed by using our platform include proprietary lnp formulations that address the steps of mrna delivery including cell uptake endosomal escape and subsequent lipid metabolism and for avoidance of counterproductive interactions with the immune system 

chemistry novel lipid chemistry to potentially improve safety and tolerability we initially used lnp formulations that were based on known lipid systems which we refer to as “legacy lnps” a recognized limitation of these legacy lnps is the potential for inflammatory reactions upon single and repeat administration that can impact tolerability and therapeutic index our laterdeveloped proprietary lnp systems are therefore designed to be highly tolerated and minimize any lnp vehiclerelated toxicities with repeat administration in vivo  the changes we made have included engineering amino lipids to avoid the immune system and to be rapidly biodegradable relative to prior lipids 

composition proprietary lnps enhance delivery efficiency our platform includes extensive inhouse expertise in medicinal chemistry which we have applied to design large libraries of novel lipids using these libraries in combination with our discovery biology capabilities we have conducted high throughput screens for desired lnp properties and believe that we have made fundamental discoveries in preclinical studies about the relationships between structural motifs of lipids and lnp performance for protein expression 

surface properties novel lnp design to avoid immune recognition we have designed our proprietary lnp systems for sustained pharmacology upon repeat dosing by eliminating or altering features that activate the immune system these are based on insights into the surface properties of lnps upon repeated dosing surface features on traditional lnps such as amino lipids phospholipids and peglipids can be recognized by the immune system leading to rapid clearance from the bloodstream a decrease in potency upon repeat dosing and an increase in inflammation based on our insights into these mechanisms we have engineered our lnp systems to reduce or eliminate undesirable surface features in preclinical studies in nonhuman primates for our systemic therapeutic development candidates that use our novel lnp systems we have been able to repeat dose with negligible or undetectable loss in potency liver damage and immune system activation 

our platform manufacturing process science 

we invest significantly in manufacturing process science to impart more potent features to our mrna and lnps and to invent the technological capabilities necessary to manufacture our mrna medicines at scales ranging from micrograms to kilograms as well as achieve pharmaceutical properties such as solubility and shelf life we view developing these goals of manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties as appropriate for each program based on its stage of development 

mrna manufacturing process improving pharmacology our platform creates mrna using a cellfree approach called in vitro transcription in which an rna polymerase enzyme binds to and transcribes a dna template adding the nucleotides encoded by the dna to the growing rna strand following transcription we employ proprietary purification techniques to ensure that our mrna is free from undesired synthesis components and impurities that could activate the immune system in an indiscriminate manner applying our understanding of the basic science underlying each step in the manufacturing process we have designed proprietary manufacturing processes to impart desirable pharmacologic features for example increasing potency in a vaccine 

lnp manufacturing process improving pharmacology our platform technology includes synthetic processes to produce lnps traditionally lnps are assembled by dissolving the four molecular components amino lipid phospholipid cholesterol and peglipid in ethanol and then mixing this with mrna in an aqueous buffer the resulting mixture is then purified to isolate lnps from impurities such impurities include molecular components that have not been incorporated into particles unencapsulated mrna that could activate the immune system and particles outside of the desired size range going beyond optimization of traditional manufacturing processes we have invested in understanding and measuring the various biochemical and physical interactions during lnp assembly and purification we have additionally developed stateoftheart analytical techniques necessary to characterize our lnps and biological systems to analyze their in vitro and in vivo performance with these insights we have identified manufacturing process parameters that drive lnp performance for example the potency in a secreted therapeutic setting these insights have allowed us to make significant improvements in the efficiency of our processing and the potency of our lnps 

manufacturing facilities and scale one of the key aspects of our mrna platform is that a single manufacturing facility can be used to manufacture any of our mrna medicines in 2016 following positive phase 1 data we decided to build our clinical manufacturing site in norwood massachusetts this facility produces not only mrna medicines for all of our preclinical experiments and clinical trials but has also produced millions of doses of our covid19 vaccine for commercial use we have also partnered with lonza and additional contract manufacturing organizations cmos to scale up our manufacturing capabilities globally in an effort to combat the covid19 pandemic we are currently working with governments in different geographies to build additional manufacturing facilities with a view toward being able to combat future pandemics 

demonstrations of our platform 

since our founding in 2010 we have made considerable advancements across our platform several examples are described below 

dosedependent protein expression in the clinic we have demonstrated in the clinic the ability to generate consistent dose dependent levels of protein antibodies as well as the ability to safely repeat dose for example we demonstrated the ability to safely repeat dosing in the phase 1 study of our chikungunya antibody program mrna1944 which demonstrated dosedependent increases in levels of antibodies against chikungunya 

reproducible pharmacology including upon repeated dosing by combining advances in mrna delivery and manufacturing process science we have demonstrated in preclinical studies sustained and reproducible pharmacology an example is seen in a mouse model that recapitulates metabolic defects in propionic acidemia pa in this rare disease a defect in one or both of two different subunits pcca and pccb of the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase results in accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 2methylcitrate 2mc in mice hypomorphic for the pcca subunit monthly intravenous iv administration of mrnas encoding pcca and pccb formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna3927 resulted in a significant and sustained lowering of 2mc throughout the duration of the 6month study compared to control luciferase mrna 1 mgkg n6group 

decreased immune activation upon repeat dosing in nonhuman primates we have observed decreased immune activation which enables repeat dosing in nonhuman primates published data indicates serum concentration of human erythropoietin hepo with repeat dosing of mrna encoding hepo in our proprietary lnps with weekly iv administration at 02 mgkg in nonhuman primates 

pharmacologic activity in the target tissue and cell while some of our modalities such as systemic secreted therapeutics can leverage many different cell types to make therapeutic proteins others such as systemic intracellular therapeutics may require delivery of our mrna into specific tissues and cell types for instance hepatocytes in certain liver metabolic diseases combining our proprietary mrna delivery and manufacturing process technologies we have observed ontarget pharmacologic activity in hepatocytes in nonhuman primates the ontarget potency of this approach contrasts with traditional delivery technologies in published data we have shown one of our proprietary lnps with increased hepatocyte transfecting properties result in protein expression in liver hepatocytes in nonhuman primates demonstrated with a reporter protein detected by immunohistochemistry at 6 hours after iv infusion at 2 mgkg additionally this lnp results in extended expression of a secreted reporter protein in nonhuman primates as compared to one of our other proprietary lnps after iv delivery at 01mgkg 

our platform’s future improving and expanding our modalities 

we are committed to sustaining investment in our platform both in basic science to elucidate new mechanistic insights and in applied science to discover new technologies that harness these insights our platform investments have enabled seven modalities to date most of which have already led to multiple development candidates and investigational medicines in our pipeline we believe that sustaining our investment in platform research and development will enable further improvements in the current modalities and will lead to the creation of new modalities both of which will benefit our clinical pipeline in the years ahead 

our modalities 

our approach to developing modalities 

within our platform we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features we call that group a “ modality ” while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases they share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals as well as pharmaceutical properties 

illustrating our approach from our first modality to today 

we started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality because we believed this modality faced lower technical hurdles relative to other areas our early formulations of mrna tended to stimulate the immune system which would present a challenge to therapeutics but was a desired feature for vaccines in addition many potential prophylactic vaccine antigens are wellcharacterized allowing us to reduce biology risk lastly the dosing regimens for vaccines require as few as one or two administrations and generally involve relatively low doses 

for our first programs in this modality we chose our h10n8 and h7n9 pandemic influenza vaccines each requiring expression of a single membrane protein we chose to pursue two programs in separate but parallel clinical trials to establish the flexibility of our platform when both programs met our goals for safety tolerability and pharmacology we accelerated and expanded our vaccine pipeline to include multiple commercially meaningful and increasingly complex vaccines 

these included a combination vaccine designed to protect against two unrelated respiratory viruses human metapneumovirus hmpv and human parainfluenza 3 piv3 and a vaccine that combines six different mrnas our cmv vaccine to express a complex pentameric antigen we also sought strategic alliances with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the biomedical advanced research development authority barda and merck  co merck to allow us to rapidly expand our pipeline and complement our capabilities with their expertise this early work in the prophylactic vaccines modality led to the ability to introduce our covid19 vaccine during 2020 in response to the ongoing pandemic 

over time we have taken on more challenging applications and technological hurdles with each successive modality but we have also tried to build upon our prior experiences to manage risk for example in our cancer vaccines modality we are now applying our technology to elicit t cell responses to potentially recognize and eradicate cancer as a logical extension of our prophylactic vaccines modality having demonstrated local expression of protein in our vaccines we expanded into local therapeutic applications for example in our intratumoral immunooncology modality we are seeking to use local expression to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming tumor microenvironments we can also use local expression to drive regenerative processes as in our vascular endothelial growth factor a vegfa program we expanded into two new modalities that use systemic delivery of mrna to encode secreted and cell surface or intracellular proteins most recently following a breakthrough in pulmonary delivery stemming from our partnership with vertex pharmaceuticals vertex we expanded into the inhaled pulmonary therapeutics modality with our cystic fibrosis cf program 

expanding within our designated core modalities 

in 2020 we designated the prophylactic vaccines and systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modalities as “core modalities” following positive phase 1 data from our cmv vaccine and chikungunya antibody program respectively we believed that this data reduced the risk of these modalities and our strategy is to invest in additional development candidates within these modalities 

we believe our portfolio of modalities—each with distinct technological and biological risk profiles—allows us to maximize longterm value for patients and investors we see our seven current modalities as seven distinct product pipelines that represent different risk profiles and benefit from common infrastructure and a shared platform technology we believe the high technology correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of the pipeline in that modality based on learnings from the initial programs we believe the lower technology correlation between modalities allows us to compartmentalize the technology risks we believe our ongoing investments in our platform will lead to the identification of additional new modalities in the future and will expand the diversity of our pipeline 

modality descriptions 

we currently have seven modalities described in more detail below 

• prophylactic vaccines  the goal of any vaccine is to safely preexpose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen called an antigen so that the immune system is prepared to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future and prevent infection or disease 

we believe mrna vaccines have several advantages 1 ability to mimic many aspects of natural viral infections 2 multiplexing of mrna for more compelling product profiles 3 rapid discovery and advancement of mrna programs into the clinic and 4 capital efficiency and speed from shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure 

• cancer vaccines the goal of a cancer vaccine is to safely expose the patient’s immune system to tumor related antigens known as neoantigens to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique to a patient or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor t cell therapies have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens 

we believe that mrna technology is an attractive approach for cancer vaccines 1 mrna vaccines can deliver multiple neoantigens concatenated in a single mrna molecule 2 mrna encoding for neoantigens is translated and processed by patients’ endogenous cellular mechanisms for presentation to the immune system and 3 mrna vaccines can be efficiently personalized 

• intratumoral immunooncology the goal of this modality is to treat or cure cancer by transforming the tumor microenvironment to drive anticancer t cell responses against tumors the outlook for any patients with advanced cancer remains poor especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement sometimes termed immunologically “cold” in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor we aim to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors intratumoral administration allows for localized effect of these therapeutics that could be toxic if administered systemically 

we believe our approach to immunooncology using mrna medicines could complement checkpoint inhibitors and has several advantages over recombinant proteinbased drugs 1 mrna focuses and limits exposure of immune stimulatory proteins 2 mrna can produce membrane associated immune stimulatory proteins 3 multiplexing of mrna allows access to multiple immune stimulatory pathways 4 mrna sequences can be engineered to reduce offtarget effects and 5 local administration of mrna can create a concentration gradient for encoded proteins 

• localized regenerative therapeutics the goal of this modality is to develop mrna medicines to address injured or diseased tissues by locally producing proteins that provide a therapeutic benefit in the targeted tissue there are multiple applications for tissue regeneration and our initial focus is on cardiovascular diseases 

we believe our approach to localized regenerative therapeutics using mrna has several advantages over alternative approaches 1 mrna can be administered locally to produce the desired protein for an extended duration 2 local administration of mrna allows for focused activity and 3 mrna allows for dosedependent and repeated production of the encoded protein 

• systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics the goal of this modality is to provide secreted proteins such as antibodies or enzyme replacement therapies across a wide range of diseases such as heart failure infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases our mrna medicines instruct various cells of the human body to secrete proteins for therapeutic effect systemically delivered secreted and cell surface therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins 

our potential advantages in this area include 1 mrna can produce hardtomake or complex secreted proteins 2 mrna can produce membrane associated proteins 3 native posttranslational modifications are possible through intracellular protein production using mrna 4 mrna can sustain production of proteins which can increase exposure to proteins with short halflives and 5 mrna allows for desirable pharmacology in rare genetic diseases currently addressed by enzyme replacement therapies 

• systemic intracellular therapeutics the goal of this modality is to provide intracellular proteins such as intracellular enzymes and organellespecific proteins as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies our mrna medicines aim to increase levels of intracellular proteins to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types and our initial focus is on rare genetic diseases intracellular therapeutics are not currently addressable with recombinant proteins which are typically administered systematically and cannot reach inside of the cell 

our potential advantages in these areas include 1 using mrna to encode for intracellular and organellespecific proteins mrna can produce hardtomake or complex proteins 2 native posttranslational modifications are possible through intracellular protein production using mrna 3 mrna can sustain production of proteins which can increase exposure to proteins with short halflives and 4 mrna allows for desirable pharmacology in complex metabolic diseases 

• inhaled pulmonary therapeutics the goal of this modality is to develop mrna medicines that can be delivered to the lung as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies we are developing nebulized nlp formulations that can transfect airway epithelial cells to deliver mrna into the lungs of patients in order to express proteins coded in the mrna we aim to leverage our technology for pulmonary diseases in patients for whom there are no existing effective therapies 

our potential advantages in these areas include 1 mrna can produce hardtomake or complex proteins 2 mrna can replace defective genes and 3 lnp delivery allows for repeat dosing 

our pipeline 

since we nominated our first program in late 2014 we and our strategic collaborators have advanced in parallel a diverse development pipeline which currently consists of 44 development program across our 41 development candidates with 25 having entered the clinic and one development candidate subject to an open investigational new drug application ind in the third quarter of 2021 we refined the way we track our development programs and now separately track each indication of our covid19 and rsv vaccine candidates which resulted in an increase in the number of our development programs we have entered seven other development candidates into the clinic that are no longer being pursued for further clinical development aspects of our pipeline have been supported through strategic alliances including with astrazeneca merck and vertex and governmentsponsored organizations and private foundations focused on global health initiatives including barda darpa the national institutes of health nih and the bill  melinda gates foundation 

our selection process for advancing new development candidates reflects both programspecific considerations as well as portfoliowide considerations programspecific criteria include among other relevant factors the severity of the unmet medical need the biology risk of our chosen target or disease the feasibility of clinical development the costs of development and the commercial opportunity portfoliowide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform components within a modality thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs in the modality and in some cases in other modalities 

the breadth of biology addressable using mrna technology is reflected in our current development pipeline of 44 programs the diversity of proteins made from mrna within our development pipeline is shown in the figure below 

our full pipeline grouped by modalities is shown in the figure below 

prophylactic vaccines modality 

we have 29 different prophylactic vaccine programs of which 17 have entered the clinic we separate our prophylactic vaccines modality into three categories 1 vaccines against respiratory viruses 2 vaccines against latent viruses and 3 other vaccines such as public health programs 

prophylactic vaccines vaccines against respiratory viruses 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 

moderna’s covid19 vaccinespikevax is approved or authorized for use in more than 70 countries 

the moderna covid19 vaccine which is also marketed under the brand name spikevax is our first commercial product from the beginning of the covid19 pandemic through december 31 2021 we delivered approximately 824 million doses of our vaccine globally with approximately 807 million of those doses shipped in 2021 

coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals or humans in humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections these coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and covid19 sarscov2 is the novel coronavirus first identified in humans in december 2019 and is the cause of covid19 covid19 is the most severe global pandemic since the influenza pandemic of 1918 according to the johns hopkins coronavirus resource center since the identification of sarscov2 in 2020 there have been over 430 million confirmed cases and over 59 million global deaths from covid19 the risk of mortality increases with age and the risk of severe disease and mortality increase for persons with preexisting diseases or comorbid conditions eg cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic lung disease obesity 

our vaccine against covid19 mrna1273 was designed subject to phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials delivered clinical trial results and received emergency use and other conditional authorizations in less than a year and has been and continues to be a key tool in fighting the global covid19 pandemic the sarscov2 virus continues to evolve and certain variants of the virus have proven to be more transmissible and to cause more severe cases of covid19 than the ancestral strain that first emerged in wuhan china as part of our strategy to combat the covid19 pandemic we have continued to develop and assess variantspecific versions of our covid19 vaccine including versions aimed at targeting the beta delta and omicron variants of the virus forwardlooking references to our covid19 vaccine in this annual report on form 10k may include future modifications to mrna1273 or other development candidates that are designed to provide protection against variants of the sarscov2 virus 

we continue to study the use of our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 in adolescent and pediatric populations and for boosting and other indications in addition to our original covid19 vaccine we have advanced multiple other variantspecific vaccines into the clinic as part of effort to fight the global covid19 pandemic as of the date of this annual report on form 10k these programs include

moderna covid19 vaccine clinical trials 

the final analysis of adjudicated cases from the phase 3 clinical trial for mrna1273 which we refer to as the cove study demonstrated efficacy of 93 through six months after the second dose of the vaccine the final analysis also demonstrated greater than 98 efficacy against severe cases of covid19 and 100 efficacy against death caused by covid19 in the per protocol cohort the final analysis also demonstrated consistency in our subgroup analysis including analyses by gender by race and by preexisting medical conditions the safety profile for mrna1273 continues to be consistent with the phase 3 data over the longer period of safety follow up and across population subgroups 

variantspecific and multivalent vaccines and omicron update 

we are continuously advancing booster candidates to address emerging variants of concern vocs the strategy involves evaluating the prototype vaccine mrna1273 at the authorized booster dose 50 µg an omicronspecific booster candidate mrna1273529 and a bivalent booster candidate mrna1273214 combining mrna1273529 and mrna1273 booster candidates are being evaluated in ongoing phase 23 studies of approximately 300600 participants per arm in december 2021 we announced that at day 29 postboost the authorized 50 µg booster of mrna1273 increased neutralizing geometric mean titers gmt against omicron approximately 37fold higher than preboost levels at day 29 postboost the 100 µg dose booster of mrna1273 increased neutralizing gmts approximately 83fold higher than preboost levels multivalent candidates mrna1273211 and mrna1273213 boosted omicron specific neutralizing antibody levels to similarly high levels at both the 50 µg and 100 µg levels based on the strength of neutralizing titers generated by mrna1273 the rapid pace of omicron expansion and the increased complexity of deploying a new vaccine we are focusing our nearterm efforts to address omicron on the mrna1273 booster 

however given the longterm threat demonstrated by omicron’s immune escape we are also developing an omicron containing variant vaccine mrna1273529 and a bivalent vaccine that is tailored to omicron and the wildtype virus mrna1273214 the first participant was dosed in the mrna1273529 trial in january 2022 and this trial is ongoing 

covid19 commercial manufacturing and supply updates 

commercial sales of our covid19 vaccine accounted for 177 billion in revenues for the year ended december 31 2021 based upon the delivery of approximately 807 million doses of the vaccine accounting for all of our commercial revenues we anticipate that sales of our covid19 vaccine in 2022 will similarly provide all of our commercial revenues for the coming year these sales both for 2021 and 2022 have been and will primarily be made to governments and international organizations engaged in the purchase of vaccines to combat the covid19 pandemic we are preparing for the fall 2022 booster season and if marketing approval is received for boosters of our covid19 vaccine we expect to initiate sales in the us private market as the covid19 pandemic evolves into an endemic phase we anticipate greater seasonality for sales with greater demand in the fallwinter season in each hemisphere as countries seek to boost their populations for further information on the sales and manufacturing of our covid19 vaccine see “manufacturing” and “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” below 

seasonal influenza vaccine mrna1010 mrna1011 mrna1012 mrna1020 and mrna1030 

we are developing five influenza vaccines mrna1010 has reported positive phase 1 data and is ongoing in a phase 2 study and a phase 3 study is planned to start soon 

seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by the world health organization who to cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650000 deaths each year resulting in a severe challenge to public health currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60 overall effectiveness and can provide low effectiveness during years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains selected for the vaccine antigens our mrna seasonal influenza vaccine program has three different approaches our first approach – quadrivalent vaccine – is developing a quadrivalent seasonal flu vaccine mrna1010 targeting who recommendations including a h1n1 h3n2 and influenza b yamagata and victoria lineages our second approach – expanded coverage – is to provide an enhanced antigen selection opportunity to public health authorities with the potential for regional variation our third approach – immunologic breadth – is to provide immunity by targeting more conserved antigens to provide the broadest coverage we also aim to work with the who and other regulators to make vaccines closer to the flu season and potentially choose strains closer to the ones circulating in the hemisphere 

mrna1010 is a single investigational vaccine consisting of four distinct mrna sequences that encode the a h1n1 h3n2 and influenza b yamagata and victoria lineages in our proprietary lnp mrna1011 and mrna1012 are investigational vaccines that will include the four who recommended strains and aim to add additional hemagglutinin ha antigens eg h3n2 h1n1 mrna1020 and mrna1030 are investigational vaccines that will aim to add neuraminidase na antigens 

latest data and next steps 

mrna1010 is ongoing in a phase 2 study and a phase 3 efficacy study is planned to start in 2022 in december 2021 we announced positive phase 1 data and that mrna1010 successfully boosted hemagglutination inhibition hai assay geometric mean titers against all strains 29 days after vaccination at all doses tested in both younger and older adults in the phase 1 study mrna1010 was evaluated at 50 µg 100 µg and 200 µg dose levels in younger adult age 1849 and older adult age 50 cohorts no significant safety findings were observed through day 29 adverse reactions ars were generally reported more frequently in younger adults compared to older adults and at higher dose levels minimal differences in dose response was observed between the 50 µg 100 µg and 200 µg dose levels suggesting the potential to explore even lower doses 

our expanded coverage influenza vaccines mrna1011  mrna1012 and immunologic breadth influenza vaccines mrna1020  mrna1030 are in preclinical studies 

rsv vaccine mrna1345 

we are developing an rsv vaccine for children and older adults in older adults mrna1345 is ongoing in a pivotal phase 3 study in pediatrics mrna1345 is ongoing in a phase 1 study 

respiratory syncytial virus rsv is one of the most common causes of respiratory disease in children under the age of five and also in older adults most children are infected at least once by two years of age in the united states it is estimated that over two million children younger than five years of age receive medical attention and more than 86000 are hospitalized due to rsv infection annually rsv also causes a substantial burden of respiratory illness in older adults rsv infection causes an estimated 17700 hospitalizations and 14000 deaths per year in adults aged 65 years in the united states 

mrna1345 encodes an engineered form of the rsv f protein stabilized in the prefusion conformation and is formulated in our proprietary lnp we believe that neutralizing antibodies elicited by mrna1345 may lead to an efficacious rsv vaccine 

latest data and next steps 

the phase 1 study of mrna1345 to evaluate the tolerability reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mrna1345 in younger adults older adults older adults of japanese descent women of childbearing age and children with serologic evidence of prior rsv exposure is ongoing the age range of children in this deescalation phase 1 study is 1259 months enrollment in the pediatric and older adult japanese descent cohorts are ongoing whereas the other cohorts are fully enrolled phase 1 interim data from the older adult cohort showed that a single mrna1345 vaccination at 50 µg 100 µg or 200 µg boosted neutralizing antibody titers against rsva by approximately 14fold and against rsvb by approximately 10fold 

the phase 3 portion of the pivotal global phase 23 study of mrna1345 with approximately 34000 participants and testing the 50 µg is currently enrolling the fda has granted fast track designation for mrna1345 in adults older than 60 years of age 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 

we are developing a combination vaccine to address two viruses that are leading causes of respiratory infection 

human metapneumovirus hmpv and human parainfluenza virus 3 piv3 are significant causes of respiratory tract infections in children hmpv has been detected in 4 to 15 of patients with acute respiratory infections hmpv causes disease primarily in young children but can also infect adults the elderly and immunocompromised individuals infections from parainfluenza virus piv account for up to 7 of acute respiratory infections among children younger than 5 years of the four piv types identified piv3 most frequently results in infections and leads to the more serious lower respiratory tract infections compared to the other three piv types 

mrna1653 is a single investigational vaccine consisting of two distinct mrna sequences that encode the membrane f proteins of hmpv and piv3 coformulated in our proprietary lnp 

latest data and next steps 

a firstinhuman doseranging study mrna1653p101 in healthy adults n124 was completed in january 2020 this study evaluated the safety reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a range of dose levels 25 75 150 or 300 µg administered on a 1dose or 2dose vaccination schedule approximately 28 days apart compared with a placebo control in healthy adult subjects 18 through 49 years of age with a 13 month followup period the mrna1653 vaccine was generally welltolerated at all dose levels a single dose of mrna1653 boosted serum neutralization titers against hmpv and piv3 and the magnitude of the boost was similar at all dose levels the month 1 to baseline geometric mean ratio gmr for the pooled mrna1653 treatment groups was approximately 6 for hmpv and 3 for piv3 a second vaccination did not impact the magnitude of hmpv or piv3 neutralization titers measured at month 2 the hmpv neutralizing antibody titers remained above baseline at all dose levels through month 13 and the piv3 neutralizing antibody titers remained above baseline at all dose levels through month 7 

we are conducting a phase 1b trial to evaluate mrna1653 in healthy adults and children aged 1259 months the phase 1b trial is a randomized observerblinded placebocontrolled doseranging trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of mrna1653 in healthy adults 1849 years of age and two dose levels in children 1259 months of age with serologic evidence of prior hmpv and piv3 exposure the study is fully enrolled 

combination vaccines mrna1073  mrna1365 

our vision is to develop a panrespiratory annual booster vaccine mrna1073 and a pediatric combination vaccine mrna1365 

in september 2021 we announced two development candidates that build upon our combination strategy mrna1073 is our covid19 and seasonal flu combination vaccine mrna1073 encodes for the covid19 spike protein and the flu ha glycoproteins mrna1365 is our pediatric rsv and hmpv combination vaccine mrna1365 encodes for the rsv prefusion f glycoprotein and the hmpv f protein 

prophylactic vaccines vaccines against latent viruses 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 

our cmv program targets prevention of cmv infections which could reduce the risk of birth defects 

human cmv is a common human pathogen and member of the herpes virus family congenital cmv results from infected mothers transmitting the virus to their unborn child and it is the leading infectious cause of birth defects in the united states with approximately 25000 newborns in the us infected annually there is currently no available vaccine for cmv and a vaccine that leads to durable immunity in women of childbearing age would address a critical unmet need in the prevention of congenital cmv infection 

our cmv vaccine mrna1647 combines six mrnas in one vaccine which encode for two proteins located on the surface of cmv five mrnas encoding the subunits that form the membranebound pentamer complex and one mrna encoding the fulllength membranebound glycoprotein b gb both the pentamer and gb are essential for cmv to infect barrier epithelial surfaces and gain access to the body which is the first step in cmv infection mrna1647 is designed to produce an immune response against both the pentamer and gb for the prevention of cmv infection 

latest data and next steps 

phase 1 and 2 studies of mrna1647 demonstrated functional antigenspecific responses that support the vaccine candidate’s potential to prevent cmv infection interim sevenmonth data from the phase 2 study of mrna1647 at the 50 μg 100 μg and 150 μg dose levels showed that mrna1647 was generally well tolerated in cmvseronegative participants in mrna1647 treatment groups after the third vaccination neutralizing antibody gmts against epithelial cell infection were at least 20fold higher than the baseline gmt of the cmv seropositive group and neutralizing antibody gmts against fibroblast infection approximated the baseline 

gmt of the cmvseropositive group in cmv positive participants in mrna1647 treatment groups after the third vaccination neutralizing antibody gmts against epithelial cell infection increased to at least 68fold over baseline and neutralizing antibody gmts against fibroblast infection increased to approximately 2fold over baseline 

based on the interim analysis of the phase 2 study the 100 μg dose was chosen for the phase 3 study the first participant in the phase 3 study known as cmvictory was dosed in october 2021 the study is evaluating the safety and efficacy of mrna1647 against primary cmv infection in women ages 1640 years and seeks to enroll 6900 women of childbearing age 

ebv vaccine mrna1189  mrna1195 

we are developing two ebv vaccines – a vaccine to prevent infectious mononucleosis and another vaccine to prevent the longer term sequelae of ebv infection 

epsteinbarr virus ebv a member of the herpesvirus family that includes cmv infects approximately 90 of people by adulthood with primary infection typically occurring during childhood or late adolescence approximately 50 and 89 seropositivity respectively in the us ebv is the major cause of infectious mononucleosis in the us accounting for over 90 of the approximately 12 million cases of infectious mononucleosis in the us each year infectious mononucleosis can debilitate patients for weeks to months and in some cases can lead to hospitalization and splenic rupture ebv infection is associated with the development and progression of certain lymphoproliferative disorders cancers and autoimmune diseases in particular ebv infection and infectious mononucleosis are associated with increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system 

similar to our cmv vaccine mrna1647 product concept we believe that an effective ebv vaccine must generate an immune response to antigens that are required for viral entry in most of the susceptible cell types we have thus designed our ebv vaccine mrna1189 to elicit an immune response to ebv envelope glycoproteins gp220 as well as gp42 and the ghgl complex which are required for infection of both epithelial and b cells mrna1189 contains four mrnas encoding for these proteins encapsulated in our proprietary lnps mrna1195 encodes for additional antigens and the first indication it will focus on is posttransplant lymphoproliferative diseases 80 of ptld can be attributed to ebv 

latest data and next steps 

we are conducting a phase 1 randomized observerblind placebocontrolled study of mrna1189 the primary purpose of the phase 1 study is to assess safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna1189 in healthy adults ages 18 to 30 we announced the dosing of the first participant in january 2022 and we expect to enroll approximately 270 participants our ebv therapeutic vaccine mrna1195 is in preclinical studies 

hsv vaccine mrna1608 

we are developing a herpes simplex virus hsv vaccine candidate against hsv2 disease 

herpes simplex viruses commonly known as herpes are categorized into two types hsv1 infects the mouth face and genitals and hsv2 primarily infects the genitals both viruses establish lifelong latent infections within nearby sensory neurons from which they can reactivate and reinfect the skin there is a significant burden of disease from hsv genital infections diagnosed symptomatic genital herpes causes a reduction in quality of life which antivirals current standard of care only partially restore in the united states approximately 186 million adults ages 18 to 49 years are living with hsv2 globally approximately 5 of the population in the 18to49year age range is hsv2 seropositive 

we believe that an hsv vaccine could deliver similar efficacy as suppressive antiviral treatments and could improve compliance and quality of life we aim to induce a strong antibody response with neutralizing and effector functionality combined with cellmediated immunity 

latest data and next steps 

our hsv vaccine mrna1608 is currently in preclinical studies in a preclinical study in mice we demonstrated robust neutralizing response induced by an mrna vaccine containing hsv2 antigens against both hsv2 infection and crossneutralization against hsv1 infection in addition the sera also demonstrated high antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity adcc activity the immune responses induced by the hsv2 mrna vaccine are higher than the average observed in 80 randomly selected seropositive human sera 

vzv vaccine mrna1468 

we are developing a varicellazoster virus vzv vaccine candidate to reduce the rate of herpes zoster shingles 

herpes zoster occurs in one of three adults in their lifetime and incidence dramatically increases at approximately 50 years of age declining immunity in older adults decreases cellmediated immunity against vzv allowing reactivation of the virus from latently infected neurons causing painful and itchy lesions serious herpes zoster complications include postherpetic neuralgia 1013 of herpes zoster cases bacterial coinfections and cranial and peripheral palsies 14 of individuals with herpes zoster cases are hospitalized for complications severity of disease and likelihood of complications including postherpetic neuralgia phn also increases with age immunocompromised patients autoimmune disease patients using immunosuppressive therapies hivinfected patients hematopoietic stem cell hsct and organ transplant recipients have an increased risk of developing herpes zoster the incidence of herpes zoster has been increasing throughout the world from 076 per 1000 person years from 1945 to 1949 to 72 per 1000 person years in 2016 the current standard of care is shingrix tm  an fdaapproved vaccine for the prevention of shingles herpes zoster in adults 50 years and older it is more than 90 effective against herpes zoster in adults aged 5070 with only a slight reduction in efficacy for adults over age 70 

our vzv vaccine mrna1468 is designed to express vzv glycoprotein e ge to reduce the rate of herpes zoster 

latest data and next steps 

in partnership with merck we previously published preclinical data in vaccine showing that an lnp formulated merck’s proprietary lnp mrna encoding vzv ge antigen is highly immunogenic in nonhuman primates our vzv vaccine mrna1468 using our proprietary lnp is currently in preclinical studies 

hiv vaccine mrna1644  mrna1574 

we are developing two hiv vaccines – one approach is to test a novel hiv vaccine strategy in humans for eliciting broadly neutralizing hiv1 antibodies bnabs and the second approach is to test novel hiv trimer designs in humans 

hiv is the virus responsible for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids a lifelong progressive illness with no effective cure approximately 38 million people worldwide are currently living with hiv with 12 million in the us approximately 15 million new infections of hiv are acquired worldwide every year and approximately 680000 people die annually due to complications from hivaids the primary routes of transmission are sexual intercourse and iv drug use putting young adults at the highest risk of infection from 2000 to 2015 a total of 5626 billion globally was spent on care treatment and prevention of hiv representing a significant economic burden 

in collaboration with the international aids vaccine initiative iavi and the bill  melinda gates foundation mrna1644 is testing a novel hiv vaccine strategy in humans as delivered by mrna to elicit broadly neutralizing hiv1 antibodies bnabs through sequential vaccination of novel prime and boost antigens that induce specific bcell responses in collaboration with iavi and the hiv vaccine trials network mrna1574 is testing multiple nativelike hiv trimer mrnas in humans to improve our understanding of how to make stable and immunogenic nativehiv trimers 

latest data and next steps 

mrna1644 is in an ongoing phase 1 clinical trial and mrna1574 is in preclinical studies 

prophylactic vaccines public health vaccines 

zika vaccine mrna1893 

in partnership with barda we are in a phase 2 clinical trial for our zika vaccine 

the zika virus is a single stranded rna virus of the flaviviridae family seroepidemiology data suggest that it is endemic to regions of africa and asia where the aedes mosquito vectors are found zika virus is predominantly spread by mosquitos from the aedes genus but it can also be transmitted congenitally sexually and through blood donation zika infection is usually asymptomatic or mild in adults leading to fever rash and conjunctivitis however infection of women during pregnancy can result in devastating microcephaly in newborns microcephaly is a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head and brain associated with lifelong neurodevelopmental delay seizures intellectual disability balance problems and dwarfism  short stature resulting in significant disability and requiring lifelong support in 2007 a zika infection outbreak progressed across the pacific islands an outbreak observed in brazil in 2015 soon spread across the americas this led to the who declaring it a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 during the period there were tens of thousands of cases of microcephaly and congenital zika syndrome reported in infants and of resulting neurological sequelae such as guillainbarré syndrome reported in adults 

our zika vaccine mrna1893 encodes for the prme structural protein encapsulated in our proprietary lnp 

latest data and next steps 

in 2020 we announced positive data from our phase 1 clinical trial which enrolled four cohorts 10 30 100 and 250 µg mrna1893 was safe and well tolerated at the 10 and 30 µg dose level in the flavivirusseronegative group seroconversion rates after the second vaccination reached 944 at the 10 µg dose level and 100 in the 30 µg dose level prnt 50  in the flavivirusseropositive group the percentage of participants achieving a 4fold boost in preexisting prnt 50 titers after the second vaccination reached 50 in the 10 µg dose level and 75 in the 30 µg dose level prnt 50  we are currently enrolling mrna1893 in a phase 2 clinical study in the united states and puerto rico with approximately 800 participants the randomized placebocontrolled study aims to evaluate the safety tolerability and reactogenicity of mrna1893 compared to placebo 

nipah vaccine mrna1215 

in collaboration with the nihvrc we are preparing to start a phase 1 study for our nipah vaccine 

nipah virus niv is a zoonotic virus transmitted to humans from animals contaminated food or through direct humantohuman transmission and causes a range of illnesses including fatal encephalitis severe respiratory and neurologic complications from niv have no treatment other than intensive supportive care the case fatality rate among those infected is estimated at 4075 niv outbreaks cause significant economic burden to impacted regions due to loss of human life and interventions to prevent further spread such as the slaughter of infected animals niv has been identified as the cause of isolated outbreaks in india bangladesh malaysia and singapore since 2000 and is included on the who rd blueprint list of epidemic threats needing urgent rd action 

latest data and next steps 

mrna1215 our vaccine candidate against the nipah virus niv was codeveloped along with the nih’s vaccine research center the phase 1 clinical testing will be focused on pandemic preparedness 

systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality 

our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality currently has three active development programs of which one has entered the clinic we previously announced positive data from our chikungunya antibody program mrna1944 within this modality however we do not expect to advance our chikungunya antibody program without outside funding and we are not currently pursuing further development of it at this time 

il2 mutein mrna6231 

il2 is a critical cytokine for treg activation and expansion and our product utilizes subcutaneous mrna administration to produce a modified version of il2 in order to treat autoimmune diseases 

il2based therapeutics are being clinically evaluated for a wide range of immunemediated disorders including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus graft versus host disease inflammatory bowel diseases and autoimmune hepatitis il2 is a cytokine which are potent modulators of the immune system directing function and homeostasis il2 is critically important to t cell survival and function il2 acts through a receptor complex that can be dimeric il2rß cd122 plus the common γ chain cd132 or trimeric which is formed through the addition of il2rα cd25 to the dimeric form the trimeric form has 10fold to 100fold greater affinity for il2 under low or homeostatic il2 conditions those cells which preferentially express the trimeric receptor or il2r such as tregs and very recently activated effector t cells are activated 

we believe that our platform can be exploited to produce a modified il2 for the treatment of autoimmune conditions our modified il2 is engineered with mutations that selectively decrease binding to the dimeric il2 receptor present on cd4 and cd8 t effector cells and nk cells and increase reliance upon cd25 of the trimeric il2 receptor complex to trigger the signaling cascade in regulatory t cells our modified il2 is also expressed as a fusion protein to extend its halflife in the serum it is also the first demonstration of subcutaneous administration of the delivery technology that was also used our chikungunya antibody therapeutic mrna1944 

latest data and next steps 

mrna6231 is ongoing in a phase 1 clinical study the trial is a phase 1 firstinhuman doseescalation study to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of mrna6231 in healthy adult participants between 1850 years of age following subcutaneous administration of mrna6231 

pdl1 mrna6981 

pdl1 is a coinhibitory receptor that can induce anergy in programmed cell death protein 1 pd1expressing t cells and we intend to induce expression of pdl1 on myeloid cells to send a tolerizing signal to immune cells in their environment in order to treat autoimmune diseases 

the pdl1pd1 pathway has a critical function in immune regulation and promotes development and function of tregs pdl1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages activated t cells b cells and monocytes as well as peripheral tissues its cognate receptor pd1 is a coinhibitory transmembrane protein expressed on t cells b cells natural killer cells and thymocytes preclinical mouse models deficient in pd1 spontaneously develop a variety of autoimmune diseases such as arthritis myocarditis lupuslike glomerulonephritis and type 1 diabetes demonstrating the critical role of the pdl1pd1 interaction in maintaining tolerance to selfantigens additionally treatment of cancer patients with pd1 or pdl1 inhibitors sometimes results in immunerelated adverse events including the development of hepatitis dermatitis and colitis demonstrating the role of pd1pdl1 in human autoimmune reactions 

we believe our pdl1 therapy may augment pdl1 expression on cell types similar to those that endogenously express it and by reducing immune activation potentially reduce the clinical manifestations of a variety of autoimmune diseases our intent is to use our platform to influence myeloid cells including dendritic cells to provide additional coinhibitory signals by augmenting endogenous expression of pdl1 we believe that this tolerizing signal to lymphocytes may limit autoreactivity in the context of ongoing autoimmune pathology without severe and global suppression of the immune system given that our platform allows us to modify myeloid cells in situ  our approach to the creation of a tolerogenic environment may provide unique benefits in treating autoimmune diseases by seeking to restore immune homeostasis 

latest data and next steps 

we have investigated mrna6981 in a range of preclinical models of autoimmune and related diseases including arthritis type 1 diabetes colitis and graftversushost disease and observed diseasemodifying activity we are currently in preclinical studies for mrna6981 

relaxin mrna0184 

relaxin is a vasoactive peptide associated with cardiovascular remodeling and we intend to encode for a relaxin fusion protein to treat decompensated heart failure 

relaxin is a naturally occurring hormone present in both men and women that has been shown to promote vasodilation and angiogenesis regulate extracellular matrix turnover and suppress arrhythmias post myocardial infarction subsequent studies have implicated relaxin’s role beyond pregnancy through vasodilatory antifibrotic antiinflammatory and protective effects on multiple organs relaxin activates a variety of pathways contributing to the reduction of oxidative stress fibrosis and inflammation there is a large body of evidence to support relaxin’s clinical potential in several therapeutic areas with its impact on cardiovascular diseases having been studied in both preclinical and clinical settings though prior studies have failed to demonstrate longterm benefit in clinical studies we believe a novel approach can overcome potential flaws of previous approaches 

mrna0184 is being developed to treat decompensated heart failure acute heart failure ahf is defined as the new onset or worsening of symptoms and signs of heart failure hf in developed countries hf has become a substantial public health problem affecting 2 of the adult population and ahf is the most frequent cause of unplanned hospital admission in patients of 65 years of age mrna0184 encodes for the relaxin fusion protein the mrna sequence of mrna0184 is engineered to increase protein expression and prolong halflife 

latest data and next steps 

in preclinical studies we have shown preliminary protein expression data in nonhuman primates that supports the hypothesis of extended pharmacology relative to historical efforts with recombinant protein we are planning for a phase 1 study in participants with chronic heart failure we expect that mrna0814 will be administered after heart failure decompensation to bridge patients through the vulnerable period 

cancer vaccines modality 

our cancer vaccines modality currently has three development programs two of which have entered the clinic we have regained all rights to our kras vaccine mrna5671 from merck and we are evaluating next steps for the program 

personalized cancer vaccine pcv mrna4157 

pcv encodes for up to 34 neoantigens designed against an individual’s patient tumor mutations and is ongoing in a phase 1 and phase 2 trial across a variety of indications 

as tumors grow they acquire mutations some of which create new protein sequences or neoantigens that can be presented on human leukocyte antigen hla molecules in the tumor and recognized as nonself by t cells these neoantigens can be shared or are completely unique to an individual patient’s tumor in addition to the neoantigens being unique and patient specific the presentation of those neoantigens is also dependent on a patient’s specific hla type identification of patientspecific hla type and tumor neoantigens through next generation sequencing paired with our proprietary in silico design of each patient’s mrna vaccine and rapid manufacturing for a specific patient allows us to rapidly deliver a completely unique and personalized medicine to patients 

our personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 consists of an mrna that encodes up to 34 neoantigens predicted to elicit both class i cd8 and class ii cd4 responses designed against each individual patient’s tumor mutations and specific to their hla type the neoantigens are encoded in a single mrna sequence and formulated in our proprietary lnps designed for intramuscular injection the mrna sequence is then manufactured using an automated workflow to enable a rapid turnaround time 

latest data and next steps 

the phase 1 trial is an openlabel multicenter study to assess the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna4157 alone in subjects with resected solid tumors and in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab marketed in the united states as keytruda® in subjects with resected and unresected solid tumors mrna4157 is administered on the first day of each 21day cycle for a maximum of nine doses mrna4157 is administered as monotherapy part a or in combination with pembrolizumab parts b c and d in the united states studies have shown mrna4157 to be well tolerated at all dose levels the majority of adverse events from mrna4157 have been low grade and reversible encouraging data emerging from an expansion arm in patients with head and neck cancer has recently caused us to increase the size of that cohort which continues to recruit trial participants 

the randomized placebocontrolled phase 2 study is investigating a 1 mg dose of mrna4157 in combination with merck’s pembrolizumab keytruda® compared to pembrolizumab alone for the adjuvant treatment of highrisk resected melanoma this study was fully enrolled n150 in september 2021 and the primary endpoint of the phase 2 study is recurrencefree survival at 12 months 

kras vaccine mrna5671 

the phase 1 study led by merck is ongoing we have retained all rights to our kras vaccine mrna5671 from merck and we are evaluating next steps for the program 

oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell neoantigens have considerable potential therapeutic implications 1 driver mutations are subject to positive selection as they confer survival advantages for the tumor and 2 such neoantigens could be shared between patients enabling an easier approach to developing and manufacturing such therapeutic or curative interventions 

kras is a frequently mutated oncogene in epithelial cancers primarily lung colorectal cancer crc and pancreatic cancers the four most prevalent kras mutations associated with these malignancies are g12d g12v g13d and g12c which constitute 80 to 90 of kras mutations 

latest data and next steps 

the phase 1 openlabel multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna5671 both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab led by merck is ongoing we have retained all rights to our kras vaccine mrna5671 from merck and we are evaluating next steps for the program 

checkpoint cancer vaccine mrna4359 

we are developing a checkpoint cancer vaccine that encodes antigens for indoleamine 23 dioxygenase ido and programmed deathligand 1 pdl1 antigens 

our checkpoint vaccine aims to stimulate effector t cells that target and kill suppressive immune and tumor cells that express ido and pdl1 antigens following vaccinemediated activation ido and pdl1specific t cells kill immunosuppressive regulatory immune cells and cancer cells cancer cell killing and the reduction of regulatory immune cells tip the balance towards productively 

inflammatory immune cells with signaling molecules “heating up” the tumor microenvironment which leads to additional tumor killing by vaccineactivated t cells t cell priming leads to recognition of additional tumorassociated antigens and to more tumor killing by tumorspecific cytotoxic t cells systemic pd1pdl1 blockade may further amplify the effect leading to further immune activation and superior disease control 

our initial indications for our checkpoint vaccine are advanced or metastatic cutaneous melanoma and nonsmall cell lung carcinoma nsclc melanoma is the fifth most common cancer diagnosis in the us it accounts for approximately 5 of all new cancer diagnoses and 15 of all cancerrelated deaths cutaneous melanoma is a cancer that starts in the melanocytes pigmentproducing cells of the skin if diagnosed at the local stage the 5year survival rate is approximately 95 however for regional or metastatic disease stage iiib 5year survival rates decline to approximately 30 to 60 approximately 18000 new patients are diagnosed with stage iiib cutaneous melanoma in the us advanced melanoma a rare and serious type of skin cancer is responsible for most skin cancerrelated deaths despite representing only 1 of skin cancer cases current standard of care pembrolizumab nivolumab or the combination of nivolumab  ipilimumab 

nsclc frequently goes undetected remaining asymptomatic until it has progressed to later stages approximately 115000 people are diagnosed with metastatic nsclc or progress to metastatic disease annually in the united states the current approach to treatment of metastatic nsclc treatment is dependent on the presence of pdl1 expression if tumor pdl1 expression is greater than 50 pembrolizumab or atezolizumab monotherapy are preferred while a combination of chemotherapy and pembrolizumab is preferred for patients with pdl1 expression less than 50 

latest data and next steps 

our checkpoint vaccine is currently in preclinical studies 

intratumoral immunooncology modality 

our intratumoral immunooncology modality currently has two development programs both of which are in the clinic 

ox40lil23il36 γ triplet mrna2752 

triplet includes three mrnas encoding human ox40l interleukin 23 il23 and interleukin 36 gamma il36γ that are encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and administered intratumorally 

despite recent advances in immunemediated therapies for cancer the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer is poor we are developing triplet mrna2752 and other programs to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming cold tumor microenvironments into productive “hotter” immune landscapes with local intratumoral therapies triplet mrna2752 utilizes the intrinsic advantage of mrna to multiplex and to produce membrane and secreted proteins with mrna in a single investigational medicine triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding human ox40l il23 and il36γ that are encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and administered intratumorally ox40l is a membrane protein whereas il23 and il36γ are secreted cytokines we believe our approach has the advantage of localized high concentration gradients of il23 and il36γ compared to recombinant proteins administered systemically or intratumorally additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which we believe recombinant protein technologies cannot enable 

we are developing triplet mrna2752 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma as a single agent or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors 

latest data and next steps 

mrna2752 is ongoing in a phase 1 openlabel multicenter doseescalation study this study is evaluating the safety and tolerability of escalating intratumoral injections of mrna2752 alone and in combination with pdl1 inhibitor durvalumab to define the maximum tolerated dose mtd or a recommended dose for expansion rde the study consists of dose escalation and dose confirmation parts which will occur in arm a and arm b followed by a dose expansion part which will occur in arm b and a dose exploration in arm c as a neoadjuvant therapy for cutaneous melanoma enrollment in the dose expansion part of arm b and arm c is currently ongoing 

we previously announced the interim results of part a in 2020 in 2021 we announced that the phase 1 study demonstrates that triplet given in combination with astrazeneca’s durvalumab imfinzi® was tolerated at all dose levels tested and elicited evidence of antitumor activity the recommended dose for expansion rde is up to of 4mg mrna2752  durvalumab the study also demonstrated evidence of immunomodulation and expected pharmacodynamics in the tumor immune microenvironment tme of both injected and uninjected lesions in both monotherapy and combination cases as indicated by increases in proliferating activated 

t cells pdl1 levels marker of interferon signaling and t cellinflamed gep and dc transcriptional signature score with greatest changes observed in patients with clinical benefit 

il12 medi1191 

in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing a mrna that encodes for il12 encapsulated in our proprietary lnp delivered intratumorally 

another strategy for cancer patients with immunologically cold tumors is to transform the tumor microenvironment by introducing proinflammatory cytokines directly into tumors or draining lymph nodes in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing medi1191 which is an mrna for il12 encapsulated in our proprietary lnp to be delivered intratumorally systemic administration of recombinant il12 protein was poorly tolerated in early clinical trials and exhibited generally low response rates medi1191 can enhance the immune response by positively impacting both antigen presenting cells and t cells and local intratumoral expression of il12 can potentially improve tolerability compared to systemic protein treatments 

medi1191 is being developed for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor medi1191 consists of our proprietary lnp encapsulating an mrna for human il12b p40 and il12a p35 subunits the mrna produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il12a subunits with a linker between the subunits the mrna sequence has been engineered to enhance protein production and is designed to decrease the amount of protein that might be made in hepatocytes for better tolerability 

latest data and next steps 

in preclinical studies treatment with il12 transformed the tumor microenvironment with notable activation of natural killer and dendritic cells and an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes astrazeneca is leading the early clinical development and an openlabel multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral injections of medi1191 alone and in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab is ongoing in 2021 we presented il12 data that show evidence of antitumor activity in injected and noninjected lesions as well as pharmacodynamic effects such as increased il12 interferon gamma ifnγ and 12 and inflammatory transcriptome 

regenerative therapeutics modality 

our regenerative therapeutics modality currently has one development program which is in the clinic 

vegfa azd8601 

in collaboration with astrazeneca vegfa is a localized therapeutic encoding for the vegfa protein and addressing ischemic heart failure 

heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states accounting for one in every four deaths and is often due to the inability of adults to regenerate heart tissue current approved therapies do not specifically address heart regeneration previous attempts at cardiac regeneration have included stem cell grafting and gene therapy but have faced challenges with safety or efficacy several treatments are available for patients with ischemic heart failure current treatments include revascularization of the coronary arteries to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac function and therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate excess fluids in congested tissues including betablockers angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii inhibitors and aldosterone receptor blockers as diuretics however adult humans are unable to regenerate myocardium tissue following injury and the treatment options described above cannot compensate for this 

vascular endothelial growth factor a vegfa is a potent angiogenic factor that promotes growth of blood vessels and acts as a powerful promoter of blood vessel growth systemic injection of vegfa protein increases vegfa exposure throughout the body which can lead to side effects but is very shortlived in circulation therefore any therapy involving vegfa needs to be localized to elevate local protein concentration and drive revascularization while minimizing systemic side effects astrazeneca has opted to pursue the localized application of vegfa mrna in a simple saline formulation in the heart muscle to elevate local protein concentration for longer periods due to increased local protein production this potentially allows for an extended pharmacodynamic effect at the specific site of injection compared to systemic or local administration of a recombinant protein version of vegfa 

latest data and next steps 

preclinical studies have been conducted at astrazeneca in models of ischemic heart failure in mouse rat and pig models of myocardial infarction direct injection in the heart muscle myocardium of vegfa mrna led to elevated cardiac vegfa protein levels and improved cardiac function the phase 1ab study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus conducted in europe vegfa mrna was administered by intradermal injection into the forearm skin in single ascending doses administration of azd8601 demonstrated protein production and changes in local blood flow in diabetic patients tolerability of our mrna injected intradermally was demonstrated for all dose levels the only causally treatmentrelated adverse events were mild injectionsite reactions occurring in 32 of 33 participants receiving vegfa mrna across both parts of the study design all adverse events of injectionsite reaction were of mild intensity no deaths serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred 

astrazeneca has also progressed vegfa azd8601 to a randomized placebocontrolled doubleblind multicenter 6month phase 2a clinical trial of the safety tolerability and exploratory efficacy of epicardial injections of azd8601 in patients with stable coronary artery disease and moderately decreased left ventricular ejection fraction lvef who are undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery exploratory efficacy endpoints included lvef ntprobnp a biomarker which measures the level of a hormone which is elevated in patients with heart failure and functional patient reported outcomes in 2021 the phase 2 study met the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability of azd8601 for the 3 mg dose in the study of 11 patients seven were treated with azd8601 vegfa mrna and four received placebo injections numerical trends were observed in endpoints in the heart failure efficacy domains compared with placebo including increase in lvef and patient reported outcomes in addition all seven patients treated with azd8601 had ntprobnp levels below heart failure hf limit at 6 months followup compared to one of four patients treated with placebo astrazeneca has announced that they intend to move azd8601 into further studies 

systemic intracellular therapeutics 

our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality currently has five development programs two of which are in the clinic 

propionic acidemia pa mrna3927 

pa is an inherited metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality and our mrna therapy is ongoing in a phase 1 trial aiming to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme complex to treat the disorder 

pa is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality there are approximately 3252000 pa patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0212100000 newborns and mortality rates the vast majority of patients present with lifethreatening metabolic crises during the first few days or weeks of life with mortality rates ranging from 1353 during the neonatal period the cardinal feature of the disorder is the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic decompensations that are more frequent in the first few years of life longer term sequelae include cardiac complications cardiomyopathy arrhythmias and severe neurologic complications the disorder is caused by a defect or deficiency in pcc an enzyme that is one step upstream in the same metabolic pathway as the mut enzyme that is deficient in mma as further described below pcc is a complex heterododecamer enzyme composed of six alpha subunits pcca and six beta subunits pccb the disorder is autosomal recessive with pa patients generally having lossoffunction mutations in either pcca or pccb and in rare instances mutations in both pcca and pccb the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 3hydroxypropionic acid and 2methylcitrate among others and these metabolites may be used as biomarkers of disease there is no approved therapy for pa to treat the underlying defect including no enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of pcc and mitochondrial localization 

we are developing an ivadministered combination mrna approach which contains two mrnas one for each of the subunits of pcc pcca and pccb encapsulated in our proprietary lnp the same lnp formulation as mrna1944 the intent is to potentially treat the entire pa population regardless of whether an individual has a defect or deficiency in the pcc alpha or beta subunit the mrna sequences have been engineered to improve protein translation and encode enzymaticallyactive pcc with the proper subcellular localization in the mitochondria 

latest data and next steps 

we have demonstrated activity in a pa mouse model in a longterm repeat dose study in the 6month repeat dose study in pa mice a significant and sustained lowering of additional disease biomarkers eg 2methylcitrate or 2mc was observed throughout the duration of the 6month study mrna3927 is ongoing in a phase 12 study the paramount study and the first cohort is fully enrolled and cohort 2 enrollment is ongoing the study’s objective is to evaluate the safety and pharmacology of mrna3927 in patients 1 year of age and older with pa the primary endpoints are safety and pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics secondary endpoints include incidence and severity of adverse events aes and change in plasma biomarkers methylcitric acid 2mc and 3hydroxypropionic acid 3hp we have received rare pediatric disease designation orphan drug designation and fast track designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission for the pa program 

methylmalonic acidemia mma mrna3705 

mma is an inherited metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality and our mrna therapy is ongoing in a phase 1 trial aiming to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme complex to treat the disorder 

there are an estimated 5002000 mma mut deficiency patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0312100000 newborns and mortality rates mortality is significant with mortality rates of 50 for mma patients with complete mut deficiency mut 0  median age of death 2 years and 40 for mma patients with partial mut deficiency mut   median age of death 45 years reported in a large european study mma mainly affects the pediatric population and usually presents in the first few days or weeks of life the occurrence of acute metabolic decompensations is the hallmark of the disorder and decompensations are typically more frequent in the first few years of life each decompensation is lifethreatening and often requires hospitalization and management at an intensive care unit surviving patients often suffer from numerous complications including chronic renal failure and neurologic complications such as movement disorders developmental delays and seizures consequently the healthrelated quality of life for mma patients and their families is significantly impaired 

the disorder is autosomal recessive and primarily caused by lossoffunction mutations in the gene encoding mut a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes certain proteins and fats resulting in complete mut 0  or partial mut   enzyme deficiency there are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for mma 

we are developing an mrna encoding human mut encapsulated in our proprietary lnps for iv administration for the treatment of isolated mma associated with mut deficiency the sequence has been engineered to improve protein translation to function the mrnaencoded mut protein is translocated to its site of action in the mitochondria mrna3705 is our second generation mma development candidate 

latest data and next steps 

we previously demonstrated in a series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies that human mut mrna effectively directs the biosynthesis of active mut protein with physiologically correct mitochondrial localization in vitro and improves survival and corrects biochemical abnormalities in two different mouse models of mma representing the spectrum of mut deficiency mut0 and mut technology and process improvements enabled the development of an updated drug product mrna3705 which shows greater potency and better pharmacology compared to our prior candidate mrna3704 mrna3705 is currently ongoing in a phase 12 study the landmark study the study is an adaptive openlabel study is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of up to five different dosing regimens of mrna3705 administered via intravenous infusion in patients one year and older with isolated methylmalonic acidemia due to methylmalonylcoa mutase hmut upon establishment of an optimized dose based on safety and pharmacological data additional patients may be enrolled in an optional expansion cohort 

glycogen storage disease type 1a gsd1a mrna3745 

gsd1a is an inherited metabolism disease and our approach is to use an mrna encoding for intracellular human glucose 6phosphatase 

gsd1a is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the catalytic activity of g6pase g6pase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose6phosphate to glucose and inorganic phosphate the final step of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis that mainly takes place in the liver and kidneys gsd1a patients suffer from severe fasting hypoglycemia hepatomegaly nephromegaly lactic acidemia hypertriglyceridemia hyperuricemia hypercholesterolemia hepatic steatosis and growth retardation in addition hepatocellular adenomas occur in 70 to 80 of gsd1a patients by their third decade of life and carries risk of transformation into hepatocellular carcinomas proteinuria has been observed in over half of patients above 25 years of age gsd1a occurs in approximately 1100000 live births in the united states and european union but is more common in ashkenazi jews where the incidence is reported to be 120000 live births there are an estimated 2500 people in the united states and over 4000 people in the european union with gsd1a although strict diet therapy including frequent feeding with uncooked cornstarch allows gsd1a patients to live into adulthood by preventing hypoglycemia the underlying pathological processes remain uncorrected resulting in the development of many longterm complications including liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma 

our program mrna3745 consists of an mrna encoding for modified human g6pase encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the human g6pase sequence is modified for improved protein production and g6pase activity mrna3745 is designed to be administered intravenously and encodes g6pase protein to restore this deficient or defective enzyme

phenylketonuria pku mrna3283 

pku is a rare inherited metabolic disease is and our approach is to use an mrna encoding for intracellular phenylalanine hydroxylase pah 

phenylketonuria pku is a rare inherited metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency in the metabolism of phenylalanine phe due to mutations within the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase pah the most effective treatment is a restrictive diet of low protein which controls phe intake approximately 2056 of pku patients respond to sapropterin dihydrochloride marketed as kuvan in the united states a synthetic bh4 cofactor for pah which improves phe metabolism but does not fully cure patients in addition in may 2018 biomarin received approval for pegylated phenylalanine lyase pal marketed as palynziq palynziq is a pegylated recombinant bacterial enzyme which metabolizes phe in the blood we believe the immune risk is at least in part driven by bacterial pal pku occurs in approximately 11000015000 live births in the united states  based on current population estimates that would translate into approximately 2100032000 pku patients in the united states affected individuals have a deficiency in the enzyme pah resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine thus pku patients suffer from a phenylalanine intoxication and a subsequent deprivation of tyrosine leading to severe mental disability if left untreated 

our program mrna3283 consists of an mrna encoding human pah encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the mrna sequence is optimized for protein synthesis and contains a microrna binding site to reduce or potentially eliminate synthesis of protein outside of the target tissues mrna3283 is designed to be administered intravenously to encode enzymaticallyactive pah protein in liver to restore this deficient or defective enzyme

we have conducted several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for pah therapy a pku mouse model demonstrated a significant reduction of blood phe levels post dose mrna3283 is ongoing in preclinical studies 

criglernajjar syndrome type 1 cn1 mrna3351 

cn1 is a severe condition caused by the mutations in the ugt1a1 gene and our approach in collaboration with the institute of life changing medicines ilcm is to encode for the human ugta1a1 protein 

criglernajjar syndrome is a severe condition characterized by high levels of a toxic substance called bilirubin in the blood hyperbilirubinemia it is caused by the mutations in the ugt1a1 gene in which bilirubin a substance made by the liver cannot be broken down without this enzyme bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to jaundice and damage to the brain muscles and nerves the symptoms become apparent shortly after birth and can be lifethreatening it is estimated that there are only approximately 70100 known cases of cn1 in the world affected individuals rely on current standard of care phototherapy treatments of up to 12 hours a day throughout life the only definitive treatment is liver transplant that is associated with its own set of side effects and risk of death 

our program mrna3351 consists of an mrna encoding human ugta1 encapsulated in our proprietary lnps it is designed to restore the missing or dysfunctional proteins that causes cn1 

latest data and next steps 

we have licensed mrna3351 to ilcm with no upfront fees and without any downstream payments the goal of the collaboration is to make an mrna therapy for the treatment of cn1 available at no cost to patients ilcm will be responsible for the clinical development of mrna3351 

inhaled pulmonary therapeutics 

our inhaled pulmonary therapeutics modality currently has one development candidate 

cystic fibrosis cf vxc522 

cf is a multisystem disease caused by the mutations in the cftr gene and our approach in collaboration with vertex is to deliver mrna to the lungs to provide functional cftr protein expression that translates to transformative clinical benefit 

cf is a rare genetic disease which is progressive from birth and leads to multiorgan damage and early death due to lung dysfunction it is caused by the mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator cftr gene which results in the loss of cftr chloride ion channel function this decreased function of cftr at the cell surface leads to thick sticky mucus in multiple organ systems but most pathologically the lungs it is estimated that there are 75000 patients with cystic fibrosis in the world with 10 of these patients not addressable with the approved cftr modulators 

our program is designed to treat the underlying cause of cf by enabling cells in the lungs to produce functional cftr protein for the treatment of the 10 of patients who do not produce any modulatorresponsive cftr protein 

latest data and next steps 

we are collaborating with vertex on our cf candidate vxc522 preclinical studies are ongoing and vertex expects to submit an ind in 2022 

manufacturing 

manufacturing plays a critical role in our value chain and our ability to develop a new class of medicines our manufacturing capabilities support every stage of the development of our products from new product ideas to commercialization during the research stage of product development manufacturing provides mrna drug substance and drug product for platform research and therapeutic area drug discovery during early development of our investigational medicines we manufacture mrna and drug product for indenabling glp toxicology studies and initial human clinical studies for late clinical development we produce mrna and drug product for phase 3 studies at the commercial stage of development we manufacture drug substance and drug product in collaboration with our contract manufacturing organizations cmos both in the us and internationally 

our approach to date has been to proactively invest and build manufacturing capacity internally and externally with our network of strategic partners in anticipation of demand this capacity was immediately leveraged and expanded during our covid19 vaccine rampup into a commercial product in response to the ongoing pandemic our ability to rapidly accelerate our manufacturing capabilities in response to covid19 allowed us to ship 807 million doses of our covid19 vaccine globally in 2021 compared to 17 million doses in december 2020 we are committed to further increase our manufacturing capacity substantially in 2022 

overview of our manufacturing operating model 

our manufacturing activities generally focus on the following 

• commercial production our manufacturing expertise includes stateoftheart technologies for mrna and drug product manufacturing as well as quality control testing to attain a robust and consistent supply that matches target product profiles our manufacturing technology is built to scaleup and support industrialization of products for commercial approval 

• research and development support the product supply enables platform research and drug discovery in our therapeutic and vaccine areas in addition to activities related to clinical studies of our investigational medicines 

given our expectations for significant ongoing pipeline expansion and the long lead time required to build manufacturing infrastructure we built a dedicated inhouse manufacturing facility in norwood ma the moderna technology center mtc which we have since expanded to a multibuilding campus the mtc provides supply for our preclinical research indenabling glp toxicology study supplies our phase 1 and phase 2 pipeline activities laterstage clinical development activities eg phase 3 cmv vaccine clinical trials as well as covid19 vaccine drug substance production 

the mtc campus has been designed with a high level of automation and stateoftheart digital integration to handle manufacturing execution product testing and release and regulatory filings in addition substantial manufacturing capabilities are realized via cmo relationships in the united states and abroad providing drug substance and fillfinish capacity for the covid19 vaccine much of the production for our covid19 vaccine supply for the us market is completed at the mtc campus with additional production by lonza ltd lonza we have also partnered with lonza to complete production in switzerland of our covid19 vaccine for markets outside the united states as well as with national resilience inc to manufacture drug substance at its facility in ontario canada for distribution worldwide fillfinish services for our covid19 vaccine are provided by catalent inc thermo fisher scientific sanofi and baxter biopharma solutions in the united states and by rovi in spain recipharm in france and samsung biologics in south korea outside the united states we have also partnered with other cmos for the production of and fillfinish services of our covid19 vaccine and expect that we will enter into additional collaborations as we continue to scale in april 2021 we announced additional investments in manufacturing to increase supply at our owned and partnered manufacturing facilities with the goal of increasing our global 2022 capacity for covid19 vaccine production in may 2021 we announced the planned expansion of the mtc which we expect to more than double the space at the mtc and allow us to continue to optimize our mrna products as we explore new pharmaceutical delivery forms such as prefilled syringes and lyophilized products additionally in february 2022 we announced new collaborations with rovi and thermo fisher scientific thermo fisher for manufacturing capabilities with rovi we agreed to a tenyear collaboration to increase manufacturing capacity at rovi’s facilities in spain in addition to producing our covid19 vaccine we expect that rovis platform may be utilized to service other vaccine candidates in the future with thermo fisher we agreed to a fifteenyear collaboration to enable dedicated largescale manufacturing in the united states of our covid19 vaccine and other investigational mrna medicines in our pipeline 

in addition during 2021 we announced agreements in principle with the governments of canada and australia to establish mrna manufacturing facilities in those countries these agreements are subject to final negotiation but we envision entering into longterm supply agreements with these countries for the supply of mrna vaccines by establishing manufacturing facilities locally we will also provide these governments with direct access to rapid pandemic response capabilities we are in active discussions with other governments to provide similar manufacturing capabilities in other geographies 

we have further committed to building a stateoftheart mrna facility in africa to provide a local source of mrna medicines for the continent in part to prepare for future pandemics we expect to invest up to 500 million in this facility and anticipate that once fully operational it will be capable of producing up to 500 million doses of vaccines annually at the 50 µg dose level

to support our broad pipeline of products which span multiple therapeutic areas and routes of administration eg intramuscular intratumoral and intravenous there is close collaboration between our platform research and technical development teams to facilitate rapid and seamless clinical translation of scientific breakthroughs this in turn enables us to develop potential vaccines and therapies to serve a widening patient population 

technical development encompasses the design and optimization of robust and consistent manufacturing processes product characterization fitforpurpose formulations and product presentations for instance our novel hardware platforms’ automation and robotics coupled with the flexibility of our inhouse digital development systems allows for thousands of experiments and process parameters across our projects thus supporting our drug product pharmaceutical readiness moreover our recent technical manufacturing advances have enabled internalization of new key capabilities including dna plasmids and small molecules 

in parallel we have refined existing processes resulting in increased manufacturing scale and more robust stability of our mrna and drug product these improvements allow us significant control over our supply chain resulting in larger production yields and longer shelf life of our products furthermore formulation development advancements have added new drug product images including lyophilization giving us a path from frozen to refrigerated storage conditions 

our substantial investments in recent years in technical development has enabled the breadth and depth of our pipeline and laid the foundation to help meet the needs and requirements associated with late stage development and the commercialization of the covid19 vaccine 

supply of mrna for all stages of product development and commercialization 

supply for research 

highthroughput automation and custom engineered equipment allow us to produce and deliver high quality mrna and formulated constructs in a short period of time our proprietary platform is capable of producing up to 1000 lots of mrna sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks from sequence to final product the typical scale of mrna manufactured by this team is 1–1000 mg this has been possible in part thanks to the ability of researchers in the moderna ecosystem to order constructs through an integrated digital portal that tracks materials endtoend in less than 45 days in addition multiple integrated algorithms that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning optimize manufacturability reduce failures and increase quality of mrna sequences 

supply for early development 

we have established manufacturing capabilities that support the early development stage of product development in three key areas glp tox clinical studies and personalized cancer vaccines we supply mrna and formulated product to conduct indenabling glp toxicology studies in addition human clinical studies rely on supply to meet required cgmp standards this is achieved via internal manufacturing at the mtc and external manufacturing at wellestablished cmos we select specialized cmos to support our portfolio we will continue to selectively partner with cmos to complement our capacity and provide supply contingency where needed our mtc facility is also suited to enable rapid technology development and scaleup for future needs our manufacturing also produces cgmp pcvs due to the specialized nature of personalized medicine ie where a batch is specifically designed and manufactured for a single patient the manufacturing personalized vaccine unit pvu has unique requirements we digitally integrate patientspecific data from sequencing tumor samples to automatically design pcvs for patients we have developed proprietary bioinformatics designed algorithms linked to an automated manufacturing process for rapid production of formulated mrna with a typical turnaround time of a few weeks we have operationalized pcv manufacturing at the mtc campus to meet our phase 1 and 2 pipeline supply needs by using singleuse systems with fast “needletoneedle” turnaround times unlike traditional process development each pcv batch is manufactured for a single patient and thus scaledout in parallel with extensive use of automation and robotics to account for the larger number of patients involved in later phases of development and commercialization we have shown consistent quality in our production of over 160 patient batches each with unique mrna sequences 

these capabilities have allowed us to build our broad pipeline of 44 development programs including the output required to supply related toxicological and human clinical studies while the technology that underpins these programs is the same each program typically requires customization based on target product profiles these custom features range from varying molecular architecture to different routes of administration often requiring multivalent products for example our cmv vaccine mrna1647 requires six different mrna sequences to be manufactured for inclusion in an intramuscular mrna medicine whereas our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 requires a single mrna sequence for inclusion in an intramuscular mrna medicine all programs with the exception of pcv require that we progressively scale up supply to meet clinical demand requirements across development phases in addition to 

the necessary preparation for regulatory approval and commercial production which demand larger batch sizes in contrast the pcv program seeks to develop a cancer vaccine that is designed and manufactured for a specific patient thus increasing the number of unique batches as we scale manufacturing output for each program we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates 

supply for latestage development and commercialization 

as we continue to manufacture our covid19 vaccine our development pipeline continues to advance to laterstage development and towards commercialization our platform approach allows us to continue to evolve our manufacturing suites and other capabilities at our mtc campus building expansions and enhancements have continued throughout scaleup of our covid19 vaccine manufacturing capabilities the modular nature of the mtc suites permits us to manufacture multiple products in parallel for instance we can produce drug substance and drug product for our phase 3 cmv clinical trial while manufacturing covid19 drug substance in the same facilities 

quality unit 

quality is core to the way we operate we seek to ensure quality at moderna through a combination of a robust quality management system qms our quality culture and our people in accordance with applicable regulations we have established documented and implemented a qms to assure continued compliance with the requirements therein the qms facilitates cgmp compliance by implementing practices that identify the various required processes their application throughout the organization and the sequence of interaction of these processes 

the primary mode of documenting these key practices is through policies standard operating procedures sops forms and other quality records which include an overarching quality policy and quality manual we have implemented measurement tools and metrics to monitor measure and analyze these practices to support cgmp operations achieve planned results and support continuous improvement we monitor these quality metrics through formal governance processes including quality management review qmr to enable continuous improvement we have also established an independent quality unit that fulfills quality assurance and quality control responsibilities 

our quality unit grew into an international organization with the introduction of covid19 vaccine manufacturing quality drives our quality culture and ensures it is applied consistently and thoughtfully across the globe 

while the quality unit is ultimately accountable and responsible for quality this is a shared responsibility all cgmp personnel are empowered to ensure quality systems are appropriately maintained and executed 

we have established a culture that encourages transparency accountability and ownership of quality at all levels in the organization as we scale the quality organization we have focused on hiring the best talent with the required experience training and education 

supply chain unit 

we have established an international supply chain to enable supply of the raw materials used to produce our mrnas and the components of our formulations securing supply for covid19 vaccine alongside clinical and preclinical demands we have worked with our supply chain vendors to characterize critical raw materials and to understand their impact on the quality of mrna drug substance and formulated drug product we also assess the quality system and performance of our supply chain vendors and work with them to comply with regulatory requirements 

digital infrastructure 

we believe that digital technologies such as robotics automation artificial intelligence ai and cloud computing are critical to operationalize our strategy accelerate our pace of learning and execute at scale we aspire to digitize our operations wherever possible with the goal of using the power of digital technology to maximize our impact on patients since our inception we have invested heavily in our digital technologies roboticsautomation analytics data science and ai to facilitate our growth we will continue to invest in our digital infrastructure construction has begun on our new moderna science center in cambridge which is designed to integrate digitalfirst scientific research and development labs our approach to bring these digital technologies into our workflows and processes has involved the following

we utilize six building blocks for our digital infrastructure 

• cloud enablement is a critical component of our digital infrastructure we are at the forefront of mrna technology we generate complex data   sets and our scientists need computational power and agility to operate without being limited by traditional computing technology maintaining digital infrastructure in the cloud provides the benefits of lower costs by simplifying provisioning and administration flexibility scalability ease of maintenance disaster recovery and information security 

• integration of business processes enables us to streamline processes and bring data together in a consistent manner avoiding caches of   information and manual intervention this efficient flow of data between systems enables the automation of our business processes 

• internet of things allows for smart interconnected devices that provide realtime synchronization of operations the data from equipment   provides realtime guidance to our scientists and engineers and helps us in supply chain and manufacturing with compliance and traceability including tracking material controlling inventory and optimizing instrument usage 

• automation allows us to scale our operations reliably and reproducibly with the help of custom hardware solutions and stateoftheart robotics   we can continue to increase our operating efficiency reduce errors and improve our quality and compliance 

• advanced analytics enable us to draw insights from our data we are constantly generating large data sets that can provide important insights if   mined appropriately and regularly 

• ai is enabling key breakthroughs in predictive modeling it will allow us to improve our mrna design algorithms   based on machine learning and will provide us with critical insights into research supply chain manufacturing and other processes 

digital technologies to enable our drug discovery efforts 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies to drive a rapid pace of learning enable efficient workflows and business processes and draw insights from vast amounts of data our aim is to provide our platform and discovery scientists with access to an environment that helps them through each step of their research cycle 

drug design studio our proprietary inhouse digital application suite contains a sequence designer module to tailor an entire mrna with everimproving   rule sets that contain our accumulated learning about mrna design drug design studio utilizes cloudbased computational capacity to run various algorithms we have developed to design each mrna sequence the utility of cloudbased capacity allows us to provide flexible computational capacity on demand allowing us to power parallel intake and design of multiple mrna sequences once a sequence is designed it can be ordered digitally using an internal order form application within drug design studio 

manufacture of researchgrade mrna once an order is optimized the mrna production process is triggered we have developed proprietary interfaces   that allow the manufacturing team to track production orders at every stage we have automated several manufacturing steps using both offtheshelf and custom automation the equipment used in the manufacture of researchgrade 

mrna is integrated with the digital interfaces to capture extract and interpret the data generated at each step of the manufacturing process building digital traceability on each mrna order we have also embedded realtime algorithms and analytics tools to allow for automated decisionmaking at some stages accelerate the quality control workflows and provide for continuous improvement of manufacturing processes 

dispatching and shipping mrna because we produce large quantities of researchgrade mrna we require digital tools to track their shipment to our   scientists and to external contract research organizations cros conducting in vivo studies our dispatching and shipping application automatically generates barcoded labels allowing for traceability of product 

inventory and registry material used in research and created in production including mrna cell lines chemicals and reagents is tracked in our inventory   application this application supports numerous workflow tools such as consumption aliquoting material transfer and stock alerts critical material types are assigned unique registry identification by our registry application 

study design using our drug design studio our scientists can design their   in vivo   studies using our proprietary study design application this application   captures in vivo study protocol design parameters including dose amount number of doses frequency samples and assays for each sample this application serves two purposes it allows our scientists to maintain and track their in vivo study designs and associated research grade mrna our study design application also allows our in vivo pharmacology teams to track the various ongoing studies and leverage external cros to manage the in vivo demand as needed 

experiment management we have deployed electronic lab notebooks for experiment management allowing our scientists to streamline documentation of   their experiments and track it in a standardized searchable repository we have also integrated electronic lab notebooks further with our other research tools to connect inventory in vivo studies and instrument data 

advanced analytics and ai to accelerate the pace of learning we utilize ai to enable various parts of our platform and drug discovery examples include 

• neural networks for protein engineering  one way to optimize the efficacy of the proteins encoded by our mrna is to engineer the sequence of   the protein itself we use neural networks to analyze and model protein sequences we train these models by inputting orthologous sequences from thousands of organisms from which we can generate potential protein sequences optimized for specific attributes 

• neural networks for mrna engineering  the redundancy in the genetic code allows for a large number of mrna sequences that encode the   same protein mrna sequence may impact translation thereby impacting the amount of protein produced in circulation we are developing ai tools to predict mrna sequences that can enhance protein expression 

• automated sanger sequencing analysis  sanger sequencing is used repeatedly to quality check qc our dna templates and final mrna while the data contain every nucleotide in a sequence it is very complex to analyze a fully automated data pipeline starts processing raw data the moment it is saved to the cloud by the sequencers the pipeline spawns numerous aws computer servers to run an analysis algorithm and then shuts the servers down minimizing costs the results are viewable in a powerful dynamic visualization tool we have run over three million sanger data files through this system we have further improved our sanger analysis with a convolutional neural network cnn to better analyze the tail sections of mrna as well 

digital technologies to enable our clinical trials 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies to drive the rapid pace of advancement in parallel of our development candidates into the clinic

inlicensed intellectual property 

while we develop and manufacture our potential mrna medicines using our internally created mrna technology platform we also seek out and evaluate third party technologies and ip that may be complementary to our platform 

patent sublicense agreements with cellscript and mrna ribotherapeutics 

the trustees of the university of pennsylvania owns several issued us patents granted european patents and pending us patent applications directed in part to nucleosidemodified mrnas and their uses or the penn modified mrna patents mrna 

ribotherapeutics inc mrt obtained an exclusive license to the penn modified mrna patents and granted its affiliate cellscript llc cellscript a sublicense to the penn modified mrna patents in certain fields of use 

in june 2017 we entered into two sublicense agreements one with cellscript and one with mrt which agreements we collectively refer to as the cellscriptmrt agreements together the cellscriptmrt agreements grant us a worldwide sublicensable sublicense to the penn modified mrna patents to research develop make and commercialize products covered by the penn modified mrna patents or licensed products for all in vivo uses in humans and animals including therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic applications the cellscriptmrt agreements are nonexclusive although cellscript and mrt are subject to certain time restrictions on granting additional sublicenses for in vivo uses in humans under the penn modified mrna patents 

we paid cellscript and mrt aggregate sublicense grant fees of 28 million upon entering into the cellscriptmrt agreements 25 million in early 2018 and 22 million in early 2019 cellscript and mrt are collectively eligible to receive on a licensed productbylicensed product basis milestone payments totaling up to 05 million upon the achievement of certain regulatorybased events for diagnostic products and milestone payments totaling up to 15 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatorybased events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products and up to 24 million upon the achievement of certain commercialbased events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products the cellscriptmrt agreements require us to pay royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products at rates in the low single digits for therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic uses and royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products sold for research uses at rates in the midsingle digits subject to certain reductions with an aggregate minimum floor following the first commercial sale of licensed products under a cellscriptmrt agreement we are required to pay cellscript or mrt as applicable minimum annual royalties ranging from 10000 to 400000 depending on the use of such licensed product with all such payments creditable against earned royalties on net sales in 2021 we paid 641 million in royalties and milestone payments to cellscript in connection with sales of our covid19 vaccine 

the cellscriptmrt agreements will terminate upon the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire or become abandoned of the penn modified mrna patents cellscript or mrt as applicable may terminate its respective cellscriptmrt agreement if we fail to make required payments or otherwise materially breach the applicable agreement subject to specified notice and cure provisions cellscript or mrt as applicable may also terminate the applicable cellscriptmrt agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the penn modified mrna patents we have the right to terminate each cellscriptmrt agreement at will upon 60 days’ prior notice to cellscript or mrt as applicable provided that we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products upon such termination if rights to mrt or cellscript under the penn modified mrna patents are terminated eg due to bankruptcy of mrt or cellscript the terminated party will assign its interest in the respective cellscriptmrt agreement to the licensor from which it received rights under the penn modified mrna patents and our rights will continue under the new licensor 

formulation technology inlicenses 

our development candidates use internally developed formulation technology that we own we do however have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents covering formulation technologies under licenses from other entities if in the future we elect to use or to grant our strategic collaborators sublicenses to use these inlicensed formulation technologies we or our strategic collaborators may be liable for milestone and royalty payment obligations arising from such use we consider the commercial terms of these licenses and their provisions regarding diligence insurance indemnification and other similar matters to be reasonable and customary for our industry 

human capital 

we had approximately 2700 fulltime employees as of december 31 2021 representing a more than doubling of our workforce from 1300 fulltime employees as of the end of the prior year we have undertaken significant hiring of employees to facilitate manufacturing of our covid19 vaccine in addition to building out our commercial and regulatory organizations as well as other functions to support this continued rollout we also increased our hiring outside the united states during 2021 and at yearend we had employees in 12 countries around the world with a presence in north america europe and the asiapacific region much of this hiring has been of talent with experience at other pharmaceutical companies as we continue to build out our commercial and regulatory capabilities particularly as we fill roles to facilitate our operations and commercial activities in markets around the globe we have also continued to hire talent to support our research and clinical capabilities across the rest of our pipeline unrelated to our covid19 vaccine 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for human capital particularly as we seek to attract and retain talent with experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors our workforce is highly educated and as of december 31 2021 47 of our employees hold phd doctorate md jd or master’s degrees among our employees as of december 31 2021 47  are female among our leadership which we define as employees at the vice president level and above as of december 31 2021 approximately 39  are female an increase from 37 in the prior year 40 of our us employees identify as racially or ethnically diverse as of 

december 31 2021 an increase from 35 in the prior year in 2021 we continued to act on our commitment to belonging inclusion  diversity by among other things 

• engaging all members of our executive committee vice presidents and managers in our conscious inclusion education series

• doubling the number of our employee resource groups and 

• joining the disabilityin inclusion works program an initiative that assists employers in all aspects of disability inclusion at work 

to help promote alignment between our employees and our shareholders all employees participate in our equity programs through the receipt of equity grants and the percentage of equity as a component of overall pay mix increases with seniority we believe that in addition to incentivizing growth that leads to shareholder value broad eligibility for our equity programs helps promote employee retention as these awards generally vest over a fouryear period 

throughout the covid19 pandemic we have implemented various initiatives to promote the safety of our workforce and continuity of our operations we created a coronavirus response team that is responsible for implementing various safety measures at our global sites our protocols include regular covid19 testing and the provision personal protective equipment ppe throughout the pandemic much of our workforce has worked remotely wherever possible and when local conditions recommend social distancing we also implemented remote hiring and onboarding programs to facilitate significant hiring during 2021 in a remote work environment 

since october 2021 we have required all of our employees in the united states to be vaccinated against covid19 including having received a booster dose absent an approved medical or religious accommodation in december 2020 following the receipt of an emergency use authorization from the fda for our covid19 vaccine we made the vaccine available to our employees and adult members of their households to help ensure continuity of our operations due to the critical nature of our production of the vaccine in december 2021 and early 2022 as the omicron variant drove a surge in covid19 cases globally we made booster doses of our vaccine available to our usbased employees and adult members of their households as well as to employees of our swiss subsidiary 

none of our employees are represented by a labor union and none of our employees have entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us other than a small number of employees in france italy and spain who are covered by collective bargaining agreements governing certain benefits and working conditions we consider our employee relations to be good 

we believe that our employees are highly engaged and we and our employees have been recognized by surveys conducted by external groups science magazine ranked us as a top employer for each of the last seven years additionally in 2021 biospace ranked us the number one employer in its 2022 best places to work in biopharma report and fast company named us the number one company on its 2021 best workplaces for innovators list we measure employee engagement through a vendorsupplied engagement software using validated external benchmarks to track quarteroverquarter employee engagement factors

in december 2021 we announced the launch of our artificial intelligence ai academy in partnership with carnegie mellon university the ai academy is intended to educate and empower our workforce to identify and integrate ai and machine learning solutions into our systems and processes 

additionally with the continued rapid growth of our company we articulated the moderna mindsets in late 2021 the moderna mindsets are a set of leadership behaviors we use to make decisions and lead the company we consider the mindsets to be key as our company continues to scale and we are working to integrate them into all of our hr processes including performance management our employees participate in the mindsets workshops which is an interactive fullimmersion learning experience designed to provide the opportunity to engage with better understand and learn how to apply the mindsets in the workplace 

to further develop and retain our workforce we conduct periodic talent reviews that identify key talent within the organization we use that data to inform specific development opportunities for key current and potential future leaders and to support our periodic succession planning activities for key roles these steps together ensure we have a robust understanding of our workforce and a talent pipeline to grow future leaders 

corporate social responsibility 

in pursuit of our mission to deliver on the promise of mrna science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients we have scaled our operations invested in research and building out our manufacturing and commercial capabilities and hired toptier talent as we continue to mature we believe it is important to develop longterm programs that underscore our commitment to corporate social responsibility please refer to the “responsibility” section of our website which can be found at wwwmodernatxcom as well as our proxy statement related to our 2022 annual meeting of stockholders that we will file with the sec for a description of some of the measures we have taken to support our commitment to corporate social responsibility 

competition 

the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition there is also a strong emphasis on defense of intellectual property and proprietary products 

mrna medicines and our covid19 vaccine 

we believe that mrna as a medicine coupled with our capabilities across mrna technology drug discovery development and manufacturing provide us with a competitive advantage however we face competition from others developing mrna vaccines and therapeutics as well as other medicines that compete or could compete with our mrna products development candidates and investigational medicines we face competition from various sources including large pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies academic institutions government agencies and public and private research institutions for any products that we eventually commercialize we will not only compete with existing medicines but also compete with medicines that may become available in the future we also face competition when entering into strategic alliances to advance and grow our pipeline 

we face significant competition in the market for our covid19 vaccine particularly from established pharmaceutical companies with longer operating histories and significant experience in producing and marketing pharmaceutical products in the united states the us fda has granted a bla to the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine for the prevention of covid19 in individuals 16 years of age and older the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine has also been authorized under an eua as a twodose primary series for individuals five years of age and older as a third primary series dose for individuals five years of age and older who have been determined to have certain kinds of immunocompromise and as a single booster dose for individuals 12 years of age and older at least five months after completing a primary series of the vaccine the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine has also been authorized for use as a single booster dose for individuals 18 years of age and older following completion of primary vaccination with a different available covid19 vaccine the cdc has recommended that individuals starting their covid19 vaccine series or receiving a booster dose receive either our covid19 vaccine or the pfizerbiontech covid19 vaccine the johnson  johnsonjanssen viral vector covid19 vaccine is also authorized under an eua outside the united states our covid19 vaccine has been authorized for use or approved in more than 70 countries in addition to receiving authorization from the world health organization in many of these jurisdictions our vaccine is authorized for use in adolescents ages 1217 internationally our covid19 vaccine competes against over two dozen vaccines that have been authorized in various jurisdictions and many other vaccine candidates remain in development including other mrna vaccines 

additionally competitors have developed treatments for covid19 and additional treatments may be developed in the future for example pfizer and merck have developed antiviral pills for the treatment of mildtomoderate covid19 disease for certain adults who have tested positive for covid19 to the extent that these or other treatments are viewed as an alternative to vaccination against covid19 our competitive position could be harmed 

competition for the sale of our covid19 vaccine can be impacted by a number of factors including the efficacy of our vaccine in preventing covid19 particularly in the prevention of severe cases of covid19 the ability of our vaccine or future iterations of the vaccine and boosters to protect effectively against variants of the sarscov2 virus perceptions of the efficacy of our vaccine concerns about potential side effects from the vaccine its safety or tolerability the novelty of mrnabased technology storage and handling conditions for our vaccine and the ease or difficulty with which it can be distributed the timing and scope of regulatory approvals reimbursement coverage our costs to produce and distribute our vaccine and our ability to scale our manufacturing and distribution effectively as we continue to expand shipments internationally the competitiveness of our covid19 vaccine in the future may also depend upon whether we are successful in efforts to combine the vaccine with other vaccines like seasonal flu and rsv and whether our competitors are successful in similar efforts additionally standalone vaccines we may develop for respiratory diseases such as seasonal flu vaccines will face competition from existing vaccines and treatments as well as future medicines developed by competitors our competitive positioning may also be affected by the fact that we do not have as long a history of producing pharmaceutical products or existing commercial relationships compared to certain of our competitors 

there are additional companies that are working on mrna medicines some of which have reached commercialization companies with mrna programs include biontech and pfizer alone and in partnership with biontech and others other competitors include sanofi through the acquisition of translate bio curevac and glaxosmithkline arcturus therapeutics etherna immunotherapies ethris genevant sciences stemirna therapeutics and abogen biosciences which is developing a covid19 mrna vaccine in collaboration with walvax biotechnology and the pla academy of military science we also compete against other pharmaceutical companies in the market for covid19 vaccines that do not utilize mrnabased technologies including astrazeneca and johnson  johnson among others 

beyond mrna 

we and our strategic collaborators face competition from companies developing therapies in various areas other than the development of mrna medicines related to our collaborations for example there are a growing number of pharmaceutical biotechnology and academic institutions researching and developing autologous and allogeneic cart therapies in both the solid and liquid tumor setting these cart cell therapies are at various stages of development and approval and could compete against any cart therapeutics we discover develop and commercialize in collaboration with carisma therapeutics 

similarly there are many companies and institutions researching and developing crispr and other gene editing systems which could compete against any therapies for genetic diseases we develop and commercialize in collaboration with metagenomi or other collaborators 

government regulation 

government authorities in the united states at the federal state and local level and in other countries regulate among other things the research development manufacture and marketing of our products and product candidates generally before a new drug or biologic can be marketed considerable data demonstrating its quality safety and efficacy must be obtained and submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority 

us drug and biological product development 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the federal food drug and cosmetic act fdca and its implementing regulations and biologics under the fdca the public health service act phsa and their implementing regulations both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal state and local statutes and regulations failure to comply with applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions these sanctions could include among other actions the fda’s refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval license revocation a clinical hold untitled or warning letters voluntary or mandatory product recalls market withdrawals product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

any of our investigational medicines must be approved by the fda through a bla or new drug application nda process before they may be legally marketed in the united states the preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our current or future investigational medicines will be granted on a timely basis or at all 

preclinical studies 

before any of our product candidates may be tested in humans the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use the conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements including glp regulations for safetytoxicology studies an ind sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests together with manufacturing information analytical data any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies among other things to the fda as part of an ind an ind is a request for authorization from the fda to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin unless the fda raises concerns an ind automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the fda in such a case the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 

clinical trials 

the clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with gcp requirements clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the clinical trial dosing procedures subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy each protocol and any subsequent amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind furthermore each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an irb for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits the irb also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to clinical trial subjects and monitors the clinical trial until completed further progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials among other information must be submitted at least annually to the fda and more frequently in other situations including the occurrence of serious adverse events information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the wwwclinicaltrialsgov website 

under the us national institutes of health guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules the nih guidelines supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee ibc a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution while the nih guidelines are only mandatory for research being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving nih funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the nih guidelines voluntarily follow them 

foreign studies conducted under an ind must meet the same requirements that apply to studies being conducted in the united states data from a foreign study not conducted under an ind may be submitted in support of a bla if the study was conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the fda is able to validate the data 

clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap 

• phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or diseaseaffected patients to assess the metabolism pharmacologic action side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate 

• phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in diseaseaffected patients to evaluate proof of concept andor determine the dosing regimens for subsequent investigations at the same time safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted 

• phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use its safety in use and to establish the overall benefitrisk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling 

the fda may also require postapproval phase 4 nonregistrational studies to explore scientific questions to further characterize safety and efficacy during commercial use of a drug 

the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients additionally some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor known as a data safety monitoring board or committee this group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial concurrent with clinical trials companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and among other things companies must develop methods for testing the identity strength quality and purity of the final product 

fda review process 

following completion of the clinical trials data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the fda as part of a bla or nda along with proposed labeling chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data a bla is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety purity and potency an nda for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy to support marketing approval the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the fda fda approval of a bla or nda must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the united states 

before approving a bla or nda the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cgmp requirements and are adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications the fda also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with gcp requirements additionally the fda may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee of expert advisors for review evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions if any the committee makes a recommendation to the fda that is not binding but is generally followed 

after the fda evaluates a bla or nda it will grant marketing approval request additional information or issue a complete response letter crl outlining the deficiencies in the submission the crl may require additional testing or information including additional preclinical or clinical data for the fda to reconsider the application even if such additional information and data are submitted the fda may decide that the bla or nda still does not meet the standards for approval if the fda grants approval it issues an approval letter that authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications 

orphan drug designation 

under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200000 individuals in the united states or more than 200000 individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the united states for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product 

if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval except in very limited circumstances such if the latter product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product orphan drug exclusivity however also could block the approval of our products for seven years if a competitor first obtains approval of the same product as defined by the fda or if our drug candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease 

expedited development and review programs 

the fda may employ one of several tools to facilitate and expedite the development and review of a drug including fast track designation breakthrough therapy designation accelerated approval and priority review designation fast track designation is designed to facilitate the development and review of a drug that treats a serious condition and fills an unmet medical need breakthrough therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of a drug that treats a serious condition and 

preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates substantial improvement over available therapies priority review designation means the fda’s goal is to take action on an application within six months of filing the fda may grant priority review designation to a drug that would provide significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of a treatment diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition 

a product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies in addition it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality imm that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on imm or other clinical benefit as a condition of approval the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and wellcontrolled postmarketing clinical trials if the fda concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted it will require such postmarketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product if the fda determines that the conditions of approval are not being met the fda can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic 

even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs the fda may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for fda review or approval may not be shortened furthermore fast track designation priority review accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval 

emergency use authorization eua 

the secretary of health and human services hhs may authorize unapproved medical products to be marketed in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the us government the covid19 pandemic has been designated as such an emergency after an emergency has been announced the secretary of hhs may authorize the issuance of and the fda commissioner may issue euas for the use of specific products based on certain criteria including that the product may be effective in diagnosing treating or preventing serious or lifethreatening diseases when there are no adequate approved and available alternatives from december 18 2020 our covid19 vaccine was available under an eua for active immunization to prevent covid19 in individuals 18 years of age and older in january 2022 the fda approved the bla for our covid19 vaccine spikevax to prevent covid19 in individuals 18 years of age and older in the united states a booster dose of our covid19 vaccine at the 50 µg dose level is authorized for use under an eua for adults 18 years and older a third dose of our covid19 vaccine at the 100 µg dose level is authorized for use under an eua in immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age or older in the united states who have undergone solid organ transplantation or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise  an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates an eua is not a longterm alternative to obtaining fda approval licensure or clearance for a product the fda may revoke an eua for a variety of reasons including if the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization 

in the united states the public readiness and emergency preparedness act the prep act provides immunity for manufacturers from all claims under state or federal law for “loss” arising out of the administration or use of a “covered countermeasure” however injured persons may still bring a suit for “willful misconduct” against the manufacturer under some circumstances “covered countermeasures” include “qualified pandemic or epidemic products” including products intended to diagnose or treat pandemic or epidemic disease such as pandemic vaccines for these immunities to apply the secretary of hhs must issue a declaration in cases of public health emergency or “credible risk” of a future public health emergency on march 17 2020 the secretary of hhs issued a declaration under the prep act and has issued subsequent amendments thereto since then to provide liability immunity for activities related to certain countermeasures against the ongoing covid19 pandemic while we believe our products would be covered under the provisions of the prep act this cannot be assured 

pediatric information 

under the pediatric research equity act of 2003 all marketing applications for new active ingredients indications dosage forms dosing regimens or routes of administration must contain an assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in pediatric patients unless this requirement is waived deferred or inapplicable 

under the best pharmaceuticals for children act a product may be eligible for pediatric exclusivity which adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms this exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an fdaissued written request for such a study 

postapproval requirements 

following approval of a new product the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including among other things monitoring and recordkeeping activities reporting of adverse experiences complying with promotion and advertising requirements and limitations on industrysponsored scientific and educational activities although physicians may prescribe legally available products for offlabel uses manufacturers may not market or promote such uses prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the fda in conjunction with their first use further if there are any modifications 

to the drug or biologic including changes in indications labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities the applicant may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new bla or nda or bla or nda supplement which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials 

the fda may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems to assure the benefits of the product outweigh the risks a rems could include medication guides physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use such as restricted distribution methods patient registries and other risk minimization tools newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures including a rems or the conduct of postmarketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue product approvals may be withdrawn for noncompliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 

fda regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cgmp regulations we and our thirdparty manufacturers must comply with cgmp regulations that require among other things quality control and quality assurance the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cgmp entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections for compliance with cgmp requirements and other laws the discovery of violations could result in enforcement actions and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product manufacturer or holder of an approved bla or nda including recall 

us patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 

in certain circumstances some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly referred to as the hatch waxman amendments the hatch waxman amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and fda regulatory review process patent term restoration however cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of a bla or nda plus the time between the submission date of a bla or nda and the approval of that application only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent the uspto in consultation with the fda reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration 

if the fda approves a drug product that contains an active ingredient not previously approved the product is typically entitled to five years of nonpatent regulatory exclusivity other products may be entitled to three years of exclusivity if approval was based on the fda’s reliance on new clinical studies essential to approval submitted by the nda applicant if the nda applicant studies the product for use by children the fda may grant pediatric exclusivity which extends by 180 days each existing exclusivity patent and regulatory related to the product 

an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdalicensed reference biological product was created by the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 the bpci act biosimilarity requires a showing that the product is “highly similar” to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety purity and potency interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and for products administered multiple times to an individual that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the fda will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product 

european union drug development 

medicinal products can be marketed in the eu only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained similar to the united states the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the eu are subject to significant regulatory controls effective january 2022 the european commission adopted a new clinical trials regulation to streamline and harmonize the procedures for assessment and governance of clinical trials throughout the eu and to require that information on the authorization conduct and results of each clinical trial conducted in the eu be publicly available 

pediatric investigation plan 

an application for marketing authorization of a medicinal product for human use that is not yet authorized in the eu must include a pediatric investigational plan pip unless a waiver applies a scientific committee assesses the content of any pip waivers and 

deferrals for a medicinal product submitted to it in accordance with the regulation on medicinal products for pediatric use and formulates an opinion thereon 

european drug review and approval 

in the european economic area eea which is comprised of the 27 member states of the eu and norway iceland and liechtenstein medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure the centralized procedure which is compulsory for medicines produced by biotechnology or those medicines intended to treat aids cancer neurodegenerative disorders or diabetes and optional for those medicines that are highly innovative provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all eu member states in addition to the centralized procedure the eea also has a nationalized procedure which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country a decentralized procedure whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval and a mutual recognition procedure where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision 

european exclusivity 

in the eea new innovative products authorized for marketing ie reference products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon the grant of a marketing authorization data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the european union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the european union’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product and products may not qualify for data exclusivity 

european orphan designation and exclusivity 

orphan drug designation is available in the eea to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10000 persons in the eu community or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development and in each case for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis prevention or treatment has been authorized or if a method exists the product would be a significant benefit to those affected medicinal products that receive and maintain orphan drug designation are entitled to 10 years of market exclusivity following approval 

european data collection 

the data protection directive and the general data protection regulation gdpr governs the collection and use of personal data in the eu the gdpr imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals the security and confidentiality of the personal data data breach notification and the use of thirdparty processors in connection with the processing of the personal data the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu provides an enforcement authority and imposes large penalties for noncompliance including the potential for fines of up to €200 million or 40 of the annual global revenues of the infringer whichever is greater 

the uk has incorporated the gdpr as it existed on december 31 2020 but subject to certain uk specific amendments into uk law the uk gdpr the uk gdpr and the uk data protection act 2018 set out the uk’s data protection regime which is independent from but aligned to the eu’s data protection regime although the uk is regarded as a third country under the eu’s gdpr the european commission has issued a decision recognizing the uk as providing adequate protection under the eu gdpr and therefore transfers of personal data originating in the eu to the uk remain unrestricted like the gdpr the uk gdpr restricts personal data transfers outside the uk to countries not regarded by the uk as providing adequate protection the uk government has confirmed that personal data transfers from the uk to the eea remain free flowing 

eu drug marketing 

like the antikickback statute prohibition in the united states discussed below the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the eu infringement of relevant eu laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment payments may be made to physicians in limited circumstances and in certain eu member states such payments must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians for the provision of services often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization andor the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

rest of the world regulation 

outside of the united states and the eu the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country if we fail to comply with such requirements we may be subject to among other things fines suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals product recalls seizure of products operating restrictions or criminal prosecution 

other healthcare laws 

healthcare providers physicians and thirdparty payors including governmental payors such as medicare and medicaid will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval any arrangements with these parties may expose us to certain fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations in the united states these laws include among others 

• the antikickback statute which makes it illegal for any person to knowingly and willfully solicit receive offer or pay any remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind that is intended to induce or reward referrals including the purchase recommendation order or prescription of a particular drug or any other good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as medicare or medicaid 

• the federal false claims act which imposes civil penalties including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities including manufacturers for among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government 

• health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa which imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payors or falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services 

• hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 hitech and their respective implementing regulations which impose among other things requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 

• the physician payments sunshine act enacted as part of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca which requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs to disclose annually to the federal government for redisclosure to the public certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians teaching hospitals and certain nonphysician practitioners 

• federal government price reporting laws which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs 

• federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers 

• analogous state fraud and abuse laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor 

additionally certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information such data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa thus complicating compliance efforts for example the california consumer protection act ccpa established a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the state of california imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the ccpa and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches further the california privacy rights act cpra which is scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with certain provisions having retroactive effect to january 1 2022 will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information while clinical trial data and information governed by hipaa are currently exempt from the current versions of the ccpa and cpra other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the ccpa and cpra may broaden its scope 

the scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or other related governmental regulations we may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines imprisonment disgorgement exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid reputational harm additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with 

whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to similar actions penalties and sanctions ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities can be time and resourceconsuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business 

current and future healthcare reform legislation 

in the united states and foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any approved products the aca for example contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lowercost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by medicaid programs extension of medicaid rebates to medicaid managed care plans mandatory discounts for certain medicare part d beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs we expect that current laws as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or any strategic collaborators may receive for any approved products 

in the united states it is unclear whether the aca will be overturned or further amended we cannot predict what effect further changes to the aca would have on our business additionally other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted including the budget control act of 2011 which includes provisions to reduce the federal deficit the budget control act as amended resulted in the imposition of 2 reductions in medicare payments to providers which began in april 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken pursuant to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act the cares act as well as subsequent legislation these reductions have been suspended from may 1 2020 through march 31 2022 due to the covid19 pandemic then a 1 payment reduction will occur beginning april 1 2022 through june 30 2022 and the 2 payment reduction will resume on july 1 2022  

further there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which have resulted in several congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products in addition the federal government state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs including pricecontrols restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs for example the federal government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs 

environment 

we are subject to state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances including the occupational safety and health act the resource conservation and recovery act and the toxic substances control act these and other laws govern the use handling and disposal of various biologic chemical and radioactive substances used in and wastes generated by operations if our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances we could be liable for damages and governmental fines equivalent laws have been adopted in foreign countries that impose similar obligations

 item 1a risk factors 

you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties together with all other information in this annual report on form 10k any of the risk factors we describe below could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations and the market price of our common stock 

risks related to covid19 mrna1273 and our other vaccine candidates against the sarscov2 virus 

we may encounter difficulties producing shipping or successfully commercializing our covid19 vaccine consistent with our existing or potential contractual obligations including due to delays or difficulties experienced by our commercial partners 

in response to the global covid19 pandemic we are continuing to pursue the rapid manufacture distribution and clinical testing of our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 which is our only commercial product and source of product revenues we may encounter difficulties producing the vaccine on the timelines and in the quantities set forth in our existing or future supply agreements we may also be unsuccessful in entering into contracts for future sales of covid19 vaccines our ability to commercialize an effective vaccine depends on our manufacturing capability both at our own manufacturing facility and those of our manufacturing partners which we rapidly scaled in response to the pandemic we are committing substantial financial resources and personnel to the development manufacture and distribution of our covid19 vaccine including to support the scaleup of manufacturing to enable our pandemic response which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs we may need to or the us government may require us to divert resources and capital from our other programs to the production of covid19 vaccines 

we do not have sufficient internal manufacturing infrastructure to support the global rollout of our covid19 vaccine on our own we have entered into strategic collaborations for the production as well as for commercial fillfinish manufacturing of our covid19 vaccine to supply markets both in and outside the united states we may need to engage additional collaborators in the future including contract manufacturing organizations cmos government and nongovernment organizations and other manufacturing partners to assist in meeting our capacity needs if we cannot enter into such arrangements on favorable terms or at all our ability to develop manufacture and distribute our covid19 vaccine would be adversely affected 

prior to 2020 we had not ramped up our organization for a commercial launch of any product and doing so during a pandemic with an urgent critical global need poses additional challenges such as setting up distribution channels building global teams with specialized skills and managing potential intellectual property disputes or challenges we may also face challenges sourcing a sufficient amount of raw materials to support the demand for our covid19 vaccine we may be unable to effectively create a supply chain for the vaccine to adequately support demand as we rely on our thirdparty collaborators being able to fulfill demand for example we have in the past and may in the future experience international shipping delays as our supply chain expands and grows more complex any capacity or production issues or delays experienced by our collaborators may cause us to fail to meet certain product volume or delivery timing obligations under our covid19 supply agreements furthermore we will require significant additional investment whether from our own capital resources or other sources of funding as we continue to expand our commercial launch efforts we cannot guarantee that any of these challenges and requirements will be met in a timely manner or at all 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive we may be unsuccessful in competing effectively in the market for existing products new treatment methods and new technologies including for covid19 vaccines 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of products for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target including covid19 vaccines and these institutions and competitors may have 

• greater financial technical manufacturing and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of products 

• more extensive experience in preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and in manufacturing marketing and selling products 

• multiple products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and 

• collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions 

we face intense competition with respect to our covid19 vaccine from other vaccines and treatments and our vaccine may not continue to compete favorably with existing or future products over two dozen covid19 vaccines have been authorized in various jurisdictions including those produced by astrazeneca johnson  johnson and pfizerbiontech and many more remain in development these vaccines or other treatments such as antiviral pills produced by pfizer and merck may prove to be safer more 

effective more convenient have fewer side effects be easier to ship or distribute or able to be developed at a lower cost than our vaccine these factors or the perception of these factors among others could lead to a competitor’s vaccine or other treatment to become the standard of care for covid19 have broader market acceptance or be more successfully commercialized the actual or perceived success or failure of other entities may adversely impact our ability to commercialize our covid19 vaccine 

we also will face competition from products that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of conditions we target for example we are developing a seasonal flu vaccine for which there is a welldeveloped market and we may be unsuccessful in developing a product or achieving market share we also may compete with products that are under development for the treatment of conditions we target which other products may be more effective safer less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively 

if we successfully develop and obtain approval for investigational medicines we will face competition based on many factors including the safety and effectiveness of our products relative to any alternative therapies the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration the timing and scope of regulatory approvals the availability and cost of manufacturing marketing and sales capabilities the price of any approved medicine reimbursement coverage and patent position 

our competitors may commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop and may benefit from strategic alliances with or funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies if our competitors are more successful in commercializing their products than we are our competitive position and business would be adversely affected competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our products if approved 

we may be delayed or prevented from receiving full regulatory approval of our covid19 vaccine in certain jurisdictions or for certain demographics 

efficacy effectiveness safety and immunogenicity data with respect to our covid19 vaccine as well as realworld evidence continue to accumulate further results from clinical trials as well as the experience of vaccinated individuals could show diminished protection compared to the results released to date as efficacy and antibody persistence wane over time additionally we may observe new more frequent or adverse events of greater severity in subjects participating in ongoing clinical trials or among those individuals vaccinated with our covid19 vaccine for example some studies have suggested that our vaccine may be associated with higher rates of myocarditis and pericarditis in young males compared to other covid19 vaccines unexpected safety issues could significantly damage our reputation and that of our mrna platform and lead to other issues including delays in our other programs the need to redesign our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources in addition the interpretation of the data from our clinical trials of our covid19 vaccine by the fda and other regulators may differ from our interpretation and such agencies may require us to conduct additional studies or analyses which may lead to delays in obtaining authorization for these medicines for example in october 2021 the fda requested that we explore a lower dosage for our covid19 vaccine in adolescents which extended the length of clinical trials in this population delaying potential authorization in the us these factors could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval of our covid19 vaccine in certain jurisdictions or for certain demographics 

the assays used to estimate the effectiveness of covid19 vaccines have only recently been developed and continue to evolve validation reports for these assays have been submitted for review to regulatory agencies results obtained in clinical studies of mrna1273 with later versions of these assays may be less positive than the results we have obtained to date moreover blood samples from people who have recovered from covid19 used to benchmark the level of antibodies produced by subjects receiving mrna1273 in clinical studies have been taken from a small number of people and may not be representative of the antibody levels in a broader population of people who have recovered from covid19 particularly as variant strains continue to emerge the future results in clinical studies of mrna1273 may not be as positive when compared to the antibody levels in other blood samples 

we may be unsuccessful in developing future versions of our covid19 vaccine to protect against variants of the sarscov2 virus or booster doses of our vaccine may not protect against such variants and a market for vaccines and boosters against these variants may not develop 

our original covid19 vaccine mrna1273 was developed based upon the genetic sequence of the sarscov2 virus that was first detected in wuhan china as the sarscov2 virus continues to evolve new strains of the virus or those that are already in circulation may prove more transmissible or cause more severe forms of covid19 disease than the predominant strains to date for example the omicron and delta variants have been observed to be more transmissible or contagious than previous variants there is a risk that mrna1273 will not be as effective in protecting against these or other future variant strains for example a standard twodose inoculation of mrna1273 appears to be less effective at neutralizing the omicron variant which emerged in november 2021 than against the ancestral strain of sarscov2 additionally administration of booster doses of our vaccine may prove to be 

ineffective or less effective than desired against certain variants we have several development candidates against variants of concern and may develop others in the future if these efforts are unsuccessful we are slower to develop variantspecific vaccines than competitors or these vaccine candidates prove less effective than competitors’ vaccines these shortcomings may lead to reputational harm loss of market share and adverse financial results it is also possible that we may expend significant resources adapting our covid19 vaccine or conducting clinical trials to protect against variants of the sarscov2 virus but that a market for this adapted vaccine does not develop or demand does not align with our projections or cost expenditures 

the regulatory pathway for covid19 vaccines is continually evolving and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges 

our covid19 vaccine has moved rapidly through the regulatory review and authorization and approval processes in the us and other jurisdictions the speed at which covid19 vaccines and therapeutics are being created and tested is atypical and evolving or changing plans or priorities within the fda or other regulatory authorities including changes based on new knowledge of covid19 and how the disease and new variants of the virus affect the human body may significantly affect the regulatory timeline for further authorizations or approvals for our covid19 vaccine including variantspecific versions of the vaccine we cannot anticipate or predict with certainty the timelines or regulatory processes that may be required for the authorization or approval of updated versions of our covid19 vaccine or vaccines that may be developed to fight against variants of the sarscov2 virus 

although we currently operate under an eua provided by the fda for mrna1273 for as a booster dose for adults 18 years and older at least five months after completing a primary series of the vaccine and as a third dose in immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age or older who have undergone solid organ transplantation the fda may revoke such authorization if it determines that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization and we cannot predict how long the eua will remain in place such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways 

the ema has made a positive recommendation for the administration of spikevax for children ages 6 to 11 in addition to the existing conditional marketing authorization from the ema for spikevax in adults and adolescents ages 12 and older although a conditional marketing authorization is a formal marketing authorization and covers all batches produced for the eu we are obliged to provide certain additional information and data by specified timelines as conditions of the authorization and the ema can take regulatory action if we fail to comply conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually however the ema may decide not to renew if new data emerges that shows the benefits of our vaccine do not continue to outweigh its risks the ema can suspend or revoke our authorization similar temporary emergency authorizations that we have received for mrna1273 could be revoked if the conditions for granting the authorization no longer apply any such revocation of the temporary authorization to distribute mrna1273 without receiving final approval to distribute the vaccine could adversely impact our ability to realize the full financial benefit of our existing or future supply agreements 

our ability to deliver our vaccine to customers may be curtailed by one or more government actions or interventions which may be more likely during a global health crisis such as the covid19 pandemic 

it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly diminish our rights or opportunities with respect to our covid19 vaccine limiting our economic prospects in the united states the defense production act of 1950 as amended the defense production act gives the us government rights and authorities that may directly or indirectly diminish such rights or economic opportunities our current and potential thirdparty service providers may be impacted by government entities potentially invoking the defense production act or other potential restrictions to all or a portion of services they might otherwise offer 

government entities imposing restrictions or limitations on our thirdparty service providers may require us to obtain alternative service sources for our covid19 vaccine or our vaccine candidates if we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements on satisfactory terms we will experience delays in the development or production of our covid19 vaccine and our vaccine candidates increased expenses and delays in distribution or commercialization of our covid19 vaccine or when and if approved our vaccine candidates 

in addition our supply contracts with the us government for our covid19 vaccine restrict our ability to export vaccine that is produced from our usdedicated supply chain to markets outside the united states prior to satisfying our delivery obligations to the us government furthermore governments have threatened to block or limit the export of covid19 vaccines manufactured in their territories in instances where manufacturers have been delayed or have not fully satisfied their delivery obligations to those governments governments of the jurisdictions in which we or our contract manufacturing partners produce our covid19 vaccine may impose export restrictions prohibiting us from delivering our covid19 vaccine to customers in other jurisdictions the imposition of export controls could severely and adversely impact our manufacturing activities commercial activities and financial results 

in addition during a global health crisis such as the covid19 pandemic where the spread of a disease needs to be controlled closed or heavily regulated national borders create challenges and potential delays in our development and production activities and may necessitate that we pursue strategies to develop and produce our vaccines and vaccine candidates within selfcontained national or international borders at potentially much greater expense and with longer timeframes for public distribution 

risks related to our pipeline product development and regulatory review 

preclinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially for a new class of medicines such as mrna and therefore our preclinical programs or development candidates may be delayed terminated or may never advance to the clinic any of which may have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

much of our pipeline is in preclinical development and these programs could be delayed or not advance into the clinic before we can initiate clinical trials for a development candidate we must complete extensive preclinical studies including indenabling good laboratory practice glp toxicology testing to support our planned inds in the united states or similar applications in other jurisdictions we must also complete extensive work on chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc activities including yield purity and stability data to be included in an ind submission cmc activities for a new class of medicines such as mrna require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our development candidates if we must produce new batches preclinical studies or clinical trials could be delayed we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies whether the fda or other regulators will accept the results or if the outcome of our preclinical testing studies and cmc activities will ultimately support the further development of our programs as a result we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit inds or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect if at all and we cannot be sure that submission of inds or similar applications will result in the fda or other regulators allowing clinical trials to begin 

clinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially with a new class of medicines such as mrna medicines clinical trials of our investigational medicines may be delayed and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate any of which could have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

clinical testing is expensive complex and lengthy and its outcome is inherently uncertain there is a high rate of attrition for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials and most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are never approved as products we may not be able to initiate may experience delays in or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators also may experience unforeseen events during or as a result of any clinical trials that we or they conduct that could delay or prevent us or them from successfully developing our investigational medicines and gaining approval from regulators delays or other events that might prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials include 

• regulators institutional review boards irbs or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site 

• we may experience delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on favorable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective contract research organizations cros 

• changes to the scale and site of our manufacturing could lead to significant delays or changes in our clinical trial designs 

• the outcome of our preclinical studies and our early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results 

• we may be unable to establish or achieve clinically meaningful endpoints for our studies 

• if we make changes to our investigational medicines after clinical trials have commenced which we have done in the past we may be required to repeat earlier stages or delay later stages of clinical testing 

• clinical trials of any investigational medicines may fail to show safety or efficacy or produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide or regulators may require us to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials or we may decide to abandon product development programs 

• preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many investigational medicines believed to have performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval 

• our investigational medicines or other medicines in the same class as ours may have undesirable side effects such as the immunogenicity of the lnps or their components the immunogenicity of the protein made by the mrna or degradation products any of which could lead to serious adverse events or other effects 

• administration of our lnps could lead to systemic side effects related to the components of the lnps and could contribute in whole or in part to one or more of the following immune reactions infusion reactions complement reactions opsonization reactions antibody reactions or reactions to peg 

• significant adverse events or other side effects could be observed in our trials including those involving dosing of young human subjects with an investigational medicine 

• our thirdparty contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or withdraw from the trial which may require that we add new clinical trial sites 

• regulators may impose a complete or partial clinical hold on a trial or we or our investigators irbs or ethics committees may elect to suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to an unacceptable benefitrisk ratio 

• regulators may impose a complete or partial clinical hold on clinical trials of other companies working on mrna medicines 

• the cost of preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and clinical trials of any investigational medicines may be greater than we anticipate 

• the supply or quality of our investigational medicines or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate 

• safety and efficacy concerns regarding one or more of our investigational medicines will be considered by us and by the fda and other global regulators as we pursue clinical trials of new investigational medicines develop effective informed consent documentation and work with irbs and scientific review committees srcs 

• safety or efficacy concerns could arise from nonclinical or clinical testing of other therapies targeting a similar disease state or other therapies such as gene therapy that are perceived as similar to ours 

• adverse side effects could be observed in future clinical trials where our investigational medicines are administered in combination with other therapies such as the coadministration of our pcv investigational medicine mrna4157  and 

• a lack of adequate funding to continue a particular clinical trial 

the fda has indicated that prior to commencing laterstage clinical trials for our programs we will need to develop assays to measure and predict the potency of a given dose of our investigational medicines any delay in developing assays that are acceptable to the fda or other regulators could delay the start of future clinical trials additionally we have conducted and may conduct in the future clinical trials that utilize an “openlabel” trial design where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an approved drug or placebo the results from an openlabel trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results from a controlled environment with a placebo or active control further the fda or other regulators may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our investigational medicines could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do any delays in the development of our investigational medicines may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly 

there are risks that are unique to each of our programs and modalities and risks that are applicable across programs and modalities these risks may impair our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development obtain regulatory approval or ultimately commercialize our products or cause us to experience significant delays in doing so any of which may materially harm our business 

we have a large pipeline of development candidates and investigational medicines of which many are in clinical trials or have an open ind certain features in our development candidates and investigational medicines including those related to mrna chemical modifications surface chemistries lnps and their components may result in risks that apply to some or all of our programs and modalities as our development candidates and investigational medicines progress we or others may determine that certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient we made platformlevel technology mistakes individual programs or our mrna science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or underappreciated our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will result in an inability to manufacture our investigational medicines for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing or we have allocated resources in such a way that we cannot recover large investments or rapidly redirect capital 

we utilize earlier programs in a modality to understand the technology risks within the modality including manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties even if our earlier programs in a modality are successful in any phase of development any program may fail at a later phase of development and other programs within the same modality may fail at any phase of development including at phases where earlier programs in that modality were successful this may be a result of technical challenges unique to that program or due to biology risk which is unique to every program the biology risk across the majority of our pipeline represents targets and pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs and the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across the majority of our current and future programs 

as we progress our programs through clinical development new technical challenges may arise that cause an entire modality to fail additionally any portfolio spanning risks whether known or unknown if realized in any one of our programs would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our business as a whole 

there are also specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and our programs as a whole for example prophylactic vaccines typically require clinical testing in up to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefitrisk profile the need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even spurious safety findings negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch even if we observe positive safety tolerability and levels of immunogenicity in early clinical trials there can be no assurance that we will observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in laterstage trials required for approval of these programs 

for neoantigen cancer vaccines to date no molecular noncellbased therapeutic protein vaccine has been shown to be effective against cancer and there are many clinical and manufacturing challenges to personalized medicines including cellbased therapies and vaccines these risks include a rapid production turnaround time that is measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors the significant costs incurred in making individualized vaccines and potential lack of immune responses due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient these risks apply to our personalized cancer vaccine pcv and other neoepitope investigational medicine programs additionally there may be challenges in delivering an adequate quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient api required to drive efficacy due to the limitation in volume of api that can be delivered to a specific location like a tumor or injured tissue our investigational therapies for local injections often require specialized skills for conducting a clinical trial that could delay trials or slow or impair commercialization of an approved investigational medicine due to the poor adoption of injected local therapeutics or intratumoral therapies in addition the uncertain translatability of target selection from preclinical animal models including mouse and nonhuman primate models to successful clinical trial results may be impossible particularly for immunooncology and systemic therapies and cancer vaccines in general several biological steps are required for delivery of mrna to translate into therapeutically active medicines these processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues potentially leading to variable levels of therapeutic protein variable activity immunogenicity or variable distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect gene therapies and mrnabased medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product eg the mrna or the delivery vehicle such as an lnp as well as against the encoded protein giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a side effect these risks apply to all of our programs including our systemic secreted therapeutics and systemic intracellular therapeutics modalities 

we may experience delays in identifying and enrolling participants in our clinical trials which would delay the progress of our investigational medicines and result in increased expenses 

identifying and qualifying trial participants for our clinical trials of our investigational medicines is critical to our success difficulties or delays in enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our investigational medicines and obtain regulatory approval of potential products 

we may be unable to identify recruit and enroll a sufficient number of trial participants or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a trial to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner as we did in our phase 3 clinical study of mrna1273 we may slow enrollment in a trial to focus on achieving greater diversity in the subject population patient and subject enrollment is affected by factors including 

• severity of the disease under investigation 

• complexity and design of the study protocol 

• size of the patient population 

• eligibility criteria for the study in question including agebased eligibility criteria limiting subject enrollment to adolescent or pediatric populations 

• proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective trial participants 

• availability of competing therapies and clinical trials including by third parties or our own clinical trials 

• patient referral practices of physicians 

• ability to monitor trial participants adequately during and after treatment 

• ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience 

• clinicians’ and trial participants’ perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the investigational medicine being studied in relation to other available therapies including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating 

• adverse results or other adverse safety signals in our trials or related to other investigational medicines and the resulting negative publicity which could discourage potential trial participants and their doctors from participating in our trials 

• in the case of our pcv the need to wait for the manufacture of the personalized drug product and 

• our ability to obtain and maintain participant informed consent 

we also have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators control the development of certain of our investigational medicines which may provide us limited or no ability to influence the enrollment rate of our clinical trials even if we or our strategic collaborators are able to enroll trial participants there is no guarantee that they will ultimately be dosed as part of or complete a clinical trial 

mrna drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel nature of this new class of medicines and the negative perception of the efficacy safety or tolerability profile of any investigational medicines that we or others develop could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business advance our investigational medicines or obtain regulatory approvals 

no mrna medicine has been granted full or conditional approval by the fda or other regulators other than covid19 vaccines successful discovery and development of mrna medicines by us or our strategic collaborators is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors many of which are beyond our or their control we constantly make business decisions and take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline including those related to mrna technology delivery technology and manufacturing processes which ultimately may be unsuccessful 

our mrna investigational medicines that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance experience delays in the clinic experience clinical holds or fail to reach the market for many reasons including 

• nonclinical or preclinical study or clinical trial results may show potential mrna medicines to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects or toxicities 

• adverse results in our clinical trials or in those of others developing similar products or adverse effects relating to mrna or our lnps may lead to negative publicity or delays in or termination of one or more of our programs 

• adverse events related to products that are perceived to be similar to mrna medicines such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs increased regulatory scrutiny decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our investigational medicines and less demand for any product that we may develop 

• the insufficient ability of our translational models to reduce risk or predict outcomes in humans particularly given that each component of our investigational medicines and development candidates may have a dependent or independent effect on safety tolerability and efficacy which may among other things be speciesdependent 

• manufacturing failures or insufficient supply of cgmp materials for clinical trials or higher than expected cost could delay or set back clinical trials or make mrnabased medicines commercially unattractive 

• changes that we make to optimize our manufacturing testing or formulating of cgmp materials could impact the safety tolerability and efficacy profile of our investigational medicines and development candidates 

• pricing or reimbursement issues or other factors that delay clinical trials or make any mrna medicine uneconomical or noncompetitive with other therapies 

• our large pipeline of development candidates and investigational medicines could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions other reportable negative clinical outcomes manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the fda or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs as well as our business as a whole 

• failure to timely advance our programs or a failure or delay in receiving necessary regulatory approvals due to among other factors slow or failure to complete enrollment in clinical trials withdrawal by trial participants from trials failure to achieve trial endpoints additional time requirements for data analysis data integrity issues preparation of a bla or the equivalent application discussions with the fda or ema a regulatory request for additional nonclinical or clinical data or safety formulation or manufacturing issues may lead to our inability to obtain sufficient funding 

• new legislation or regulations passed by us state or foreign governments in response to negative public perception of mrna medicines and 

• the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent our mrna medicines from being commercialized 

because we are developing some of our development candidates or investigational medicines for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and in some cases using new endpoints or methodologies the fda or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results 

there are no pharmacologic therapies approved to treat the underlying causes of many diseases that we currently attempt to address or may address in the future for instance for both mma and pa few clinical trials have been attempted and there are no approved drugs to treat these diseases as a result the design and conduct of clinical trials of investigational medicines for the treatment of these disorders and other disorders may take longer be more costly or be less effective due to the novelty of development in these diseases 

even if the fda does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful we may not achieve the prespecified endpoint to a degree of statistical significance in any pivotal or other clinical trials we or our strategic collaborators conduct further even if we do achieve the prespecified criteria our trials may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with the results of the more traditional efficacy endpoints in the trial the fda could give overriding weight to other efficacy endpoints over a primary endpoint even if we achieve statistically significant results on that endpoint if we do not do so on our secondary efficacy endpoints the fda also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks and may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of licensure regulators in other countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints 

some of our investigational medicines are classified as gene therapies by the fda and the ema the association of our medicines with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens impair the reputation of our investigational medicines or negatively impact our platform or our business 

there have been few approved gene therapy products in the united states or foreign jurisdictions and there have been wellreported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future and the implications for mrnabased therapies are unknown for example the fda has established the office of tissues and advanced therapies within its center for biologics evaluation and research cber to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products and convenes the cellular tissue and gene therapies advisory committee to advise cber on its review in the eu mrna has been characterized as a gene therapy medicinal product which falls within a broader category known as advanced therapy medicinal products atmps which are subject to additional regulatory requirements in certain countries mrna therapies have not yet been classified or any such classification is not known to us for example in japan the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency has not taken a position on the regulatory classification notwithstanding the differences between mrna medicines and gene therapies the classification of some of our mrna investigational medicines as gene therapies in the united states the eu and potentially other countries could adversely impact our ability to develop our investigational medicines negatively impacting our platform and our business for instance a clinical hold on gene therapy products may apply to our mrna investigational medicines irrespective of the differences between gene therapies and mrna 

adverse events reported with respect to gene therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs although our mrna development candidates and investigational medicines are generally designed not to make any permanent changes to cell dna regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies caused by introducing new dna and irreversibly changing the dna in a cell could also be a risk for our mrna investigational therapies and as a result may delay one or more of our trials or impose additional testing for longterm side effects any new requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory review agencies may negatively affect our business by lengthening the regulatory review process requiring us to perform additional or larger studies or increasing our development costs any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines or lead to significant postapproval studies limitations or restrictions as we advance our investigational medicines we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines if we fail to do so we may be required to delay or discontinue development of some or all of our investigational medicines 

additionally we have established moderna genomics mgx with the vision of becoming a leader in large complex genomic editing in november 2021 we announced a multiyear research collaboration with metagenomi to leverage metagenomi’s discovery platform and expertise to develop nextgeneration in vivo gene editing therapies our work in genomic editing is subject to all risks associated with gene therapies although there have been significant advances in recent years in fields of gene therapy and genome editing in vivo crisprbased genome editing technologies are relatively new and their therapeutic utility is largely unproven public perception and related media coverage of potential therapyrelated efficacy or safety issues as well as ethical concerns related specifically to genome editing may adversely influence the willingness of subjects to participate in clinical trials in addition any review conducted by an institutional biosafety committee may result in delay or prevent initiation of a gene therapy clinical trial 

additionally if any such therapeutic is approved physicians and patients may be slow or fail to accept these novel and personalized treatments physicians health care providers and thirdparty payors often are slow to adopt new products technologies and treatment practices particularly those that may also require additional upfront costs and training physicians may not be willing to undergo training to adopt these novel and potentially personalized therapies may decide the particular therapy is too complex or potentially risky to adopt without appropriate training and may choose not to administer the therapy further due to health conditions genetic profile or other reasons certain patients may not be candidates for the therapies in addition responses by federal and state agencies congressional committees and foreign governments to negative public perception ethical concerns or financial considerations may result in new legislation regulations or medical standards that could limit our ability to develop or commercialize any product candidates obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability based on these and other factors health care providers and payors may decide that the benefits of these new therapies do not or will not outweigh their costs 

a breakthrough therapy designation or fast track designation or accelerated approval by the fda or comparable pathways in other jurisdictions for a drug may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it would not increase the likelihood that the drug will receive marketing approval 

we have received fast track designation for some of our investigational medicines and may seek fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation for others the fda has broad discretion whether or not to grant either designation and the receipt of either designation for a drug may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures even if one or more of our investigational medicines qualify for fast track designation or as breakthrough therapies the fda may later decide that the investigational medicine no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for fda review or approval will not be shortened additionally even if we obtain accelerated approval in the united states or under comparable pathways in other jurisdictions we may face requirements and limitations that will adversely affect our prospects for example the fda generally requires preapproval of promotional materials for products receiving accelerated approval which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product further 

we may not receive ultimate approval or we may be approved only for a limited indication we may not successfully complete required postapproval trials such trials may not confirm the clinical benefit of our drug or approval of the drug may be withdrawn 

we may fail to obtain and maintain orphan drug designations for our investigational medicines 

we may file for orphan drug designation where available for our investigational medicines we may never receive such designation for any particular medicine although we have received orphan drug designation from both the fda and the european commission for pa mrna3927 and gsd1a mrna3745 orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process in addition exclusive marketing rights in the united states may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphandesignated indication or may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective further even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may be approved for the same condition and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity even after an orphandesignated product is approved the fda can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care 

our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway 

during the 12year period of exclusivity provided by the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 or bpci act  another company may still market a competing version of a product if the fda approves a bla for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials demonstrate the safety purity and potency of the other company’s product the bpci act is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty 

there is also a risk that any exclusivity we receive for an investigational medicine could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise or that the fda will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated other aspects of the bpci act some of which may impact the bpci act’s exclusivity provisions have also been the subject of recent litigation moreover the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing 

if we cannot obtain or are delayed in obtaining required regulatory approvals we will be unable to commercialize or will be delayed in commercializing investigational medicines we may develop 

any mrna medicine we may develop and the activities associated with its development and commercialization including design testing manufacture recordkeeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and comparable foreign regulators to obtain required regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe pure and potent in humans including the target population successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a bla to the fda a marketing authorization application maa to the ema and similar marketing applications to comparable global regulatory authorities for each investigational medicine and consequently the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any investigational medicines 

we have not received approval to market any investigational medicine other than our covid19 vaccine in any jurisdiction and our current or future development candidates or investigational medicines may never obtain regulatory approval  we have limited experience in filing and supporting the necessary applications for marketing approvals and may need to rely on thirdparty cros or 

regulatory consultants to assist us in this process although we expect to submit blas for our mrnabased investigational medicines in the united states other jurisdictions may consider our mrnabased investigational medicines to be new drugs not biologics and require different marketing applications preclinical studies and clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in another securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to and inspection of manufacturing facilities by the relevant regulatory authority any investigational medicines we develop may be ineffective only moderately effective or have undesirable or unintended side effects toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use 

additionally the process of obtaining marketing approvals both in the united states and abroad is expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors including the type complexity and novelty of the investigational medicines involved changes in marketing approval policies during the development period changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may delay the review of an application the fda and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical clinical or other studies in addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing approval of an investigational medicine additional delays or nonapproval may result if an fda advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends nonapproval or restrictions on approval 

the fda and other regulators review the cmc section of regulatory filings any aspects found unsatisfactory by regulatory agencies may result in delays in clinical trials and commercialization in addition the regulatory agencies conduct preapproval inspections at the time of a bla any findings by regulatory agencies and failure to comply with requirements may lead to delay in approval and failure to commercialize the potential investigational medicine 

if we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any investigational medicines we may develop the commercial prospects for those investigational medicines will be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired 

our products are and any future products will be subject to regulatory scrutiny 

even if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction the applicable regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly postapproval studies or postmarket surveillance for example the holder of an approved bla is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the bla the holder of an approved bla must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product product labeling or manufacturing process advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws in addition regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our investigational medicines 

if we our contract manufacturers or other strategic collaborators fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our investigational medicines a regulatory agency may issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines suspend or withdraw regulatory approval or revoke a license suspend any ongoing clinical trials refuse to approve a pending bla or supplements to a bla submitted by us seize or recall investigational medicines or products or refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts including government contracts 

any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and generate negative publicity the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize any approved products and generate revenues 

additionally the fda or other regulators could require us to adopt a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy for any approved investigational medicine to ensure that the benefits of treatment outweigh the risks for each potential patient which may include among other things a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients a communication plan to health care practitioners extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry furthermore if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop several potentially significant negative consequences could result including the suspension or withdrawal of approvals and licenses the addition of warning labels changes to the way a product is administered the requirement to conduct further clinical trials lawsuits or increased liability for harm to patients and their children and reputational harm any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any products we develop and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

even though the moderna covid19 vaccinespikevax has been approved by the fda for individuals 18 years of age and older in the united states it remains the subject of regulatory scrutiny for example we are required to conduct postmarketing studies to further assess the risks of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with spikevax additionally we have committed to conducting additional postmarketing safety studies including conducting a pregnancy registry study to evaluate pregnancy and infant outcomes after receipt of spikevax during pregnancy we or others could identify previously unknown side effects or known side effects could be observed as being more frequent or severe than in clinical studies or earlier postmarketing periods in which case 

• sales of mrna1273 may be more modest than originally anticipated 

• the fda and other regulatory agencies may revoke authorizations for the vaccine 

• we may decide or be required to conduct recalls or send field alerts to physicians pharmacists and hospitals 

• additional nonclinical or clinical studies changes in labeling or changes to manufacturing processes specifications andor facilities may be required and 

• government investigations or lawsuits including classaction lawsuits may be brought against us 

any of the above occurrences could reduce or prevent sales of our covid19 vaccine increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize the vaccine 

risks related to the manufacturing of our commercial products development candidates investigational medicines and our future pipeline 

our mrna products including our covid19 vaccine development candidates and investigational medicines are based on novel technologies and are complex and difficult to manufacture we or our thirdparty manufacturers may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping for any of our medicines 

the manufacturing processes for our medicines including our covid19 vaccine are novel and complex no mrna medicine other than covid19 vaccines has been commercialized to date due to the novel nature of mrna technology and our limited experience at larger scale production we and our collaborators have experienced and may continue to encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping these issues could be due to many reasons including complexities of producing batches at larger scale equipment failure human error choice and quality of raw materials and excipients analytical testing technology and product instability further mrna medicines encapsulated in lnps must be developed and manufactured under wellcontrolled conditions or pharmacological activity can be adversely impacted 

in an effort to optimize product features we have in the past and may in the future make changes to our development candidates or investigational medicines in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions this has in the past and may in the future result in our having to resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply insufficient stability or shelf life of our development candidates and investigational medicines could materially delay our or our strategic collaborators’ ability to continue the clinical trial for that development candidate or investigational medicine or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product due to the need to manufacture additional preclinical or clinical supply 

our rate of innovation is high which has resulted in and will continue to cause a high degree of technology change that can negatively impact product comparability during and after clinical development furthermore technology changes may drive the need for changes in modification to or the sourcing of new manufacturing infrastructure or may adversely affect thirdparty relationships 

in many cases we may need to utilize multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the clinical supply requirement of a single clinical trial failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials or in the commercialization of any approved product for example the changes we make as we continue developing new manufacturing processes for our drug substance and drug product may impact specification and stability of the drug product and may lead to failure of batches resulting in a substantial delay in delivery of commercial product or conduct of our clinical trials our mrna investigational medicines may prove to have a stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved mrna medicine this poses risk in supply requirements wasted stock and higher cost of goods 

we are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology further we have developed our own custom manufacturing equipment for certain of our medicines if we encounter unexpected performance issues with such equipment we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply due to the number of different programs we may have cross contamination of investigational medicines inside of our factories cros suppliers or in the clinic that affect the integrity of our investigational medicines 

as we scale the manufacturing output for commercial production and particular programs we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our commercial products development candidates and investigational medicines from 

indenabling studies through commercial launch including shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance because of continuous improvement in manufacturing processes we may switch processes for a particular program during development however after a change in process more time will be required for pharmaceutical property testing such as 6 or 12 month stability testing that may require resupplying clinical material or making additional cgmp batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed 

we are utilizing a number of raw materials and excipients that have a single source of supply are new to the pharmaceutical industry and are being employed in a novel manner some of these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures or supply shortages such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our investigational medicines 

we have established a number of analytical assays and may have to establish several more to assess the quality of our mrna investigational medicines we may identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall for example we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety efficacy or stability this may lead to an inability to release mrna investigational medicines until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified 

as our drug development pipeline increases and matures the increased demand for clinical and commercial supplies from our facilities and third parties may impact our ability to operate we rely on many service providers all of whom have inherent risks in their operations that may adversely impact our operations 

completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our vaccine candidates require access to or development of facilities to manufacture our vaccine candidates at sufficient yields and at commercialscale we have limited experience manufacturing any of our vaccine candidates in the volumes that are necessary to support largescale clinical trials or commercial sales efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling scaleup reproducibility yield purity cost potency or quality if we are unable to institute necessary controls related to product development manufacturing and quality our operations may be adversely impacted in addition other companies many with substantial resources compete with us for access to the materials needed to manufacture our vaccines 

we currently utilize and expect to continue to utilize third parties to among other things manufacture raw materials components parts and consumables and to perform quality testing if the field of mrna and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand we may encounter increasing competition for these materials and services demand for thirdparty manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity which could disrupt our ability to find and retain thirdparty manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials components parts and consumables required to manufacture our mrna investigational medicines the use of service providers and suppliers could expose us to risks including but not limited to 

• termination or nonrenewal of supply and service agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us 

• disruptions to the operations of these suppliers and service providers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations including the bankruptcy of the supplier or service provider and 

• inspections of thirdparty facilities by regulatory authorities that could have a negative outcome and result in delays to or termination of their ability to supply our requirements 

our reliance on thirdparty manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control because of contractual restraints and the limited number of thirdparty manufacturers with the expertise required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines on a commercial scale replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and timeconsuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine a thirdparty manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production including 

• difficulties with production costs scale up and yields 

• availability of raw materials and supplies 

• quality control and assurance 

• shortages of qualified personnel 

• compliance with strictly enforced regulations that vary in each country where products might be sold and 

• lack of capital funding 

any delay or interruption could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

we are subject to operational risks associated with the physical and digital infrastructure at both our internal manufacturing facilities and at those of our external service providers 

our mtc facility in norwood massachusetts incorporates a significant level of automation of equipment with integration of several digital systems to improve efficiency of operations our high level of digitalization may pose risk of process equipment malfunction and even overall manufacturing system failure or shutdown due to internal or external factors including but not limited to design issues system compatibility or potential cybersecurity breaches 

our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers may also be subject to intentional attacks or acts of sabotage by outside actors contractors or employees any disruption in our or our contract manufacturers’ manufacturing capabilities could cause delays in production capacity for our drug substances or products or a shutdown of facilities could impose additional costs or may require us to identify qualify and establish an alternative manufacturing site the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as we expand our development and commercial capacities we have and expect that we will continue to establish additional manufacturing capabilities inside the mtc footprint and that we will expand to other locations and geographies such as africa australia and canada this expansion may lead to regulatory delays or prove more costly than anticipated if we fail to select a suitable location complete construction in an efficient manner engage effectively with local regulators recruit the required personnel and generally manage our growth effectively the development and production of commercial products or our investigational medicines could be delayed or curtailed we expect that we will continue to make additional investments in our manufacturing processes as we expand the mtc and our other manufacturing infrastructure 

our products and investigational medicines are sensitive to shipping and storage conditions which in some cases requires coldchain logistics and subjects our investigational medicines to risk of loss or damage 

our covid19 vaccine and our investigational medicines are sensitive to temperature storage and handling conditions and we could lose medicines if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly shelf life for our products and investigational medicines is expected to be variable and our investigational medicines may expire prior to use coldchain logistics are required for certain of our investigational medicines and our covid19 vaccine if we or thirdparty distributors do not maintain effective coldchain supply logistics then we may experience an unusual number of returned or out of date products and critical batches of products may be rendered unusable this has in the past and could in the future lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials commercial sale or otherwise in addition the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of vendors could cause supply disruptions 

we are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing our covid19 vaccine and our mrna investigational medicines our manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers may not meet regulatory requirements failure to meet cgmp requirements set forth in regulations promulgated by the fda ema and other global health authorities could result in significant delays in any approval of and costs of our products 

the manufacturing of medicines for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation and components of such products must be manufactured in accordance with cgmp requirements which are enforced in the case of the fda in part through its facilities inspection program the regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures including record keeping and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of products and materials used in clinical trials poor control of the cgmp production processes can lead to product quality failures that can impact our ability to supply product resulting in cost overruns and delays to clinical timelines which could be extensive such production process issues include but are not limited to 

• critical deviations in the manufacturing process 

• facility and equipment failures 

• contamination of the product due to an ineffective quality control strategy 

• facility contamination as assessed by the facility and utility environmental monitoring program 

• raw material failures due to ineffective supplier qualification or regulatory compliance issues at critical suppliers 

• ineffective product stability 

• ineffective corrective actions or preventative actions taken to correct or avoid critical deviations due to our developing understanding of the manufacturing process as we scale and 

• failed or defective components or consumables 

regulatory authorities typically require representative manufacturing site inspections to assess adequate compliance with cgmp and manufacturing controls if we or one of our thirdparty manufacturing sites fails to provide sufficient quality assurance or control the product approval to commercialize may not be granted inspections by regulatory authorities may occur at any time during the 

development or commercialization phase of products the inspections may be product specific or facility specific for broader cgmp inspections or as a follow up to market or development issues that the regulatory agency may identify deficient inspection outcomes may negatively impact the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations impacting or delaying supply or delaying programs 

the manufacturing process for our covid19 vaccine and for any other products that we may develop is subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority approval process if we or our thirdparty manufacturers are unable to reliably produce products or investigational medicines to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities we or our strategic collaborators may not obtain or maintain the approvals needed to commercialize such products even if regulatory approval is obtained for any of our mrna medicines there is no assurance that either we or our cmos will be able to manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials increase clinical trial costs delay approval of our investigational medicines impair commercialization efforts or increase our cost of goods which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control quality assurance and qualified personnel our contract manufacturers supply or manufacture materials or products for other companies and their failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements may generally affect the regulatory status of their facilities in addition to the extent that we rely on foreign contract manufacturers including for our covid19 vaccine we are subject to additional risks including the need to comply with import and export regulations additionally our potential future dependence on others to manufacture our investigational medicines and raw materials may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis 

the fda the ema and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time in some cases regulators may prohibit us from distributing a lot or lots until it authorizes release deviations in the manufacturing process including those affecting quality attributes and stability may cause unacceptable changes in the product resulting in lot failures or product recalls our thirdparty contract manufacturers have experienced lot failures and one has experienced a product recall related to our covid19 vaccine lot failures have in the past caused and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own or our thirdparty manufacturers’ facilities could cause us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product launches which could harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we and our manufacturing partners also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes and operations or those of our manufacturing partners which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements additionally we may not be able to control for or ultimately detect intentional sabotage or negligence by any employee or contractor 

our pcv investigational medicine is uniquely manufactured for each patient using a novel complex manufacturing process and we may encounter difficulties in production 

we custom design and manufacture pcvs that are unique and tailored specifically for each patient manufacturing unique lots of pcvs is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with 

• logistics associated with the collection of a patient’s tumor blood or other tissue sample 

• shipping such samples to a facility for genetic sequencing 

• next generation sequencing of the tumor mrna 

• identification of appropriate tumorspecific mutations 

• the use of a software program including proprietary and open source components which is hosted in the cloud and a part of our investigational medicine to assist with the design of the patientspecific mrna which software must be maintained and secured 

• effective design of the patientspecific mrna that encodes for the required neoantigens 

• batch specific manufacturing failures or issues that arise due to the uniqueness of each patientspecific batch 

• quality control testing failures 

• unexpected failures of batches placed on stability 

• shortages or quality control issues with singleuse assemblies consumables or critical parts sourced from thirdparty vendors that must be changed out for each patientspecific batch 

• significant costs associated with individualized manufacturing that may adversely affect our ability to continue development 

• successful and timely manufacture and release of the patientspecific batch 

• shipment issues encountered during transport of the batch to the patient site of care and 

• the ability to define a consistent safety profile at a given dose when each participant receives a unique vaccine 

we have built and installed custom manufacturing equipment for pcvs that has been incorporated into a personalized vaccine unit in the mtc this equipment may not function as designed resulting in deviations in the drug product produced which could lead to increased batch failure and the inability to supply patients enrolled in the clinical trial if our clinical development plans are expanded due to the custom nature of the equipment and singleuse assemblies we may require significant investments in addition it would take considerable time to scale up our facilities or build new facilities to meet any commercial demand if our pcv product is approved this expansion or addition of new facilities could also lead to product comparability issues which could further delay introduction of new capacity 

because our pcvs are manufactured for each individual patient we are required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient’s tissue sample sequence data derived from such tissue sample results of analysis of such patient’s genomic analysis and the custom manufactured product for each patient maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex and failure to do so has in the past and may in the future result in product mix up adverse patient outcomes loss of product or regulatory action including withdrawal of any approved products from the market further as our pcv is developed through earlystage clinical trials to laterstage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection analysis manufacture and delivery process will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results these changes may not achieve the intended objectives and any of these changes could cause our pcvs to perform differently than we expect potentially affecting the results of clinical trials 

risks related to our reliance on third parties 

we are dependent on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and the processes required to develop our products development candidates and investigational medicines 

we depend on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and manufacturing processes required to develop and commercialize our covid19 vaccine development candidates and investigational medicines we cannot ensure that these suppliers will remain in business have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that will cease working with us our use of singlesource suppliers exposes us to several risks including disruptions in supply price increases or late deliveries any disruption in supply from any singlesource supplier could lead to supply delays or interruptions that would damage our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

there are in general relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components if we have to switch to a replacement supplier the manufacture and delivery of our products development candidates or investigational medicines could be interrupted for an extended period which could adversely affect our business establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our products or investigational medicines if required may not be accomplished quickly if at all any replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval resulting in further delay any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner could impair our ability to meet the demand for our investigational medicines additionally as part of the fda’s approval of our investigational medicines the fda will review the individual components of our process which include the manufacturing processes and facilities of our singlesource suppliers 

we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into strategic alliances with third parties for the development and commercialization of our and their products development candidates and investigational medicines if these strategic alliances are not successful our business could be adversely affected 

we have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators have provided and may in the future provide funding and other resources for developing manufacturing and commercializing our investigational medicines additionally as we have begun to generate revenue we have begun to enter into strategic alliances where we agree to provide funding and other resources to third parties we expect to enter into additional strategic alliances in the future our existing strategic alliances and any future strategic alliances we enter into may pose a number of risks including the following 

• strategic collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected 

• the clinical trials conducted as part of such strategic alliance may not be successful 

• strategic collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any investigational medicines that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization of programs based on clinical trial results changes in the strategic collaborators’ focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that divert resources or create competing priorities 

• strategic collaborators may delay clinical trials provide insufficient funding for clinical trials stop a clinical trial abandon an investigational medicine repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of an investigational medicine for clinical testing 

• strategic collaborators could develop independently or with third parties products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or investigational medicines if such collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours 

• products or investigational medicines developed in strategic alliances with us may be viewed by our strategic collaborators as competitive with their own investigational medicines or products which may cause strategic collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our investigational medicines 

• a strategic collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products or investigational medicines that achieve regulatory approval may commit insufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product 

• disagreements with strategic collaborators including over proprietary rights contract interpretation or the course of development of any investigational medicines may cause delays or termination of the research development or commercialization of such investigational medicines lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such investigational medicines or result in litigation or arbitration any of which would be timeconsuming and expensive 

• strategic collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our ip rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our ip or proprietary information 

• disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of ip developed pursuant to our strategic alliances 

• strategic collaborators may infringe the ip rights of third parties exposing us to potential litigation and liability 

• future relationships may require us to incur nonrecurring and other charges increase our near and longterm expenditures issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business 

• we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators and the negotiation process is timeconsuming and complex and 

• our international operations through any future collaborations acquisitions or joint ventures may expose us to certain operating legal and other risks not encountered in the united states 

our strategic collaborators generally may materially amend or terminate their agreements with us for convenience which has happened in the past if any collaboration agreement is terminated we may not receive future research funding or milestone earnout royalty or other contingent payments and the development of our investigational medicines may be delayed it may also be difficult to attract new strategic collaborators to continue development or commercialization of the applicable investigational medicine and the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected all of the risks relating to product development regulatory approval and commercialization described in this annual report on form 10k apply to the activities of our strategic collaborators 

we may seek to establish additional strategic alliances and if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans certain of our strategic alliance agreements may restrict our ability to develop certain products 

our development programs and the potential commercialization of our development candidates and investigational medicines will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses we may collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of some of our investigational medicines and we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators our ability to establish additional strategic alliances will depend among other things on our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed strategic alliance and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states the potential market for the subject investigational medicine the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such investigational medicine to trial participants the potential of competing drugs the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally any potential strategic collaborator may ultimately collaborate on alternative investigational medicines or technologies for similar indications rather than collaborate with us 

we are also restricted under our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own these restrictions on working with targets polypeptides routes of administration and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with other collaborators or to pursue certain potentially valuable development candidates or investigational medicines 

strategic alliances are complex and timeconsuming to negotiate and document if we cannot negotiate and enter into new strategic alliances on a timely basis on favorable terms or at all we may need to curtail the development of the investigational medicine for which we are seeking to collaborate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and 

undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense we may need to obtain additional capital to fund these efforts and the inability to obtain such funding on favorable terms may prevent us from further developing our investigational medicines or bringing them to market and generating product revenue 

we rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our research preclinical studies protocol development and clinical trials for our development candidates and investigational medicines if these third parties do not perform satisfactorily comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our investigational medicines and our business could be substantially harmed 

we rely on third parties such as cros to help manage certain preclinical work and our clinical trials and on medical institutions clinical investigators and cros to assist in the design and review of and to conduct our clinical trials including enrolling qualified patients in addition we engage thirdparty contractors and collaborators to support numerous other research commercial and administrative activities which reduces our control over these activities but does not relieve us of our responsibilities such as ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its general investigational plan and protocols moreover the fda requires us to comply with glps and good clinical practices for conducting recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that in the case of clinical trials the rights integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected such standards will evolve and subject us and third parties to new or changing requirements 

if third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines we may need to replace them which could cause a delay of the affected clinical trial drug development program or applicable activity if clinical trials are not conducted in accordance with our contractual expectations or regulatory requirements action by regulatory authorities may significantly and adversely affect the conduct or progress of such trials or even require a clinical trial to be redone accordingly our efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for and commercialize our drug candidates could be delayed in addition failure of any thirdparty contractor to conduct activities in accordance with our expectations could adversely affect the relevant research development commercial or administrative activity 

risks related to our intellectual property 

if we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries or protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our ability to effectively compete using our development candidates will be harmed 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other ip laws of the united states and other countries so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information because certain us patent applications are confidential until the patents issue such as applications filed prior to november 29 2000 or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications in addition publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions including our covid19 vaccine for this and other reasons we may be unable to secure desired patent rights thereby losing exclusivity further we may be required to obtain licenses under thirdparty patents to market our proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities if licenses are not available to us on favorable terms we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities 

the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming and our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent applications may fail to result in valid enforceable patents or our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements if we or our present or future strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner our business may be adversely affected 

despite our and our strategic collaborators’ efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary while issued patents are presumed valid they may not survive a validity challenge and could be held unenforceable any patents we have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged invalidated adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by parties seeking to design around our ip also third parties or the uspto may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications any challenge to finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention of our patents or patent applications would be costly would require significant time and attention of our management could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from thirdparty licensors and could have a material adverse impact on our business 

the standards that the uspto and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change similarly the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions including ours in the united states and foreign countries remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices courts and lawmakers for example the america invents act which took effect in march 2013 included a number of changes to the patent laws of the united states if any of the enacted changes prevent us from adequately protecting our discoveries including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents to obtain injunctive relief or for substantial damages our business could be adversely affected one major provision of the america invents act changed us patent practice from a firsttoinvent to a firsttofile system if we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor’s filing date and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention there is also no uniform worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents in certain countries for example methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable 

accordingly we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others we also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets knowhow and technology which are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive position we also rely on nondisclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements entered into with our employees consultants and third parties if any trade secret knowhow or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

failure to obtain and maintain all available regulatory exclusivities and broad patent scope and to maximize patent term restoration or extension on patents covering our products may lead to loss of exclusivity and early biosimilar entry resulting in a loss of market share andor revenue 

in addition we may choose not to enforce our ip rights in certain circumstances or for certain periods of time for example in october 2020 we announced that while the covid19 pandemic continues we will not enforce our covid19related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic we also noted that to eliminate any perceived ip barriers to vaccine development during the pandemic period upon request we are also willing to license our ip for covid19 vaccines to others for the postpandemic period however we may never enter into such licenses of our ip for the postpandemic period and our business may be otherwise adversely impacted by our decision not to enforce this ip 

uncertainty over ip in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry has been the source of litigation and other disputes which is inherently costly and unpredictable and can have adverse financial and freedomtooperate consequences 

mrna medicines are a relatively new scientific field and as the field continues to mature patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world there is uncertainty about which patents will issue and if they do as to when to whom and with what claims it is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings such as patent infringement lawsuits interference reexamination and opposition proceedings as well as interpartes and postgrantreview proceedings introduced by provisions of the america invents act in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mrna field 

we have issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in key markets around the world that claim many different methods compositions and processes relating to the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of mrna medicines and our delivery technology including lnps an opposition has been filed against one of our european platform patents covering uridinemodified mrnas and we expect that further oppositions will be filed in the european patent office epo and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio in many cases the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents and it may be years before final unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions the timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims we cannot be certain that such patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form even if our rights are not directly challenged disputes could lead to the weakening of our ip rights 

there are many issued and pending thirdparty patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide and delivery technologies that we may need for our mrna therapeutic and vaccine candidates or marketed products including our covid19 vaccine there are also many issued thirdparty patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for mrna medicines we wish to develop for example there are issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party’s belief that we may need such patents for our mrna therapeutic candidates thus it is possible that one or more organizations hold patent rights to which we may need a license or which could be asserted against us if those organizations refuse to license such patent rights on reasonable terms or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have 

been asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms we may owe damages to such party and further may be unable to market products including our covid19 vaccine covered by such patents 

in certain instances we have instituted and may in the future institute inter partes review proceedings against issued us patents and opposition proceedings against european patents owned by third parties in the field of mrna medicines we have a number of these proceedings ongoing against thirdparty patents related to rna vaccinations and mrna delivery if we are unsuccessful in invalidating such thirdparty patents those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against investigational medicines that obtain regulatory approval including our covid19 vaccine as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued the risk increases that our development candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties 

if we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights we could incur substantial costs and expenses substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts 

there may be thirdparty patents or patent applications with claims to materials formulations methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our investigational medicines and third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization in addition third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our investigational medicines any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself the holders of any such patents may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such investigational medicine unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire similarly if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations processes for manufacture or methods of use including combination therapy the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable investigational medicine unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires 

defense of infringement and other claims regardless of their merit would involve substantial litigation expense and divert employee resources from our business in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement pay royalties redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms if at all or may require substantial time and expense 

in addition any such licenses are likely to be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us if we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability which could jeopardize our ability to sustain our operations moreover we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our ip may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior ip positions in the relevant fields which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations 

in addition in connection with certain license and strategic alliance agreements we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to ip rights or the subject matter of the agreements the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to ip rights even if resolved in our favor could be substantial and litigation would divert our management’s efforts some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research development and commercialization efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations 

if thirdparty owners of any patent rights that we license do not properly or successfully obtain maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we may become a party to licenses that give us rights to thirdparty ip that is necessary or useful for our business in such a case our success may depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed ip our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications we license even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications our licensors may fail to maintain these patents may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would without protection for the ip we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects in addition we sublicense our rights under various thirdparty licenses to our strategic collaborators any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our strategic alliance agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our strategic collaborators 

if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license ip rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

we license ip which involves complex legal business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry we are a party to certain ip license agreements and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future our existing license agreements impose and we expect that future license agreements will impose various diligence milestone payment royalty and other obligations on us if we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or we are subject to a bankruptcy the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license and may be subject to additional liabilities 

in certain cases we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology in the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution we may incur significant liability to our strategic collaborators disputes may arise regarding ip subject to a licensing agreement including 

• the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretationrelated issues 

• whether our technology and processes that are not subject to the licensing agreement infringe on ip of the licensor 

• the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships 

• our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations 

• the ownership of inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of ip by our licensors and us and our strategic collaborators and 

• the priority of invention of patented technology 

if disputes over ip that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected development candidates or investigational medicines we are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of ip that we license as we are for ip that we own if we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this ip our ability to commercialize products could suffer 

we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 

we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors from time to time we are subject to claims that we or our employees consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed ip including trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties including our employees’ former employers litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights or personnel which could adversely impact our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other ip 

we may be and have been subject to claims that former employees collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other ip ownership disputes may arise for example from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our development candidates litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights including exclusive ownership of or right to use valuable ip such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management and other employees and could impact or patenting strategy 

changes in us patent and regulatory law could impair our ability to protect our products 

our success is heavily dependent on ip particularly patents obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity and the process is costly timeconsuming and inherently uncertain in addition the united states has enacted and is implementing wideranging patent reform legislation recent us supreme court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations these rulings have increased uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future as well as with respect to the value of patents once obtained depending on decisions by the us congress the federal courts and the uspto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future see “—risks related to the research development regulatory review and 

approval of our existing and future pipeline—our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway” 

we may not be able to protect our ip rights throughout the world 

filing prosecuting and defending patents on development candidates and investigational medicines in every country would be prohibitively expensive and our foreign ip rights can be less extensive than those in the united states in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ip rights to the same extent as us federal and state laws consequently we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the united states or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the united states or other jurisdictions competitors may use our technologies to develop their own products in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection or may export infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as in the united states these products may compete with our products 

many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending ip rights in foreign jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other ip protection particularly those relating to biotechnology products which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our ip rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the ip that we develop or license 

additionally many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties as a result in response to the covid19 pandemic it is possible that certain countries may take steps to facilitate compulsory licenses that permit the distribution of a covid19 vaccine in those countries in addition many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors in these countries the patent owner may have limited remedies which could materially diminish the value of the relevant patent rights if we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business our competitive position may be impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected 

our reliance on government funding and collaboration from governmental and quasigovernmental entities for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of development commercialization and production of any programs developed under those governmentfunded programs 

the development of our zika vaccine mrna1893 is funded by barda and our covid19 vaccine was developed in collaboration with niaid barda has agreed to fund the advancement of our covid19 vaccine to fda licensure contracts and grants funded by the us government and its agencies including our agreements funded by barda and darpa and our collaboration with niaid include provisions that reflect the government’s substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts including powers of the government to 

• terminate agreements in whole or in part for any reason or no reason 

• reduce or modify the government’s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party 

• claim rights including ip rights in products and data developed under such agreements 

• audit contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 

• suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 

• impose us manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements 

• suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government 

• control and potentially prohibit the export of products 

• pursue criminal or civil remedies under the false claims act false statements act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements and 

• limit the government’s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the us congress on a fiscalyear basis thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period 

we may not have the right to prohibit the us government from using certain technologies developed by us and we may not be able to prohibit thirdparty companies including our competitors from using those technologies in providing products and services to the 

us government the us government generally takes the position that it has the right to royaltyfree use of technologies that are developed under us government contracts 

in addition government contracts and grants and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions these requirements include for example 

• specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants 

• mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent 

• public disclosures of certain contract and grant information which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program and 

• mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements including labor standards nondiscrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements 

further under these agreements we are subject to the obligations to and the rights of the us government set forth in the bayhdole act of 1980 bayhdole act as a result the us government may have rights in certain inventions developed under these governmentfunded programs including a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us to grant exclusive partially exclusive or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that i adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention ii government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or iii government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations also referred to as “marchin rights” any exercise of the marchin rights by the us government could harm our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and prospects if the us government exercises such marchin rights we may receive compensation that is deemed reasonable by the us government in its sole discretion which may be less than what we might be able to obtain in the open market ip generated under a governmentfunded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources 

in addition the us government requires that any products embodying any invention generated through the use of us governmentfunding be manufactured substantially in the united states the manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the ip can show that it made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the united states or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible this preference for us manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with nonus manufacturers for products covered by such ip 

as an organization we are relatively new to government contracting and the related regulatory compliance obligations if we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts 

as a us government contractor we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the us government of our costs and performance on their contracts as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts based on the results of its audits the government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs we cannot assure you that future audits and reviews will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

risks related to the commercialization of our pipeline 

we have limited sales distribution and marketing experience and have only recently invested significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities if we cannot effectively establish such capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products or to help ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements our ability to generate revenues may be adversely affected 

our covid19 vaccine is our only commercial product and we are investing in the development of sales marketing distribution managerial and other nontechnical capabilities in and out of the united states both on our own and with others we may seek to enter into strategic alliances with other entities to utilize their marketing and distribution capabilities but may be unable to enter into agreements on favorable terms if at all if we rely on third parties to commercialize any approved product we will receive lower revenues than if we commercialized these products ourselves in addition we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of such third parties if our collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our products and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business 

the commercialization and distribution of our covid19 vaccine also subjects us to pharmacovigilance obligations under various regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions where our vaccine is distributed these regulations generally require us to collect process 

analyze and monitor safety data and to identify and evaluate adverse reactions to our vaccine as it is administered in those jurisdictions we partner with thirdparty organizations to assist us in collecting and processing this safety data as it is reported from healthcare providers vaccine recipients and others if we or these third parties cannot comply with relevant regulations including with respect to the timely processing of safety data we may be subject to sanctions increased costs and reputational harm or our authorizations to distribute our vaccine in the relevant jurisdiction may be revoked or curtailed there are a limited number of thirdparty service providers who are qualified and capable of providing pharmacovigilance services on a global basis and our inability to identify or contract with them may impede our commercial activities 

we compete with many companies that currently have extensive and wellfunded marketing sales and pharmacovigilance operations and we must also compete with such companies to recruit hire train and retain marketing and sales personnel we also incur expenses associated with hiring thirdparty contractors to assist in conducting local pharmacovigilance services without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform these functions we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 

the terms of certain of our supply agreements may require us to refund certain prepayments from customers of our covid19 vaccine if they reduce purchase commitments or if we fail to deliver the purchased volume 

some customers for our covid19 vaccine prepay us for a portion of the product payment for the vaccine doses that they expect to receive from us such prepayments can be substantial we are generally not required by our contracts to retain these prepayments in cash or otherwise and we generally use them to make capital expenditures and fund the manufacturing scaleup and commercialization of our vaccine under certain supply agreements if we fail to deliver a portion or all of the committed number of doses by a certain date or if we are unable to successfully obtain regulatory authorization or approval for the commercialization of the vaccine in the relevant jurisdiction a customer may reduce the volume of vaccine doses that it commits to purchase or terminate the contract upon termination we would generally be required to refund a portion of that customer’s prepayment we may not have the cash or other available resources to satisfy that repayment obligation in this situation our business financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected furthermore if customers do not prepay us for our services in the future we may have to find other sources of funding which may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms 

the commercial success of any current or future investigational medicine if approved will depend on the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community 

ethical social and legal concerns about genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use including new areas of research such as in gene editing additionally the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the medical community patients and thirdparty or governmental payors accepting mrna medicines and our products in particular as medically useful costeffective and safe the degree of market acceptance of our investigational medicines if approved for commercial sale will depend on numerous factors including 

• the potential efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments 

• the ability to offer our products if approved at competitive prices 

• the prevalence and severity of any side effects including any limitations restrictions including for use together with other medicines or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling 

• the prevalence and severity of any side effects resulting from checkpoint inhibitors or other products or therapies with which our products are coadministered 

• relative convenience and ease of administration 

• the willingness of the target patient population to try and physicians to prescribe new therapies 

• the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products 

• publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments and 

• sufficient thirdparty insurance coverage or reimbursement and patients’ willingness to pay outofpocket in the absence of thirdparty coverage or adequate reimbursement 

even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials market acceptance of the product will be unknown until after it is launched our efforts to educate the medical community and thirdparty payors on the benefits of the products may require significant resources especially due to the complexity and uniqueness of our programs and may never be successful 

we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

because we market our covid19 vaccine and plan to market other products if approved and to conduct manufacturing activities outside of the united states our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states we have limited experience as a company operating outside the united states we are not permitted to market or promote any of our developmental candidates or investigational medicines before we receive regulatory approval or other authorization from an applicable authority and we may never receive such approval for any of our developmental candidates or investigational medicines to obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements regarding safety and efficacy and governing among other things clinical trials manufacturing commercial sales pricing and distribution of our developmental candidates and investigational medicines and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions we are rapidly expanding our global operations establishing commercial subsidiaries and entering into arrangements to support the worldwide manufacture and distribution of our covid19 vaccine and other medicines including with third parties which is a complex task that we are undertaking on an accelerated timeline accordingly our business and financial results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors associated with our expanding global business including 

• efforts to develop an international commercial sales marketing and supply chain and distribution organization including efforts to mitigate longer accounts receivable collection times longer lead times for shipping and potential language barriers for example in the second half of 2021 we felt the impact of longer delivery lead times for international shipments and exports which shifted certain anticipated deliveries of our covid19 vaccine from 2021 to 2022 

• our customers’ ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets 

• our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties 

• different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political and cultural climate or economic condition including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• an increased legal and compliance burden to establish maintain and operate legal entities in foreign countries 

• the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory tax accounting and legal requirements including the european general data protection regulation 2016679 gdpr 

• the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute and the difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions and the existence of potentially relevant thirdparty ip rights 

• inadequate ip protection in foreign countries and the existence of potentially relevant thirdparty ip rights 

• tradeprotection measures including trade restrictions import or export licensing requirements such as export administration regulations promulgated by the us department of commerce and fines penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges the imposition of government controls and changes in tariffs 

• the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

we are also subject to extensive federal state and foreign antibribery regulations including the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and similar laws in other countries compliance with the fcpa is expensive and difficult particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem in addition the fcpa presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because in many countries hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to fcpa enforcement actions various laws regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside the united states or the sharing with certain nonus nationals of information classified for national security purposes as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products as we expand our presence outside the united states we will need to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws and these laws may preclude us from developing manufacturing or selling certain products and product candidates outside the united states which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs 

we cannot guarantee that we or our employees consultants or thirdparty contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption moreover our strategic collaborators and thirdparty contractors outside the united states may have inadequate compliance programs or fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate which may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting the sec also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on us exchanges for violations of the fcpa’s accounting provisions even if we are not determined to have violated these laws government investigations typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity which could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations 

sales of pharmaceutical products depends on the availability and extent of reimbursement from thirdparty payors and changes to such reimbursement may materially harm our business prospects operating results and financial condition 

thirdparty payor coverage and reimbursement for our covid19 vaccine is not currently available and there is no guarantee payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for the vaccine in the future even if coverage is provided we may not be able to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment while coverage is expected to be provided under medicare part b it is unclear to what extent other payors including certain federal entitlement programs such as the vaccines for children program will provide coverage for the product additionally it is uncertain whether any combination respiratory vaccine we develop if approved would qualify for coverage under medicare part b 

in addition sales of pharmaceutical products in general depends to a significant extent on adequate coverage pricing and reimbursement from thirdparty payors when a new product is approved the availability and extent of government and private reimbursement and the pricing for that product may be uncertain pricing and reimbursement for any product we develop may be adversely affected by a number of factors including 

• changes in and implementation of federal state or foreign government regulations or private thirdparty payors’ reimbursement policies 

• pressure by employers on private health insurance plans to reduce costs and 

• consolidation and increasing assertiveness of payors seeking price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies and in some cases the imposition of restrictions on access or coverage of particular drugs or pricing determined based on perceived value 

our ability to set the price for any product we develop will vary significantly from country to country our inability to obtain and maintain adequate prices in a particular country may limit the revenues from our products within that country and adversely affect our ability to secure acceptable prices in existing and potential new markets which may limit market growth this may create the opportunity for thirdparty crossborder trade or influence our decision to sell or not to sell a product thus adversely affecting our geographic expansion plans and revenues 

drug prices are under significant scrutiny in many countries we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis competition may negatively impact our ability to maintain pricing and our market share new products marketed by competitors could cause our revenues to decrease due to potential price reductions and lower sales volumes additionally the introduction of competing versions of our products or products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways may reduce the price that we are able to charge for our products and lower our sales volume 

many payors continue to adopt benefit plan changes that shift a greater portion of prescription costs to patients including more limited benefit plan designs higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and limitations on patients ’ use of commercial manufacturer copay payment assistance programs significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and pharmacy benefit managers exerting greater pressure in pricing and usage negotiations with drug manufacturers significantly increasing discounts and rebates required of manufacturers and limiting patient access and usage further consolidation among insurers pharmacy benefit managers and other payors would increase the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other drug manufacturers additional discounts rebates coverage or plan changes restrictions or exclusions as described above could have a material adverse effect on sales of our affected products coverage and reimbursement by a thirdparty payor may depend upon a number of factors including the thirdparty payor’s determination that use of a product is a covered benefit under its health plan safe effective and medically necessary appropriate for the specific patient costeffective and neither experimental nor investigational 

additionally target patient populations for some of our investigational medicines including for rare genetic diseases may be small and some of our investigational medicines like pcv require individual customization the pricing and reimbursement of our medicines if approved must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure if we cannot obtain adequate levels of reimbursement we may be unable to successfully market and sell our investigational medicines the manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our investigational medicines eg for administration of our product to patients is also important inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products 

our failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage pricing or reimbursement for our products could have an adverse effect on our business reputation revenues and results of operations 

recent federal legislation and actions by federal state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the united states including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the united states which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

we may face competition in the united states for our development candidates and investigational medicines if approved from therapies sourced from foreign countries with price controls on pharmaceutical products for example in october 2020 the fda published a final rule that would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from canada where there are government price controls since the issuance of the final rule several industry groups filed federal lawsuits requesting injunctive relief to prevent the rule from taking effect and challenging multiple aspects of the final rule this litigation has not progressed and the market implications are currently unknown but legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs if enacted could decrease the price we receive for any products we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and potential profitability 

healthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business 

in the united states federal and state legislatures health agencies and thirdparty payors continue to focus on containing the cost of health care legislative and regulatory proposals enactments to reform health care insurance programs and increasing pressure from social sources could significantly influence the manner in which our products if approved are prescribed and purchased for example provisions of the aca have resulted in changes in the way health care is paid for by both governmental and private insurers including increased rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs the requirement that manufacturers participate in a discount program for certain outpatient drugs under medicare part d and the expansion of the number of hospitals eligible for discounts under section 340b of the phsa see the section titled business—government regulation—current and future healthcare reform legislation 

we may face uncertainties as a result of efforts to repeal substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the aca there is no assurance that the aca as currently enacted or as amended in the future will not adversely affect our business and financial results and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business 

there is increasing public attention on the costs of prescription drugs and there have been and are expected to continue to be legislative proposals to address prescription drug pricing which could have significant effects on our business these actions and the uncertainty about the future of the aca and healthcare laws may put downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs 

there is also significant economic pressure on state budgets including as a result of the covid19 pandemic that may result in states increasingly seeking to achieve budget savings through mechanisms that limit coverage or payment for drugs in recent years some states have considered legislation and ballot initiatives that would control the prices of drugs including laws to allow importation of pharmaceutical products from lower cost jurisdictions outside the united states and laws intended to impose price controls on state drug purchases state medicaid programs are increasingly requesting manufacturers to pay supplemental rebates and requiring prior authorization by the state program for use of any drug for which supplemental rebates are not being paid government efforts to reduce medicaid expenses may lead to increased use of managed care organizations by medicaid programs this may result in managed care organizations influencing prescription decisions for a larger segment of the population and a corresponding limitation on prices and reimbursement for our products if approved 

in the eu and some other international markets the government provides health care at low cost to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices patient eligibility or reimbursement levels to control costs for the governmentsponsored health care system many countries have announced or implemented measures and may in the future implement new or additional measures to reduce health care costs to limit the overall level of government expenditures these measures vary by country and may include among other things patient access restrictions suspensions on price increases prospective and possible retroactive price reductions and other recoupments and increased mandatory discounts or rebates recoveries of past price increases and greater importation of drugs from lowercost countries these measures may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 

if the market opportunities for our programs development candidates or investigational medicines are smaller than we believe they are or we are unable to successfully identify clinical trial participants our revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer 

we focus certain of our research and product development activities on treatments for severe rare genetic diseases where the patient populations are difficult to ascertain or small additionally we expect to initially seek approval of our pcv and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines for use by patients with relapsed or refractory advanced disease ie the populations the fda often approves new therapies for initially if any such medicines prove to be sufficiently beneficial we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy there is no guarantee that our investigational medicines even if approved would be approved for earlier lines of therapy and prior to any such approvals we may have to conduct additional clinical trials 

our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases as well as the subset of those who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our investigational medicines are based on our beliefs and estimates these estimates have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature surveys of clinics patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect further new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases the number of trial participants both in and outside the united states may be lower than expected and potential clinical trial participants or patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our investigational medicines or products or new clinical trial participants or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business even if we obtain significant market share for our products if approved because the potential target populations are small we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit or stolen versions of mrna products or the unauthorized donation or resale of mrna products could have a negative impact on our financial performance or reputation 

third parties could illegally distribute and sell especially online counterfeit versions of mrna products that do not meet the rigorous cgmp manufacturing and testing standards counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and could be lifethreatening counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances or the wrong dose however to distributors and users counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version 

reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit products increased levels of counterfeiting or unsafe mrna products could materially affect patient confidence in our mrna products it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit or other nonmrna products will mistakenly be attributed to our mrna products in addition thefts of inventory at warehouses plants or while intransit which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity in mrna products as a result of counterfeiting theft or improper manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

further the unauthorized donation or resale of our product could adversely affect our ability to sell in a particular territory and have other adverse effects on our business results of operations and financial condition 

risks related to our finances 

we have a limited history of recognizing revenue from product sales and may not be able to achieve or maintain longterm sustainable profitability 

before the year ended december 31 2021 we incurred net losses in each year since our inception other than for our covid19 vaccine we have not completed pivotal clinical trials for any of our programs and it may be years for most of our investigational medicines if ever before we or our strategic collaborators have a product ready for commercialization our ability to generate revenue and maintain profitability depends on our ability alone or with strategic collaborators to successfully complete the development of and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our products and investigational medicines including commercializing our covid19 vaccine which is subject to numerous risks 

we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine and our clinical and preclinical development activities we may not be able to achieve or maintain longterm sustainable profitability and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations 

we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we 

• continue or expand our research or development of our programs in preclinical development 

• initiate additional preclinical clinical or other studies for our development candidates and investigational medicines including under our strategic alliance agreements 

• continue to invest in our platform to conduct research to identify novel mrna technology improvements including to identify methods of mrna delivery such as improvements to our lnps 

• change or add to internal manufacturing capacity or capability or additional manufacturers or suppliers 

• add additional infrastructure to our quality control and quality assurance groups to support our operations as we progress our investigational medicines toward commercialization 

• attract and retain skilled personnel 

• create additional infrastructure to support our product development and planned future commercialization efforts including new sites in the united states and abroad 

• seek marketing approvals and reimbursement for our investigational medicines 

• establish a sales marketing and distribution infrastructure to commercialize any products 

• acquire or inlicense other development candidates investigational medicines and technologies 

• make milestone or other payments under any inlicense agreements and 

• experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our financing or funding ability as well as negatively impact our ability to exist as a standalone company 

our financial condition and operating results have varied in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control as such a periodtoperiod comparison of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance in any particular quarter our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following as well as other factors described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

• our ability to manufacture and deliver supply of our covid19 vaccine 

• variations in our financial results development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us 

• delays or failures in advancement of existing or future development candidates into the clinic or investigational medicines in clinical trials 

• the feasibility of developing manufacturing and commercializing our programs 

• the outcomes of research programs clinical trials including any adverse safety events or other product development or approval processes conducted by us and our strategic collaborators 

• the timing of disclosure of any milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators or competitors 

• our ability to consistently manufacture our development candidates and investigational medicines 

• our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner and 

• our ability to obtain protect and enforce our ip rights as well as our knowhow and technologies 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 176 billion in cash cash equivalents and investments which are subject to general credit liquidity market inflation and interest rate risks we may realize losses in the fair value of these investments in addition if our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us our interest income would suffer these and other market risks associated with our investment portfolio may adversely affect our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

risks related to our business and operations 

we may encounter difficulties in managing the development and expansion of our company which could disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 2700 fulltime employees and in connection with the growth and advancement of our pipeline and commercialization of our company we expect to increase the number of employees and the scope of our operations to manage such development and expansion including internationally we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities and recruit and train qualified personnel our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its daytoday activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities 

we are pursuing development candidates and investigational medicines in many therapeutic areas and across a wide range of diseases successfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory and manufacturing pathways to all of these therapeutic areas and diseases requires significant depth of talent resources and corporate processes in order to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas we may not be able to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel this may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure give rise to operational mistakes loss of business opportunities loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees the physical expansion of our operations including the construction of the moderna science center in cambridge the expansion of our norwood campus and the construction of manufacturing facilities overseas may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of our investigational medicines if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion our expenses may increase more than expected our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy our future financial performance and our ability to 

commercialize our covid19 vaccine or our other investigational medicines if approved and compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company 

our failure to upgrade and maintain our enterprise resource planning system erp could adversely impact our business and results of operations 

we are working to upgrade our global erp system to support our anticipated future growth and expansion as a commercial operation we expect to incur substantial costs in implementing our erp system and a ny disruptions or difficulties in implementing or using our erp system could adversely affect our controls resulting in harm to our business including our ability to forecast or make sales and collect our receivables s ignificant delays in documenting reviewing and testing our internal control could cause us to fail to comply with our sec reporting obligations related to our management ’ s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting moreover such disruptions or difficulties could result in unanticipated costs and diversion of management attention 

our success depends on our ability to retain key employees consultants and advisors and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel 

our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial scientific technical qualitycontrol manufacturing medical and commercial personnel we are highly dependent on members of our management and scientific teams each of our executive officers and employees including key scientists and clinicians are employed “at will” meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time the loss of any of these persons’ services may adversely impact the achievement of our research development financing and commercialization objectives we do not have “key person” insurance on any of our employees several of our key employees including members of our executive team have been with us for a long period of time and have valuable fully vested stock options or other longterm equity incentives we may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry particularly in cambridge massachusetts 

in addition we rely on consultants contractors and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development regulatory approval manufacturing and commercialization strategies these individuals may be employed by other employers and may have commitments under contracts with others that may limit their availability to us the loss of the services of one or more of our current employees or advisors might impede the achievement of our research development regulatory approval manufacturing and commercialization objectives in addition we have flexibly grown our workforce through the use of contractors and part time workers if we cannot retain the services of such personnel we could experience delays in the operation of our business 

competition for skilled personnel including in mrna and lnp research clinical operations regulatory affairs therapeutic area management and manufacturing is intense and the turnover rate is high we may be unable to attract and retain personnel on favorable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for individuals with similar skill sets in some instances failure to attract and retain personnel could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with regulatory requirements in addition adverse publicity failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel we may also be unable to attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing professionals to support our covid19 vaccine and any future products the inability to recruit or loss of services of certain executives key employees consultants or advisors may impede the progress of our research development and global commercialization objectives and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we cannot maintain our corporate culture we could lose the innovation teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success and our business may be harmed 

we invest substantial time and resources in building and maintaining our culture and developing our personnel however as we continue to expand it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture throughout the covid19 pandemic much of our workforce has worked remotely and we implemented remote hiring and onboarding programs to facilitate significant hiring during 2021 in a remote work environment the dramatic growth of our workforce coupled with shifts in workplace and workstyle increase the risk of our ability to maintain culture any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic plans 

our internal computer systems and physical premises or those of third parties with which we share sensitive data or information may fail or suffer security breaches which could materially disrupt our product development programs and manufacturing operations 

our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators vendors contractors consultants or regulatory authorities with whom we share sensitive data or information are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses unauthorized access natural disasters which may become more frequent in the future as a result of climate change terrorism cybersecurity threats war and telecommunication and electrical failures we have experienced and may experience in the future cyberattacks on our information technology systems by threat actors of all types including nation states criminal enterprises individual actors andor advanced persistent threat groups in addition we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors if any such cyberattack or physical intrusion were to cause interruptions in our operations such as a material disruption of our development programs or our manufacturing operations or due to a loss of any of our proprietary information it would have a material and adverse effect on us for example the loss of clinical trial data from one or more clinical trials could cause delays in our regulatory approval efforts and increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data in addition because we run multiple clinical trials in parallel any breach of our computer systems or physical premises may result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across many of our programs in many stages of development our cybersecurity liability insurance may not cover all damages we would sustain based on any breach of our computer security protocols or cybersecurity attack 

any data breach security incident loss or compromise of personal information including any clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties or claims for damages either under the gdpr and relevant member state law in the eu other foreign laws and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the united states including the california consumer privacy act the ccpa we have from time to time received information that companies working on vaccine research and development may be a particular focus for those planning cyberattacks for example on may 13 2020 the federal bureau of investigation fbi and cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa announced that the fbi was investigating the targeting and compromise of us organizations conducting covid19related research by people’s republic of china or prcaffiliated cyber actors furthermore on july 16 2020 the national security agency and other us and foreign agencies released a joint cybersecurity advisory regarding the russian intelligence services’ targeting of covid19 research and vaccine development to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information including but not limited to information related to the research and manufacturing of our covid19 vaccine andor other vaccines we could incur liability our competitive and reputational position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our investigational medicines could be delayed with respect to potential liability for breaches involving personal information the ccpa is of particular concern since it provides for a private right of actions for certain personal information breaches 

we may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or investigational medicine and fail to capitalize on programs or investigational medicines that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success 

we pursue and fund the development of selected research programs or investigational medicines and may choose to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other programs or investigational medicines that could later prove to have greater commercial potential for example we have focused a significant amount of resources on our covid19 vaccine since the commencement of the covid19 pandemic our resource allocation decisions or our contractual commitments to provide resources to our strategic collaborators may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities our spending on current and future research and development programs for investigational medicines may not yield commercially viable products if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular investigational medicine we may relinquish valuable rights to that investigational medicine through a strategic alliance licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such investigational medicine or we may allocate internal resources to an investigational medicine in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a strategic alliance 

if we are not successful in discovering developing and commercializing additional products beyond our current portfolio our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired 

a key element of our strategy is to discover develop and potentially commercialize additional products beyond our current portfolio to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas we intend to do so by investing in our own drug discovery efforts exploring potential strategic alliances for the development of new products and inlicensing technologies identifying new investigational medicines requires substantial technical financial and human resources we may fail to identify promising investigational medicines and even if we do identify such medicines we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize products for many reasons including 

• competitors may develop alternatives that render our investigational medicines obsolete 

• investigational medicines we develop may be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights 

• an investigational medicine may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria 

• we may be incapable of producing an investigational medicine in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost or at all and 

• an approved product may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients the medical community or thirdparty payors 

if we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional products our potential for growth may be impaired 

our business could be harmed if we suffer damage to our reputation including as a result of a product recall 

the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of certain commercialized products in the case of the fda the authority to require a recall of a biologic product must be based on an fda finding that a batch lot of other quantity of the biologic product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health in addition foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of any investigational medicine in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture manufacturers may under their own initiative recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found a governmentmandated or voluntary recall by us or our strategic collaborators could occur as a result of manufacturing errors design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues as occurred with the recall of certain batches of our covid19 vaccine shipped to japan that were found to contain foreign particulate recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales our reputation could be further impacted by public discourse regarding our business and the perception of our business strategy 

product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any product or investigational medicine that we may develop such as our covid19 vaccine 

we are exposed to product liability risk related to the development testing manufacturing and marketing of our covid19 vaccine and our investigational medicines in clinical trials product liability claims and related crossclaims and claims for indemnification may be brought against us by patients healthcare providers or others using prescribing selling or otherwise coming into contact with our covid19 vaccine or investigational medicines for example we may be sued if the covid19 vaccine or any investigational medicine allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials manufacturing or if approved marketing sale or commercial use if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims we could incur substantial liabilities 

we could also face product liability claims relating to the worsening of a patient’s condition injury or death alleged to have been caused by one of our covid19 vaccine or investigational medicines any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing defects in design a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs knowledge of risks negligence strict liability and a breach of warranties claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts such claims might not be fully covered by product liability insurance if we succeed in marketing products including our covid19 vaccine product liability claims could result in an fda investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used suspension or withdrawal of approvals or license revocation regardless of the merits or eventual outcome liability claims may result in decreased demand for our products injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention costs to defend the related litigation withdrawal of clinical trial participants loss of revenue a diversion of management’s time and our resources substantial monetary awards to trial participants patients or their family members payments to indemnify clinical trial sites and other clinical trial partners and a decline in our stock price 

we are also exposed to liabilities that are unique to developing and commercializing an mrna vaccine during an ongoing global pandemic although the us and certain foreign governments have contractually agreed to indemnify us or make statutory immunity available to us such indemnification or statutory immunity may not be available to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from the research development manufacture distribution or commercialization of our covid19 vaccine additionally other foreign government that we contract with in the future may not provide us with similar contractual indemnity or statutory immunity substantial claims arising from the vaccine outside the scope of or in excess of us or foreign government indemnity or statutory immunity could harm our financial condition and operating results moreover any adverse event or injury for which we are liable even if fully covered under an indemnity or immunity could negatively affect our reputation 

we may not be able to maintain our product liability insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability while our current insurance program includes coverage for the sale of commercial products for when we obtain marketing approval for our medicines we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amoun ts on occasion large judgments have been awarded in individual mass tort and classaction lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and could adversely affect our results of operations and business 

if the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future our operating results could be materially adversely affected likewise if insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers additionally even if we maintain insurance coverage for a type of liability a particular claim may not be covered if it is subject to a coverage exclusion or we do not otherwise meet the conditions for coverage if we operate our business with inadequate insurance we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we are subject directly or indirectly to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws and false claims laws if we cannot comply or have not fully complied with such laws we could face substantial penalties 

healthcare providers physicians and thirdparty payors in the united states and elsewhere play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of pharmaceutical products arrangements with thirdparty payors and customers can expose pharmaceutical manufacturers to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which such companies sell market and distribute pharmaceutical products in particular the promotion sales and marketing of healthcare items and services as well as a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion structuring and commissions certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements are subject to extensive laws designed to prevent fraud kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion structuring and commissions certain customer incentive programs and other business arrangements generally activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of patient recruitment for clinical trials see the section entitled “ business—government regulation—other healthcare laws ” 

the scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities is time and resourceconsuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business if our operations are found to violate any of these laws or any other regulations that apply to us we may be subject to significant sanctions including civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment reputational harm exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance furthermore if any physician or other healthcare provider or entity with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to similar penalties any action for violation of these laws even if successfully defended could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business in addition the approval and commercialization of any product candidate we develop outside the united states will subject us to foreign healthcare laws 

the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the eu and the uk the provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is also governed by the national antibribery laws of eu member states and the uk bribery act 2010 in the uk infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment the eu directive 200183ec as amended governing medicinal products for human use provides that where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them no gifts pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy this provision has been transposed into the human medicines regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the uk despite its departure from the eu 

payments made to physicians in certain eu member states must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians often are the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization or the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

we are subject to various and evolving laws and regulations governing the privacy and security of personal data and our failure to comply could adversely affect our business result in fines andor criminal penalties and damage our reputation 

privacy and data security have become significant issues in the united states europe and in many other jurisdictions in which we operate andor collect personal information we are subject to data privacy and security laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that apply to the collection storage use sharing and security of personal data including health information and impose significant compliance obligations in addition numerous other federal and state laws including state security breach notification laws state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws govern the collection use disclosure and security of personal information the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues 

for example the gdpr has imposed stringent obligations on us with respect to our processing personal data and the crossborder transfer of such data including higher standards of obtaining consent more robust transparency requirements data breach notification requirements requirements for contractual language with our data processors and stronger individual data rights different eea member states have interpreted the gdpr differently and many have imposed additional requirements adding to the complexity of processing personal data in the eea the gdpr also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data to countries outside the eea that are not considered to provide “adequate” protection to personal data  including the united states and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations compliance with the gdpr is a rigorous and timeintensive process that may increase our cost of doing business or require us to change our business practices despite those efforts there is a risk that we may be subject to fines and penalties litigation and reputational harm in connection with any activities falling within the scope of the gdpr 

in the united states california has passed the california consumer privacy act and several other states and the federal government are actively considering proposed legislation governing the protection of personal data additionally brazil passed the general data protection law which went into effect in august 2020 data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges each law is also subject to various interpretations by courts and regulatory agencies creating additional uncertainty and our efforts to comply with the evolving data protection rules may be unsuccessful 

we must devote significant resources to understanding and complying with the changing landscape in this area failure to comply with data protection laws may expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by authorities private rights of action in some jurisdictions and potential significant penalties if we are found to be noncompliant failure to comply with the gdpr and applicable national data protection laws of eea member states could lead to substantial fines some of these laws and regulations also carry the possibility of criminal sanctions for example we could be subject to penalties including criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information from a hipaacovered health care provider or research institution that has not complied with hipaa’s requirements for disclosing such information furthermore the number of government investigations related to data security incidents and privacy violations continues to increase and government investigations typically require significant resources and generate negative publicity which could harm our business and our reputation 

the covid19 pandemic has added further complexity to the processing of personal data for example safety measures intended to protect our employees contractors and other visitors to our sites may require the collection of certain personal data our efforts to protect personal data may be unsuccessful and we could unintentionally be subject to unauthorized access or disclosure of such personal data 

the clinical trials regulation eu no 5362014 the clinical trial regulation and the ema policy on publication of clinical data for medicinal products for human use both permit the ema to publish clinical information submitted in maas the ability of third parties to review andor analyze data from our clinical trials may increase the risk of commercial confidentiality breaches and result in enhanced scrutiny of our clinical trial results such scrutiny could result in public misconceptions regarding our drugs and drug candidates these publications could also result in the disclosure of information to our competitors that we might otherwise deem confidential which could harm our business 

certain aspects of our business may be adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic 

certain of our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the ongoing covid19 pandemic resulting in paused enrollment or delayed site initiations site initiation participant recruitment and enrollment participant dosing distribution of clinical trial materials study monitoring and data analysis may be paused or delayed or continue to be paused or delayed due to changes in hospital or university policies federal state or local regulations or restrictions prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic efforts travel restrictions concerns for patient safety in a pandemic environment or other pandemicrelated reasons as the pandemic persists some participants and clinical investigators may be unable to comply with clinical trial protocols for example many countries have implemented quarantines or travel limitations whether voluntary or required which may impede participant movement affect sponsor access to study sites or interrupt healthcare services and we may be unable to conduct our clinical trials 

the covid19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt the united states’ healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from or materially delay the review andor approval by the fda and other regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials or product approvals which could materially delay our clinical trials for development candidates or our commercial efforts 

we utilize third parties to among other things manufacture raw materials components parts and consumables perform quality testing and ship our products we also manufacture our development candidates and investigational medicines and perform various services at our manufacturing facility certain of our thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers may encounter delays in providing their services in response to the covid19 pandemic if either we or any thirdparty manufacturers or third parties in the supply chain for materials used in the production of our covid19 vaccine development candidates or investigational medicines are adversely 

impacted by restrictions resulting from the covid19 pandemic our supply chain may be disrupted limiting our ability to manufacture our covid19 vaccine as well as investigational medicines for our clinical trials research and development operations and commercialization in addition delays and disruptions experienced by our strategic collaborators due to the covid19 pandemic could adversely impact the ability of such parties to fulfill their obligations which could affect the clinical development or regulatory approvals of development candidates and investigational medicines under joint control 

if we engage in acquisitions joint ventures or strategic collaborations this may increase our capital requirements dilute our stockholders cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 

we may complete acquisitions and collaborations including licensing or acquiring complementary products ip rights technologies or businesses any such acquisition joint venture or collaboration may entail numerous risks including 

• increased operating expenses and cash requirements 

• assimilation of operations ip and products including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel 

• the diversion of management’s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives 

• the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships 

• risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction including the prospects of that party and their existing products or investigational medicines and regulatory approvals and 

• our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs 

if we undertake acquisitions we may utilize our cash issue dilutive securities assume or incur debt obligations incur large onetime expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense moreover if we cannot locate suitable acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business may be impaired 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 

our stock price has been and is expected to continue to be subject to substantial volatility from december 7 2018 our first day of trading on the nasdaq global select market through december 31 2021 our stock has traded within a range of a high price of 49749 and a low price of 1154 per share since we began our development efforts with respect to our covid19 vaccine in early 2020 our stock has experienced pronounced and extended periods of volatility as a result of the volatility in our stock price our stockholders could incur substantial losses 

public statements by us government agencies the media competitors financial analysts or others relating to the covid19 pandemic and efforts to combat it have in the past resulted and may in the future result in significant fluctuations in our stock price given the global focus on the covid19 pandemic information in the public arena on this topic whether or not accurate has had and will likely continue to have an outsized impact positive or negative on our stock price information related to our clinical trials manufacturing regulatory and commercialization efforts with respect to our covid19 vaccine or information regarding such efforts by competitors or the evolution of the pandemic may meaningfully impact our stock price 

the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies as a result of this volatility you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price the market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors including 

• the success of our covid19 vaccine sales and anticipated product revenue 

• results of clinical trials of our investigational medicines or those of our competitors 

• the success of competitive products or technologies particularly vaccines or treatments for covid19 

• the emergence or decline of new or existing variants of the sarscov2 virus 

• commencement or termination of strategic alliances 

• regulatory or legal developments in the united states and other countries 

• developments or disputes concerning patent applications issued patents or other proprietary rights 

• the recruitment or departure of key personnel 

• expenses related to any of our products investigational medicines or clinical development programs 

• the results of our efforts to discover develop acquire or inlicense additional investigational medicines 

• actual or anticipated changes in estimates of financial results development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts 

• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us 

• changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems 

• market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors 

• general economic industry and market conditions 

• the numerous programs in our pipeline the development of which could each generate news or significant adverse events that could impact financial results or recommendations by securities analysts 

• announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments and 

• public announcements by us or our strategic collaborators regarding the progress of our development candidates or investigational medicines or similar public announcements by our competitors 

in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities classaction litigation often has been instituted against that company such litigation if instituted against us could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management’s attention and resources which could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations and prospects 

our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

as of february 18 2022 our executive officers directors and affiliated stockholders beneficially owned approximately 14 of our outstanding common stock in addition nonaffiliated five percent or greater stockholders beneficially owned approximately 25 of our outstanding common stock these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions for example if these stockholders were to act together they could exert significant influence over matters such as elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a hostile takeover or change in control of us or changes in our management our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that 

• authorize “blank check” preferred stock which could be authorized for issuance by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock 

• create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered threeyear terms 

• specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent 

• establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors 

• provide that our directors may be removed only for cause 

• provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office even though less than a quorum 

• specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors 

• expressly authorize our board of directors to modify alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws and 

• require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future capital appreciation if any will be your sole source of gain 

we do not currently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business or to return cash to shareholders through share repurchases in addition the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware or the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us 

pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf 2 any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders 3 any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors officers employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our amended and restated bylaws or 4 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the delaware forum provision the delaware forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the securities act or the exchange act our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the united states district court for the district of massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act the federal forum provision our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the delaware forum provision and the federal forum provision 

the delaware forum provision and the federal forum provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the state of delaware or the commonwealth of massachusetts as applicable additionally the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees even though an action if successful might benefit our stockholders while the delaware supreme court ruled in march 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the securities act be brought in federal court are “facially valid” under delaware law there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal forum provision the federal forum provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is unenforceable or invalid and if the federal forum provision is found to be unenforceable we may incur additional costs in resolving such matters the court of chancery of the state of delaware and the united states district court for the district of massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders 

general risk factors 

our employees principal investigators and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading 

we are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees principal investigators leading our clinical trials and consultants misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations or the regulations applicable in the eu and other jurisdictions provide accurate information to the fda the ema and other regulatory authorities comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the united states and abroad or report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the fda or other regulatory authorities which could result in regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other business arrangements it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take may be ineffective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 

unfavorable us or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets including by the covid19 pandemic or any other health epidemic the most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the most recent global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including weakened demand for our investigational medicines and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on favorable terms if at all a weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers possibly resulting in supply disruption or cause delays in payments for our services by thirdparty payors or our collaborators any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business 

employee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business 

our employees may from time to time bring lawsuits against us regarding injury creating a hostile workplace discrimination wage and hour disputes sexual harassment or other employment issues in recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses certain companies that have faced employment or harassmentrelated lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business any employmentrelated claim could negatively affect our business 

if we fail to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous and flammable materials and wastes including chemicals and biological materials we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these hazardous materials and waste products and we cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials 

in addition we may incur substantial costs to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 

changes in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

we are subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate the rules dealing with us federal state and local and nonus income taxation are constantly under review by legislative and tax authorities changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect us and our stockholders in recent years such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition or results of operations 

the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges 

social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research development candidates investigational medicines and the diseases our development candidates and investigational medicines are being developed to treat social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear this uncertainty creates risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business resulting in potential regulatory actions against us for example subjects may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event when such disclosures occur we may fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our development candidates and investigational medicines there is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations we could incur liability face regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business

overview 

we are a biotechnology company pioneering messenger rna mrna therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines to improve the lives of patients mrna medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular membrane or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mrna science delivery technology and manufacturing providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates we are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases independently and with our strategic collaborators in january 2022 the us food and drug administration fda approved the biologics license application bla for our covid19 vaccine spikevax for individuals 18 years of age and older in the united states spikevax is our first product to achieve licensure in the united states and it has been authorized for use or approved by regulators in more than 70 countries 

within our platform we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features we call that group a “modality” while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases they share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals and pharmaceutical properties programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk we have created seven modalities to date 

• prophylactic vaccines 

• systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics 

• cancer vaccines 

• intratumoral immunooncology 

• localized regenerative therapeutics 

• systemic intracellular therapeutics and 

• inhaled pulmonary therapeutics 

we have designated our prophylactic vaccines and systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modalities as our “core modalities” in these core modalities our strategy is to invest in additional development candidates using our accumulated innovations in technology our process insights and our preclinical and clinical experience our exploratory modalities continue to be a critical part of advancing our strategy to maximize the application of our potential mrna medicines 

since our founding in 2010 we have transformed from a researchstage company advancing programs in the field of mrna to a commercial enterprise with a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across seven modalities a broad intellectual property portfolio in areas including mrna and lipid nanoparticle formulation and an integrated manufacturing plant that allows for rapid clinical and commercial production at scale we have established relationships with a broad range of domestic and overseas government and commercial collaborators which has allowed for the pursuit of both groundbreaking science and rapid scaling of our manufacturing capabilities most recently our capabilities have come together to allow the authorization and approval of one of the earliest and mosteffective vaccines against the covid19 pandemic 

2021 business highlights 

moderna covid19 vaccine 

on december 18 2020 we received an emergency use authorization eua from the fda for the emergency use of the moderna covid19 vaccine also referred to as mrna1273 and marketed under the brand name spikevax in individuals 18 years of age or 

older subsequently we have also received authorization for our covid19 vaccine from health agencies in more than 70 countries and from the world health organization who additional authorizations are currently under review in other countries in addition we have received authorization for our covid19 vaccine for use in adolescents in the european union the united kingdom australia canada switzerland and other countries and have pending applications for authorization to administer the vaccine to adolescents with regulatory agencies in the united states and other countries in january 2022 we received full fda approval for spikevax to prevent covid19 in individuals 18 years of age and older in the united states 

a booster dose of our covid19 vaccine at the 50 µg dose level is authorized for use under an eua for adults 18 years and older a third dose of our covid19 vaccine at the 100 µg dose level is authorized for use under an eua in immunocompromised individuals 18 years of age or older in the united states who have undergone solid organ transplantation or who are diagnosed with conditions that are considered to have an equivalent level of immunocompromise the european medicines agency ema has also authorized a third dose of the moderna covid19 vaccine given at least 28 days after the second dose to severely immunocompromised individuals 12 years of age or older as well as the administration of 50 µg booster doses for individuals 18 years of age and older 

manufacturing scaling 

in 2021 we rapidly scaled our manufacturing capabilities for our covid19 vaccine by june we had delivered 200 million doses of the moderna covid19 vaccine to the us government by end of september we and our partners ramped up our capacity worldwide and supplied more than 500 million doses of our covid19 vaccine globally we took measures to scale capacity at a significant pace including the expansion of our moderna technology center mtc in norwood massachusetts by the end of 2021 we had shipped approximately 800 million doses of our covid19 vaccine worldwide 

in april 2021 we announced new funding commitments to increase supply at our owned and partnered manufacturing facilities we expect these investments will allow for a doubling of drug substance manufacturing at lonza’s switzerlandbased facility a more than doubling of formulation fill and finish and drug substance manufacturing at rovi’s spainbased facility as well as a 50 percent increase of drug substance at moderna’s facilities in the us when completed the investments are also expected to result in an increase in safety stock of raw materials and finished product used to deliver committed volumes 

access expansion 

we recognize that vaccine availability continues to be a challenge in many parts of the world and we remain focused on ensuring that lowincome countries have access to our vaccine in april we announced additional investments to increase global supply of our covid19 vaccine and in may we announced an agreement with gavi the vaccine alliance to supply up to 500 million doses of our vaccine at our lowest tiered price in line with our global access commitments this agreement has subsequently been revised to provide up to 650 million doses to be delivered across 2021 and 2022 

additionally in october we announced that moderna will build a stateoftheart mrna facility in africa with the goal of producing up to 500 million doses of vaccines each year at the 50 µg dose level we also announced the first step in our longterm partnership with the african union with a memorandum of understanding to supply up to 110 million doses of our covid19 vaccine to address the needs of lowincome countries in africa in january 2022 african union informed us that it will not exercise its option for 60 million doses in the second quarter of 2022 due to its expectation that existing supplies will be sufficient to meet its vaccination targets 

program development 

throughout the year we continued to build a diverse clinical portfolio of vaccines and therapeutics across our seven modalities our longstanding approach to portfolio development pursuing programs that have shared technology or biology has helped us reduce risk as our pipeline has grown to 40 programs in development including 23 in clinical studies as of december 31 2021 

beyond our covid19 vaccine in 2021 we launched the second pivotal trial in our company’s history with cmvictory a phase 3 study of our vaccine to prevent congenital cytomegalovirus cmv which is the number one cause of birth defects in the us this milestone takes us one step closer to potentially bringing another important vaccine to millions of people 

we are making other significant advances across our programs our seasonal influenza vaccine showed positive interim phase 1 data and our respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine moved to a phase 23 trial of 34000 participants in the fourth quarter of 2022 in oncology our personalized cancer vaccine phase 2 trial is now fully enrolled and we expect a readout as early as the fourth quarter of 2022 we also saw early positive data from the phase 2 study of our mrna vegfa therapeutic with astrazeneca moving it to the next stage of clinical development 

financial highlights 

we have entered into supply agreements with the us government other international governments gavi on behalf of the covax facility and the african union for the supply of our covid19 vaccine the agreements are generally subject to receipt of authorization or approval for the use and distribution of the vaccine from the relevant regulatory authority in each jurisdiction under these agreements we are entitled to upfront deposits for our covid19 vaccine supply which is initially recorded as deferred revenue as of december 31 2021 we had approximately 67 billion in deferred revenue in connection with the supply agreements with the us government and other customers which will be recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria have been met for the year ended december 31 2021 we delivered approximately 332 million doses of our covid19 vaccine to the us government and approximately 475 million doses to other governments and we recognized 177 billion in product sales 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash cash equivalents and investments of approximately 176 billion we are using this capital to fund operations and investing activities for technology creation drug discovery and clinical development programs infrastructure and capabilities to enable our research and early development activities which includes our mtc our digital infrastructure creation of our portfolio of intellectual property acquisition of key raw materials and supplies to support our commercial production quantities development of a commercial team expansion into global markets funding our strategic collaborations and administrative support we also use this capital to fund our share repurchase program designed to return value to our stockholders and minimize dilution from stock issuances 

other business updates 

in may 2021 we announced an expansion of our mtc the mtc has been core to our longterm strategy and has enabled us to provide the scale and flexibility to support the development of our mrna medicines and vaccines including our covid19 vaccine this investment will more than double the space at the mtc to approximately 650000 square feet and allow us to continue to optimize our mrna products as we explore new pharmaceutical delivery forms such as prefilled syringes and lyophilized products 

we are also investing in a new moderna science center msc in cambridge massachusetts to create a purposebuilt space to support our next chapter of discovery and serve as our principal executive offices the msc will integrate digitalfirst scientific research and development labs along with space for innovation and cocreation with our people and our partners around the world as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability the highperformance building is designed to be the most sustainable commercial lab building in cambridge 

in addition to our owned facilities in the us we have expanded our footprint across the globe with active subsidiaries in more than 12 countries including the us canada many european countries and the asia pacific region as moderna expands internationally we also announced in 2021 preliminary agreements with the governments of canada and australia to bring stateoftheart mrna manufacturing facilities to those countries to provide direct access to rapid pandemic response capabilities as well as domestically manufactured mrna vaccines against other diseases 

financial operations overview 

revenue 

the following table summarizes revenue for the periods presented in millions 



we began to record product sales for our covid19 vaccine subsequent to its authorization for emergency use by the fda and health canada in december 2020 for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 we recognized 177 billion and 200 million respectively of product sales from sales of our covid19 vaccine 

other than product sales our revenue in 2021 and 2020 was derived from governmentsponsored and private organizations including barda darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation and from strategic alliances with astrazeneca merck and vertex to discover develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines 

the following table summarizes grant revenue for the periods presented in millions 



the following table summarizes collaboration revenue for the periods presented in millions 



as of december 31 2021 we had signed supply agreements of approximately 206 billion for the future supply of our covid19 vaccine to be delivered in 2022 and 2023 and had deferred revenue of 67 billion associated with customer deposits received or billable under these agreements additional supply agreements have been agreed upon since december 31 2021 and others are under discussion for 2022 and 2023 deliveries we believe that the sarscov2 virus will evolve to an endemic phase in 2022 and as a result we expect our product sales to be larger in the second half of 2022 than in the first half 

in addition we expect to continue to receive funding from our contract with barda as of december 31 2021 the remaining available funding net of revenue earned was 189 million under the barda contract to the extent that existing or potential future products generate revenue our revenue may vary due to many uncertainties in future product demand the development of our mrna medicines and other factors 

cost of sales 

cost of sales includes raw materials personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing our commercial product these costs include production materials production costs at our manufacturing facilities thirdparty manufacturing costs and final formulation and packaging costs cost of sales also includes shipping costs royalties payable to third parties based on sales of our products and charges for inventory valuation reserves 

research and development expenses 

the nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs 

research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following 

• cost to develop our platform 

• discovery efforts leading to development candidates 

• preclinical nonclinical and clinical development costs for our programs 

• cost to develop our manufacturing technology and infrastructure and 

• digital infrastructure costs related to our drug discovery efforts and clinical trials 

the costs above comprise the following categories 

• personnelrelated expenses including salaries benefits and stockbased compensation expense 

• expenses incurred under agreements with third parties such as consultants investigative sites contract research organizations or cros that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and inlicensing arrangements 

• expenses associated with developing manufacturing capabilities and acquiring materials for preclinical studies clinical trials and prelaunch inventory including both internal manufacturing and thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations or cmos 

• expenses incurred for the procurement of materials laboratory supplies and noncapital equipment used in the research and development process and 

• facilities depreciation and amortization and other direct and allocated expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities 

we use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform and for discovering and developing programs due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are generally not recorded or maintained on a program or modalityspecific basis 

the following table reflects our research and development expenses including direct program specific expenses summarized by modality and indirect or shared operating costs summarized under other research and development expenses during the years ended december 31 2021 2020 and 2019 in millions 

 

1 includes a total of 37 development candidates at december 31 2021 and 21 development candidates at each of december 31 2020 and 2019 programspecific expenses include external costs and allocated manufacturing costs of prelaunch inventory mrna supply and consumables and are reflected as of the beginning of the period in which the program was internally advanced to development or removed if development was ceased 

a “modality” refers to a group of programs with common product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes the programspecific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs which consist primarily of external costs such as fees paid to outside consultants central laboratories investigative sites and cros in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials cmos and allocated manufacturing costs of prelaunch inventory mrna supply and consumables costs to acquire and manufacture prelaunch inventory mrna supply for preclinical studies and clinical trials are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred and subsequently allocated to programspecific manufacturing costs after completion of the programspecific production the timing of allocating manufacturing costs to the specific program varies depending on the program development and production schedule we generally do not allocate personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation costs associated with our general platform research technical development and other shared costs on a programspecific basis these costs were therefore excluded from the summary of programspecific expenses by modality 

discovery program expenses are costs associated with research activities for our programs in the preclinical discovery stage and primarily consist of external costs for cros and lab services and allocated manufacturing cost of preclinical mrna supply and consumables 

platform research expenses are mainly costs to develop technical advances in mrna science delivery science and manufacturing process design these costs include personnelrelated costs computer equipment facilities preclinical mrna supply and consumables and other administrative costs to support our platform research technology development and unallocated manufacturing expenses are primarily related to nonprogramspecific manufacturing process development and manufacturing costs 

shared discovery and development expenses are research and development costs such as personnelrelated costs and other costs which are not otherwise included in development programs discovery programs platform research technical development and unallocated manufacturing expenses stockbased compensation and other expenses 

the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities including development of our platform mrna technologies and manufacturing technologies we expense research and development costs as incurred and cannot reasonably estimate the nature timing and estimated costs required to complete the development of the development candidates and investigational medicines we are currently developing or may develop in the future there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development of such development candidates and investigational medicines including but not limited to 

• scope progress and expense of developing ongoing and future development candidates and investigational medicines 

• entry in and completion of related preclinical studies 

• enrollment in and completion of subsequent clinical trials 

• safety and efficacy of investigational medicines resulting from these clinical trials 

• changes in laws or regulations relevant to the investigational medicines in development 

• receipt of the required regulatory approvals and 

• commercialization including establishing manufacturing and marketing capabilities 

as we continue to pursue our indication expansion of mrna1273 during the current pandemic and continue to develop variantspecific covid19 vaccine candidates and our nextgeneration covid19 vaccine candidate mrna1283 we expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses at this time the magnitude of these potential expenditures is not known in connection with the barda agreement to accelerate development of mrna1273 grant revenue and expenses within the committed funding scope are expected to continue in 2022 barda’s funding is expected to offset those expenses that are covered under the barda agreement subject to our obtaining reimbursement from barda as of december 31 2021 the remaining available funding from barda net of revenue earned was 189 million please refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements 

changes in expectations or outcomes of any of the known or unknown risks and uncertainties may materially impact our expected research and development expenditures continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development such as our cmv vaccine mrna1647 and our covid19 vaccine generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase for the foreseeable future as our investigational medicines progress through the development phases and as we identify and develop additional programs there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our investigational medicines including future trial design and various regulatory requirements many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time due to the early stage of development of our investigational medicines moreover future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans 

selling general and administrative expenses 

we started to incur sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 to prepare for commercial operations in connection with the sale of our covid19 vaccine and these expenses increased throughout the course of 2021 selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation for executives finance legal human resources business development and other administrative and operational functions professional fees accounting and legal services information technology and facilityrelated costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property or ip these costs relate to the operation of the business unrelated to the research and development function or any individual program 

we anticipate selling general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand the number of programs in development and prepare for the establishment of commercial activities both within and outside the united states we have already incurred additional expenses related to building out a regulatory sales and marketing team to support the sale marketing and distribution of our covid19 vaccine and the expansion of our footprint across the globe with active subsidiaries in more than 12 countries if we obtain regulatory approval for additional investigational medicines and do not enter into one or more thirdparty 

commercialization collaboration and manufacturing arrangements we will incur significant additional expenses related to building out these functions 

we have a broad ip portfolio covering our development and commercialization of mrna vaccine and therapeutic programs including those related to mrna design formulation and manufacturing platform technologies we regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development we also hold trademarks and trademark applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions costs to secure and defend our ip are expensed as incurred and are classified as selling general and administrative expenses 

interest income 

interest income consists of interest generated from our investments in cash and cash equivalents money market funds and highquality fixed income securities 

other expense net 

other expense net consists of interest expense gains losses from the sale of investments in marketable securities and other income and expense unrelated to our core operations interest expense is primarily derived from our finance leases related to our moderna technology center and certain contract manufacturing service agreements 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions on an ongoing basis we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances facts and experience the effects of material revisions in estimates if any are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates 

while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our 

consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes based on an asset and liability approach we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized we consider future taxable income ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance we will reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made as of december 31 2021 we maintained a valuation allowance against a portion of the state deferred tax assets based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence 

we are subject to income tax audits and adjustments by tax authorities the nature of uncertain tax positions is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change which may be substantial we develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions and as additional information becomes available estimates are revised and refined we record reserves for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions these reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax expense 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

we have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations 

results of operations 

a discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 2020 is presented below a discussion regarding our results of operations for the year ended december 31 2020 compared to 2019 can be found under part ii item 7 of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2020 which was filed with the securities and exchange commission sec on february 26 2021 

the following tables summarize our consolidated statements of operations for the periods presented in millions 



revenue 

total revenue increased by 177 billion in 2021 primarily due to increases in product sales product sales increased by 175 billion in 2021 from sales of our covid19 vaccine to domestic and international government customers and international purchasing organizations such as gavi on behalf of the covax facility and the african union subsequent to the authorization by the fda and health canada for emergency use in december 2020 grant revenue increased by 206 million or 39 in 2021 mainly due to an increase in grant revenue from barda related to our covid19 vaccine development in 2021 

operating expenses 

cost of sales 

we began capitalizing our covid19 vaccine inventory costs in december 2020 in connection with an emergency use authorization from the fda and an interim order from health canada for use of our covid19 vaccine and based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of mrna1273 prior to the capitalization of our covid19 vaccine inventory costs costs related to our prelaunch inventory were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred we expensed 242 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020 

our cost of sales was 26 billion or 15 of our product sales in 2021 including thirdparty royalties of 641 million a portion of the inventory costs associated with our product sales for the year ended 2021 was expensed previously if inventory sold for the year ended 2021 was valued at cost including what was expensed as prelaunch inventory our cost of sales for the period would have been 28 billion or 16 of our product sales we utilized all of our prelaunch inventory during 2021 we expect that our cost of sales as a percentage of product sales will increase in 2022 due to higher manufacturing costs and lower average selling price per dose driven by the expected increase in deliveries to low income countries 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses increased by 621 million or 45 in 2021 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in clinical trial expenses of 721 million an increase in personnelrelated costs of 79 million and an increase in consulting and outside services of 59 million partially offset by a decrease in manufacturing expenses of 251 million attributable to prelaunch inventory expensed in 2020 prior to fda authorization the increase in 2021 was largely attributable to the continued clinical development of mrna1273 the increase in personnelrelated costs was primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees supporting our mrna1273 development activities as well as other research and development programs 

we expect that research and development expenses will increase in 2022 as we continue to progress our indication expansion of mrna1273 and continue to develop our pipeline and advance our product candidates into laterstage development in addition we also expect to incur significant costs related to the development of variantspecific covid19 candidates and our nextgeneration covid19 vaccine candidate mrna1283 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 379 million or 202 in 2021 the increase was mainly due to an increase in consulting and outside services of 97 million an increase in personnelrelated costs of 73 million an increase in marketing expense of 67 million an increase in distributor fees of 64 million and an increase in legal licensing and insurance expenses of 42 million the increases in personnelrelated costs and consulting and outside services were primarily attributable to mrna1273 commercializationrelated activities and increased headcount 

we expect that selling general and administrative expenses will increase in 2022 as we continue to build out our global commercial regulatory sales and marketing infrastructure to support the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine and continue to expand the number of programs and our business operations 

interest income 

interest income generated from our investments in marketable securities decreased by 7 million or 28 in 2021 mainly attributable to an overall lower interest rate 

other expense net 

the following table summarizes other expense net for the periods presented in millions 



total other expense net increased by 23 million or 383 in 2021 the increase was primarily due to losses related to remeasurements and our balance sheet hedging activities partially offset by gains on foreign currency transactions our interest expense is primarily related to our finance leases the increase in interest expense was driven by new finance leases that commenced in 2021 please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

provision for income taxes 

provision for income taxes increased by 11 billion in 2021 primarily due to an increase in pretax income our effective tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 was 81 which included tax benefits related to the release of the valuation allowance on most of our deferred tax assets foreignderived intangible income deduction and stockbased compensation provision for income taxes was immaterial for the year ended december 31 2020 we expect that our effective tax rate will increase in 2022 as the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets was mostly released in 2021 

liquidity and capital resources 

prior to the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine we have historically funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity instruments and from proceeds from certain strategic alliance arrangements and grant agreements starting in august 2020 we entered into supply agreements with the us government other international governments gavi and the african union for the supply of our covid19 vaccine under these agreements we are entitled to upfront deposits for our covid19 vaccine supply which are initially recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria have been met as of december 31 2021 we had 67 billion in deferred revenue related to customer deposits received or billable in addition we expect to continue to receive funding from our contract with barda related to our mrna1273 program as of december 31 2021 the remaining available funding net of revenue earned was 189 million 

as of december 31 2021 we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 176 billion cash cash equivalents and investments are invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation investments consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities are stated at fair value as of december 31 2021 we had current and noncurrent investments of approximately 39 billion and 68 billion respectively 

effective january 1 2022 research and development expenses are required to be capitalized and amortized for us tax purposes unless modified or repealed and based on current assumptions the mandatory capitalization would increase our cash tax liabilities 

we continue to work toward the largescale technical development manufacturing scaleup in several countries and larger scale deployment of our covid19 vaccine to support the scaleup we have expended and will need to continue to expend significant resources and capital 

cash flow 

the following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for the periods presented in millions 

operating activities 

we derive cash flows from operations primarily from cash collected from customer deposits related to our covid19 vaccine supply agreements as well as certain governmentsponsored and private organizations and strategic alliances our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business prior to 2020 we experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we invested in our mrna technologies development pipeline digital infrastructure manufacturing technology and infrastructure 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was 136 billion and consisted of net income of 122 billion and noncash adjustments of 110 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 13 billion noncash items primarily included depreciation and amortization of 232 million stockbased compensation of 142 million deferred income taxes of 318 million and amortization of investment premiums and discounts of 54 million the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of 28 billion an increase in accrued liabilities of 989 million an increase in income taxes payable of 876 million and an increase in accounts payable of 204 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 18 billion an increase in inventory of 14 billion and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 489 million

net cash used in operating activities in 2019 was 459 million and consisted of net loss of 514 million less noncash adjustments of 108 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 53 million noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 81 million and depreciation and amortization of 31 million the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of 44 million and a decrease in accounts payable of 24 million partially offset by an increase in operating lease liabilities noncurrent of 13 million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 10 million 

investing activities 

our primary investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of our investments and capital expenditures for manufacturing laboratory computer equipment and software 

net cash used in investing activities in 2021 was 85 billion which included purchases of marketable securities of 127 billion purchases of property and equipment of 284 million and investment in convertible notes of 30 million partially offset by proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 31 billion and proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 13 billion 

net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was 17 billion which included purchases of marketable securities of 30 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 68 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 11 billion and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 215 million 

net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was 15 million which included purchases of marketable securities of 11 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 32 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 993 million and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 169 million 

financing activities 

net cash used in financing activities in 2021 was 873 million primarily from repurchases of common stock of 857 million and changes in financing lease liabilities of 140 million partially offset by net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under our equity plans of 124 million 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was 20 billion primarily from net proceeds from equity offerings of 19 billion and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under our equity plans of 186 million 

net cash provided by financing activities in 2019 was 52 million primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchases under our equity plans of 51 million 

operation and funding requirements 

from our inception to the end of 2020 we incurred significant losses from operations due to our significant research and development expenses we generated net income for the year ended 2021 in connection with product sales following the authorization of our first commercial product we have retained earnings of 100 billion as of december 31 2021 we have significant future capital requirements including expected operating expenses to conduct research and development activities operate our organization meet capital expenditure needs and fund our share repurchase program we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities as we continue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines we also expect our expenses to increase associated with manufacturing costs including our arrangements with our international supply and manufacturing partners our ongoing work on mrna1273 including development of any new generations of boosters and vaccines against variants of sarscov2 and buildout of global commercial regulatory sales and marketing infrastructure to support the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine will require significant cash outflows during 2022 most of which may not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by our partners or collaborators in addition we have substantial facility lease and purchase obligations we have entered into certain collaboration agreements with third parties that include the funding of certain research and development activities and potential future milestone and royalty payments by us 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2021 will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations capital expenditures and share repurchases through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of the financial statements included in this annual report on form 10k we are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors including expenses related to the ongoing covid19 pandemic which may adversely affect our business our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forwardlooking statement and involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 

if we fail to sustain profitability on a continuing basis we may be required to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings structured financings and debt financings government funding arrangements potential future strategic alliances from which we receive upfront fees milestone payments and other forms of consideration and marketing manufacturing distribution and licensing arrangements if we are required to finance future cash needs additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our investigational medicines or slow down or cease work on one or more of our programs if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders or increased fixed payment obligations and any such securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock if we incur indebtedness we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise funds through strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams research programs or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us any of these events could significantly harm our business financial condition and prospects 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2021 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in millions 



 

1 the amounts in the table include a total payment of 637 million associated with our mtc leases for the optional lease extension periods for accounting purpose a lease term is the noncancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

2 we entered into a lease agreement for approximately 462000 square feet in cambridge massachusetts moderna science center and will undergo an approximately twoyear building project following the building project the lease term is 15 years subject to our right to extend the lease for up to two additional sevenyear terms the rent will commence on the initial phase commencement date defined in the lease agreement that is currently estimated to be in july 2023 

3 the amounts represent noncancelable fixed payment obligations related to purchases of raw materials contract manufacturing services clinical services and other goods or services in the normal course of business 

we have agreements with certain vendors for various services including services related to clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs under such agreements we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors mainly to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation the exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated at december 31 2021 we had cancelable open purchase orders of 24 billion in total under such agreements for our clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing these amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay at december 31 2021 assuming we would not cancel these agreements the actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the cancelable open purchase order amounts of 24 billion 

in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

as of december 31 2021 and 2020 we had cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments in marketable securities of 176 billion and 52 billion respectively our investment portfolio comprises money market funds and marketable debt securities including us treasury securities debt securities of us government agencies and corporate entities and commercial paper which are classified as availableforsale securities our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity and our investment policy defines allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to minimize risk exposure our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 

our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase due to the shortterm maturities and low risk profiles of our investments we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by one percentage point from levels at december 31 2021 the net fair value of our marketable securities would decrease by approximately 146 million 

foreign currency risk 

our revenue generating activities and operations have been primarily denominated in us dollars our significant foreign currency revenue exposure for the year ended december 31 2021 was the equivalent of 59 billion in euros as we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we have implemented cash flow hedging and balance sheet hedging programs 

cash flow hedging activities 

we hedge foreign currency product sales denominated in euros including the use of foreign exchange forward contracts or purchased options we hedge our cash flow exposures to reduce the risk that our earnings and cash flows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges our foreign exchange contracts as of december 31 2021 carried at fair value had maturities of up to 9 months 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities these contracts reduce the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our assets and liabilities as of december 31 2021 our outstanding balance sheet hedging derivatives carried at fair value had maturities of less than three months 

we enter into these foreign exchange contracts to hedge our forecasted revenue and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency in the normal course of business and accordingly they are not speculative in nature we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical adverse movement of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollars across all maturities would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in cash flow hedging of approximately 54 million as of december 31 2021 a hypothetical adverse movement of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollars across all maturities would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of approximately 115 million we expect that any increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the underlying exposures being hedged

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2021 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2021 management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2021

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level however our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by the collusion of two or more people or by a management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

the mrna opportunity   

mrna the software of life 

messenger rna or mrna transfers the information stored in our genes to the cellular machinery that makes all the proteins required for life our genes are stored as sequences of dna which contain the instructions to make specific proteins dna serves as a hard drive safely storing these instructions in the nucleus until they are needed by the cell 

when a cell needs to produce a protein the instructions to make that protein are copied from the dna to mrna which serves as the template for protein production each mrna molecule contains the instructions to produce a specific protein with a distinct function in the body mrna transmits those instructions to cellular machinery called ribosomes that make copies of the required protein 

we see mrna functioning as the “software of life” every cell uses mrna to provide real time instructions to make the proteins necessary to drive all aspects of biology including in human health and disease this was codified as the central dogma of molecular biology over 50 years ago and is exemplified in the schematic below 

mrna is used to make every type of protein including secreted membrane and intracellular proteins in varying quantities over time in different locations and in various combinations this is shown in the figure below 

since our founding in 2010 we have been inspired by the belief that mrna could be used to create a new class of medicines with significant potential to improve the lives of patients in 2020 mrna technology emerged as a new class of medicine with the potential to help treat the ongoing global pandemic in the span of just over 11 months we designed a vaccine against covid19 mrna1273 using mrnabased technology conducted phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials which demonstrated that the vaccine was highly effective at preventing covid19 and obtained an emergency use authorization eua for the vaccine from the us food and drug administration on december 18 2020 followed a few days later by an interim order from health canada authorizing the distribution of the vaccine in canada by december 31 2020 we had delivered nearly 17 million doses of the moderna covid19 vaccine to the us government and several hundred thousand doses to the canadian government to help fight the pandemic as of december 31 2020 we had committed orders for approximately 520 million doses of the vaccine to be delivered in 2021 to governments around the world 

the success we experienced in 2020 builds on over 40 years of progress in the biotechnology industry our approach fundamentally differs from traditional approaches to medicine rather than introduce a protein or chemical to the body we send tailored mrna into cells to instruct them to produce specific proteins we built moderna on the guiding premise that if mrna can be used as a medicine for one disease it could work for many diseases instead of starting from scratch for each new vaccine or therapy our mrna approach leverages the technology and fundamental components that we have been researching and developing since our founding by building off our prior research and learning we believe we can improve how we discover develop and manufacture medicines 

our success in developing the moderna covid19 vaccine further underpins our belief that mrnabased medicines have the potential to help patients in ways that could equal or exceed the impact of traditional approaches to medicine 

our strategic priorities 

our first priority for 2021 is to maximize the impact of our covid19 vaccine both in terms of access and value creation of this product between now and the end of 2021 we are closely monitoring emerging variants of the sarscov2 virus as it continues to evolve and testing the performance of our vaccine against them we are also studying potential booster shots either of the existing vaccine or of a version that has been adjusted to address significant variants as well as conducting further clinical trials in younger populations with the hope of being able to provide the vaccine to adolescents aged 12 to 18 by fall 2021 executing on this first priority will allow us to pursue our second priority to accelerate vaccine development to advance our pipeline and bring new vaccines to market in turn this will make way for our third priority to generate human proofofconcept data in autoimmune diseases cardiovascular diseases oncology and rare diseases and this will allow for our fourth priority to continue to expand the use of mrna technology to maximize the potential impact we can have on patients we continue to believe that over time we will have a number of commercial products within our different modalities which are described in more detail below 

in january 2021 we announced the expansion of our pipeline of prophylactic vaccines with three new development programs mrna vaccine candidates against seasonal flu human immunodeficiency virus hiv and the nipah virus we also announced our intent to expand our respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine program into older adults we currently have 24 mrna development programs in our portfolio with 13 having entered the clinic 

as of february 15 2021 we had received additional regulatory authorizations for use of our covid19 vaccine in europe the united kingdom israel switzerland singapore and qatar we continue forging ahead with the rolling reviews of our covid19 vaccine that have already been initiated with several regulatory agencies across the globe and the who which is important for obtaining regulatory authorization to distribute the vaccine in many middle and lowincome countries 

the early investment we made in our manufacturing and digital capabilities prepared us to rapidly scale our production at present we believe we will be able to produce between 700 million and 1 billion doses of our covid19 vaccine in 2021 we are continuing to invest and add staff to make this production possible we are also working on increasing our potential supply to up to 14 billion doses for 2022 much of the production for the supply of the us market will be completed at our moderna technology center facility or mtc south in norwood massachusetts with additional production by lonza ltd for the us market we have also partnered with lonza to complete all production in switzerland of our covid19 vaccine generally referred to as covid19 vaccine moderna outside the us for markets other than the us fillfinish services for our covid19 vaccine are provided by catalent inc in the us and by rovi and recipharm outside the us we have also partnered with other contract manufacturing organizations for the production of and fillfinish services for our covid19 vaccine and expect that we will enter into additional collaborations as we scale production 

the structure of mrna 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprising four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the molecule that codes for a protein or the coding region the sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons the first codon or start codon aug signals where the ribosome 

should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein to end protein synthesis three different codons uaa uag and uga serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis in total there are 64 potential codons but only 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins therefore multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid 

the process of protein production is called translation because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids as shown in the figure below the coding region is analogous to a sentence in english much like a start codon a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

the intrinsic advantages of using mrna as a medicine 

mrna possesses inherent characteristics that we believe provide it with a strong foundation as a new class of medicines these characteristics include 

1 mrna is used by every cell to produce all proteins cells in the human body use mrna to make all types of proteins including secreted membrane and intracellular proteins mrna is used by cells to vary the quantities of protein produced over time in different locations and in various combinations given the universal role of mrna in protein production we believe that mrna medicines could have broad applicability across human disease 

2 making proteins inside one’s own cells mimics human biology using a person’s own cells to produce protein therapeutics or vaccine antigens provides certain advantages over existing technologies such as recombinant proteins which are manufactured using processes that are foreign to the human body these advantages include the ability to 

• use multiple mrnas to produce multiple proteins 

• reduce or eliminate immunogenicity 

• create multiprotein complexes 

• produce therapeutic or vaccine proteins locally 

• harness native protein folding and glycosylation and 

• make proteins that are unstable outside the body 

3 mrna has a simple and flexible chemical structure each mrna molecule comprises four chemically similar nucleotides to encode proteins made from up to 20 chemically different amino acids to make the full diversity of possible proteins only simple sequence changes are required in mrna a vast number of potential mrna medicines can be developed therefore with only minor changes to the underlying chemical structure of the molecule or manufacturing processes a significant advantage over small molecule or protein therapeutics 

4 mrna has classic pharmacologic features the intrinsic properties of mrna translate into attractive pharmacologic features including 

• each mrna encodes for a specific protein and no other protein 

• each mrna molecule can produce many copies of a protein in the cell before being degraded 

• increasing mrna levels in a cell generally leads to increasing protein levels and 

• the effects of mrna in a cell can be transient and limits risk of irreversible changes to the cell’s dna 

as a result mrna possesses many of the attractive pharmacologic features of most modern medicines including reproducible activity predictable potency and wellbehaved dose dependency and the ability to adjust dosing based on an individual patient’s needs including stopping or lowering the dose to seek to ensure safety and tolerability 

mrna as a new class of medicines 

based on these and other features we have developed four core beliefs about the value drivers of mrna as a new class of medicines 

1 mrna has the potential to create an unprecedented abundance and diversity of medicines although only two infectious disease vaccines using mrna technology have been authorized to date for emergency use or other provisional interim or conditional use in response to the covid19 pandemic we believe this success further demonstrates the potential for mrna medicines to provide patients or healthy individuals with any therapeutic protein or vaccine including those targeting intracellular and membrane proteins this breadth of applicability has the potential to create an extraordinary number of new mrnabased medicines that are currently beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology 

2 advances in the development of our mrna medicines can reduce risks across our portfolio mrna medicines share fundamental features that can be used to learn quickly across a portfolio we believe that once safety and proof of protein production has been established in one program the technology and biology risks of related programs that use similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes will decrease significantly we believe that the progress of our covid19 vaccine has helped mitigate risk associated with our prophylactic vaccine modality 

3 mrna technology can accelerate discovery and development the softwarelike features of mrna enable rapid in silico design and the use of automated highthroughput synthesis processes that permit discovery to proceed in parallel rather than sequentially we believe these mrna features can also accelerate drug development by allowing the use of shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure 

4 the ability to leverage shared processes and infrastructure can drive significant capital efficiency over time we believe the manufacturing requirements of different mrna medicines are dramatically more similar than traditional recombinant proteinbased drugs across a similarly diverse pipeline when manufacturing at commercial scale we believe a portfolio of mrna medicines will benefit from shared capital expenditures resulting in lower programspecific capital needs and an advantageous variable cost profile 

we believe that the development of mrna as a new class of medicines as evidenced by the development of mrnabased vaccines during 2020 represents a significant breakthrough for patients and our industry 

our strategic principles and approach to managing risk 

our strategy is designed to deliver on the full scope of the mrna opportunity over the longterm reaching patients with mrna medicines requires us to make complex choices including how much capital we devote to technology creation drug discovery drug development commercial and global marketing and infrastructure which programs we advance and how whether we advance programs alone or with strategic collaborators and which capabilities we build internally versus outsource 

to navigate these choices we established five strategic principles that guide our approach to creating longterm value for patients and investors no single strategic principle dominates our choices embedded in every decision we make is also our assessment of the most important risks inherent in our business we believe these risks fall into four categories technology biology execution and financing 

to increase our chances of success we often find it necessary to balance our neartomidterm risks against the strategic principles that guide our approach to longterm value creation 

our strategic principles 

1 we seek to discover and develop a large pipeline in parallel 

our goal is to address or prevent as many human diseases as our technology talent capital and other resources permit we do so as rapidly as we can understanding both the urgency for patients and the need to be disciplined in our approach we have a diverse pipeline of 24 development programs with 13 of them having entered the clinic many of which have the potential to be 

firstinclass or bestinclass medicines we have one commercial product our covid19 vaccine that is being distributed globally 

2 we undertake sustained longterm investment in technology creation we aim to improve the performance of mrna medicines in our current modalities and to unlock new modalities through investments within basic and applied science we are committed to remaining at the forefront of mrna science 

3 we focus on the pace and scale of our learning we believe that time is a critical resource we seek to accelerate our progress by solving numerous technical problems in parallel rather than in sequence our scientists pursue experiments based on how much we can learn from the results not just the probability of a positive outcome we believe negative information is valuable and we can learn from our setbacks we make significant investments in digital assets and research infrastructure to accelerate the pace and scale of our learning 

4 we integrate across the most critical parts of our value chain mrna is a complex multicomponent system and we believe it demands integration we believe that we must be directly engaged in research drug discovery drug development process and analytical development and manufacturing to accelerate our learning reduce our risk and protect our critical knowhow where appropriate we seek out strategic collaborators that can augment our capabilities or expand our capacity in specific therapeutic areas while being careful to resist the fragmentation of our core technology 

5 we forward invest in core enabling capabilities and infrastructure to execute across a broad pipeline we need to invest at risk before we have all the answers our forward investments focus on areas where lead times are long and where early investments can reduce execution risk and accelerate future progress we proactively invested in a dedicated manufacturing facility moderna technology center mtc in norwood ma to support the anticipated growth of our pipeline and this early investment greatly facilitated our ability to respond to the covid19 pandemic by allowing us to begin production of our vaccine even before we received regulatory authorization for its distribution 

our approach to managing risk 

in conjunction with the strategic principles that guide our approach to longterm value creation we actively manage the risks inherent in our business at present these categories of risk include technology biology execution and financing we summarize our approach to managing these risks below 

1 technology risk encompasses the challenges of developing the product features of mrna medicines including delivery controlling interactions with the immune system optimizing therapeutic index and manufacturing we believe the best way to mitigate technology risk is to sustain longterm investments in our platform in addition we diversify our technology risk by compartmentalizing our pipeline into groups of programs with shared product features which we call modalities lastly we stage program development within a modality leveraging the first program whether successful or not to generate insights that accelerate and reduce the risk of subsequent programs within the modality 

2 biology risk entails the risk unique to each program based on its mechanism of action and of clinical development in the target patient population we believe the best way to manage biology risk is to diversify it by pursuing multiple programs in parallel in addition within a modality we seek to initially pursue programs with wellunderstood biology lastly we may seek strategic collaborators to share risk and upside in disease areas with high inherent biology risk such as cancer and heart disease 

3 execution risk refers to the challenge of executing against the scale of our mission we solve for this risk by seeking to hire the right people the best talent in the industry we seek to foster a culture of execution with a focus on quick review cycles and high velocity decisionmaking we make forward investments in infrastructure including manufacturing lastly we have created a digital backbone to track all aspects of our programs and anticipate challenges before they arise 

4 financing risk refers to our ability to access the capital required to fund the current breadth of our endeavor as well as new opportunities we manage this risk by attempting to maintain a strong balance sheet with several years of cash runway as of december 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 525 billion this balance represents a significant increase in our liquidity over the prior year driven primarily by customer deposits for the sale of our covid19 vaccine as well as two equity offerings during the first half of the year in february and may 

there is no single strategic principle nor single category of risk that dominates our decisionmaking and universal rules do not exist across our portfolio our tradeoffs generally involve balancing nearterm risks and longterm value creation because development cycles are long our choices are complex we expect the weighting and types of risk we face will evolve as our business matures we 

believe that disciplined capital allocation across near and longterm choices must be a core competency if we are to maximize the opportunity for patient impact and shareholder value creation 

our progress 

our success in developing a highly effective vaccine against covid19 going from sequence selection conducting clinical trials and to receipt of regulatory authorization for emergency use all in less than a year provides a visible example of the promise of mrnabased medicine our covid19 vaccine is currently authorized or conditionally approved in over 30 countries and has already been used to vaccinate millions of patients to help combat the pandemic we believe our success in developing this vaccine has positive implications beyond infectious disease vaccines and across our six modalities we currently have 24 programs in development and our pipeline spans five therapeutic areas infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases cardiovascular diseases and autoimmune diseases we remain on track to produce between 700 million and 1 billion doses of our covid19 vaccine in 2021 

our platform 

overview of our platform 

our “platform” refers to our accumulated knowledge and capabilities in basic and applied sciences across mrna the delivery of mrna to target tissues and the manufacturing processes for making potential mrna medicines we invest in basic science to discover foundational mechanistic insights and we invest in applied sciences to invent technology that harnesses those insights we use our platform to identify and develop new mrna medicines when we identify a combination of platform technologies or programs across mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes that can enable shared product features across multiple potential mrna medicines we group those programs as a modality the primary goal of our platform is to identify new modalities and to expand the utility of our existing modalities we are committed to advancing the technological frontier of mrna medicines over the long term 

we define success in our platform as achieving the following pharmacologic properties 

• predictable dose response 

• reproducible pharmacology including upon repeat dosing 

• therapeutic potency through achieving the intended pharmacologic activity in the target tissue 

• safety and tolerability and 

• scalability for development 

achieving any of these pharmacologic properties requires many often interdependent technological solutions we organize our efforts into three core scientific areas mrna delivery and manufacturing process as shown in the figure below 

we pursue mrna science to minimize undesirable activation of the immune system by mrna to maximize the mrna potency of mrna once inside target cells and to extend pharmacology of our therapeutics we pursue delivery science to protect mrna from extracellular enzymes that would degrade it to avoid counterproductive interactions of our delivery vehicles with the immune system deliver mrna to desired tissues and facilitate mrna transport across cell membranes to the translational machinery within cells finally we have learned that the methods for producing mrna and lipid nanoparticle or lnp delivery systems can have profound positive and negative effects on pharmacology we pursue process science to optimize these features for our future medicines and to develop technical capabilities to scale our potential mrna medicines for clinical development 

we have incurred significant expense to advance our platform technology and our intellectual property this investment has underpinned the creation of all six of our existing modalities and helped us to establish fundamental intellectual property we intend to sustain our investment in our platform in the future because we believe we can establish new modalities and continue to make meaningful improvements in the performance of our current modalities 

our covid19 vaccine demonstrates the success of our current platform our current pipeline which consists of 24 programs depends on hundreds of small advances and 10 years of research and investment in our three core scientific areas examples of many 

critical advances that we have made are described below these advances demonstrate our significant progress to date and exemplify our approach to tackling hundreds of smaller scientific problems and organizing them into technological solutions 

our platform mrna science 

an overview of mrna biology 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprised of four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the mrna molecule that serves as instructions for protein synthesis the coding region the exact sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons one codon the start codon aug serves to signal where the ribosome should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids this process is called translation finally three different codons uaa uag and uga can serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis the production of proteins from mrna sequences is called translation and is used to make all human proteins the production of mrna from dna is called transcription 

as shown in the figure below the coding region in an mrna molecule is analogous to a sentence in english the start codon indicates the start of the protein much like a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

in every cell hundreds of thousands of mrnas make hundreds of millions of proteins every day a typical protein contains 200600 amino acids therefore a typical mrna coding region ranges from 6001800 nucleotides 

in addition to the coding region mrnas contain four other key features 1 the 5’ untranslated region or 5’utr 2 the 3’ untranslated region or 3’utr 3 the 5’ cap and 4 a 3’ polyadenosine or polya tail the sequence of nucleotides in the 5’utr influences how efficiently the ribosome initiates protein synthesis whereas the sequence of nucleotides in the 3’utr contains information about which cell types should translate that mrna and how long the mrna should last the 5’ cap and 3’ polya tail enhance ribosome engagement and protect the mrna from attack by intracellular enzymes that digest mrna from its ends as a result of this biology mrna has several key features first mrna is exquisitely specific there is a onetoone correspondence between an mrna molecule and the protein dictated by the coding sequence second the biological effects of mrna are amplified because each mrna copy can be translated thousands of times we believe that in some cases a small number of mrna copies per cell may be sufficient to induce a pharmacologic effect finally mrna is impermanent mrnas produce proteins for a defined and biologicallyregulated period of time without risk of changing genes or cell dna if dosing of mrna stops protein production will stop and the biological effects generally can be reversed 

we continue to invest in both applied and basic research seeking to advance both the state of our technology and the state of the scientific community’s understanding of mrna examples of advances in mrna science that combine nucleotide chemistry sequence engineering and targeting elements are described below 

mrna chemistry modified nucleotides to mitigate immune system activation 

the innate immune system has evolved to protect cells from foreign rna such as viral rna by inducing inflammation and suppressing mrna translation once detected many cells surveil their environment through sensors called tolllikereceptors or tlrs these include types that are activated by the presence of doublestranded rna tlr3 or uridine containing rna fragments tlr7 tlr8 additionally all cells have cytosolic doublestranded rna sensors including retinoic acid inducible genei or rigi that are sensitive to foreign rna inside the cell 

the immune and cellular response to mrna is complex context specific and often linked to the sensing of uridine to minimize undesired immune responses to our potential mrna medicines our platform employs chemicallymodified uridine nucleotides to minimize recognition by both immune cell sensors such as tlr378 and broadlydistributed cytosolic receptors such as rigi mrna produced using our synthesis technologies and containing unmodified uridine results in significant upregulation of secreted cytokines such as ip10 which is indicative of local immune cell activation administration of monocytederived macrophages or mdms with unmodified mrna formulated in lnps results in an increased ratio of ip10 transcripts relative to a housekeeping gene by substituting unmodified uridine with a modified uridine we can substantially reduce immune cell activation in this assay the control contains only transfection agent and no mrna in multiple preclinical experiments we have demonstrated reduced immune cell activation including of b cells lower immunoglobulin secretion and lower cytokine expression when administering mrna made with modified uridine versus unmodified uridine to date when deploying these technologies we have yet to observe doselimiting toxicity attributable to the mrna encoding proteins from our drug substance even at the exaggerated doses in indenabling glp toxicology programs importantly in preclinical testing our chemicallymodified uridine has not significantly affected the ribosome’s ability to read and translate the mrna sequence 

nucleotide chemistry of mrna reduces immune activation in vitro in monocytederived macrophages 

mrna sequence engineering maximizing protein expression 

mrna exists transiently in the cytoplasm during which time it can be translated into thousands of proteins before eventually being degraded our platform applies bioinformatic biochemical and biological screening capabilities most of which have been invented internally that aim to optimize the amount of protein produced per mrna we have identified proprietary sequences for the 5’utr that have been observed to increase the likelihood that a ribosome bound to the 5’end of the mrna transcript will find the desired start codon and reliably initiate translation of the coding region 

we additionally design the nucleotide sequence of the coding region to maximize its successful translation into protein as previously described there are often multiple codons that encode for a specific amino acid the amount of protein produced by an mrna sequence is known to be partly determined by the codons it uses with certain codons being more or less common in endogenous mrnas we have found that the amount of protein produced is also determined by the secondary structure of mrna or the propensity of mrna to fold on itself with more structured mrnas producing more protein we designed a set of sequences which independently varied codon usage and structure of the mrna as shown in the figure below protein expression in the alpha mouse liver 12 cell line is highest for sequences containing more commonly occurring codons and also more structured mrna both codon usage and structure have an independent and additive effect on protein expression shown as mean expression solid line as measured by fluorescence of the expressed protein with 95 confidence interval in gray the total expression area under the curve or auc and standard error of the mean for auc are shown for each quadrant in relative fluorescence units per hour by optimizing translation initiation and efficiency we have further increased the average number of fulllength desired proteins expressed per molecule mrna this permits us to reduce the mrna doses required to achieve the same therapeutic benefit 

sequences with more structure and more common codons in mrna maximize protein expression in vitro 

targeting elements enabling tissuetargeted translation 

all nucleated cells in the body are capable of translating mrna resulting in pharmacologic activity in any cell in which mrna is delivered and translated to minimize or prevent potential offtarget effects our platform employs technologies that regulate mrna translation in select cell types cells often contain short rna sequences called micrornas or mirnas that bind to mrna to regulate protein translation at the mrna level different cell types have different concentrations of specific micrornas in effect giving cells a microrna signature microrna binding directly to mrna effectively silences or reduces mrna translation and promotes mrna degradation we design microrna binding sites into the 3’utr of our potential mrna medicines so that if our mrna is delivered to cells with such micrornas it will be minimally translated and rapidly degraded 

as an example we have demonstrated by intratumoral administration in an animal model that an mrna encoding a cytotoxic protein and containing a microrna binding site can be used to selectively kill cancer cells while protecting systemic tissues such as liver cells in a mouse model of cancer hep3b subcutaneous xenograft mouse liver enzyme levels and immunohistochemistry or ihc of cleaved caspase3 indicate production of an apoptosisinducing protein encoded by mrna in tumor cells but not healthy liver cells when the mrna has multiple mir122 target sites this is denoted as 3x122ts in the figure below mir122 is more prevalent in noncancerous liver cells but absent in the cancerous liver cells we published this work in nucleic acid therapeutics in 2018 

tissuetargeted translation of mrna encoding a proapoptotic protein 

and microrna binding sites in mouse study 

our platform delivery science 

we focus on the delivery of our mrna molecules to specific tissues our mrna can in specific instances such as our vegf therapeutic be delivered by direct injection to a tissue in a simple saline formulation without lipid nanoparticles or lnps to locally produce small amounts of pharmacologically active protein however the blood and interstitial fluids in humans contain significant rna degrading enzymes that rapidly degrade any extracellular mrna and prevent broader distribution without lnps additionally cell membranes tend to act as a significant barrier to entry of large negativelycharged molecules such as mrna we have therefore 

invested heavily in delivery science and have developed lnp technologies as well as alternative nanoparticle approaches to enable delivery of larger quantities of mrna to target tissues 

lnps are generally composed of four components an amino lipid a phospholipid cholesterol and a pegylatedlipid or peglipid each component as well as the overall composition or mix of components contributes to the properties of each lnp system lnps containing mrna injected into the body rapidly bind proteins that can drive uptake of lnps into cells once internalized in endosomes within cells the lnps are designed to escape the endosome and release their mrna cargo into the cell cytoplasm where the mrna can be translated to make a protein and have the desired therapeutic effect any mrna and lnp components that do not escape the endosome are typically delivered to lysosomes where they are degraded by the natural process of cellular digestion 

examples of tools we developed by using our platform include proprietary lnp formulations that address the steps of mrna delivery including cell uptake endosomal escape and subsequent lipid metabolism and for avoidance of counterproductive interactions with the immune system examples of delivery tools we have developed are described below 

chemistry novel lipid chemistry to potentially improve safety and tolerability 

we initially used lnp formulations that were based on known lipid systems which we refer to as “legacy lnps” a recognized limitation of these legacy lnps is the potential for inflammatory reactions upon single and repeat administration that can impact tolerability and therapeutic index our laterdeveloped proprietary lnp systems are therefore designed to be highly tolerated and minimize any lnp vehiclerelated toxicities with repeat administration in vivo  the changes we made have included engineering amino lipids to avoid the immune system and to be rapidly biodegradable relative to prior lipids administered intravenously in nonhuman primates at 02 mgkg our proprietary lnps demonstrate rapid clearance of the lipid from plasma and organs such as peripheral lymphoid organs and the liver 

rapid clearance of lipid components of lnps from plasma in nonhuman primate study 

yaxis in logscale 

even in the case of vaccines where one might hypothesize that lnpinduced immune stimulation could potentially increase the effectiveness of the vaccine we have demonstrated in preclinical studies that we can maintain the desired immune response to the vaccine while reducing undesired local immune reaction or reactogenicity to the lnp the tolerability of our vaccine formulation has been demonstrated clinically and to date millions of individuals worldwide have received our vaccine against covid19 

composition proprietary lnps enhance delivery efficiency 

our platform includes extensive inhouse expertise in medicinal chemistry which we have applied to design large libraries of novel lipids using these libraries in combination with our discovery biology capabilities we have conducted high throughput screens for desired lnp properties and believe that we have made fundamental discoveries in preclinical studies about the relationships between structural motifs of lipids and lnp performance for protein expression by screening for components and compositions that enhance the amount of mrna delivered per cell and protein expression we have demonstrated with intravenous administration up to a sixfold improvement in protein production over the prior state of the art for lnps as shown in the figure below n3 rats 95 ci shown 

enhanced protein production with our proprietary lnp in rat study 

surface properties novel lnp design to avoid immune recognition 

we have designed our proprietary lnp systems for sustained pharmacology upon repeat dosing by eliminating or altering features that activate the immune system these are based on insights into the surface properties of lnps upon repeated dosing surface features on traditional lnps such as amino lipids phospholipids and peglipids can be recognized by the immune system leading to rapid clearance from the bloodstream a decrease in potency upon repeat dosing and an increase in inflammation 

based on our insights into these mechanisms we have engineered our lnp systems to reduce or eliminate undesirable surface features in preclinical studies in nonhuman primates for our systemic therapeutic development candidates that use our novel lnp systems we have been able to repeat dose with negligible or undetectable loss in potency liver damage and immune system activation 

our platform manufacturing process science 

we invest significantly in manufacturing process science to impart more potent features to our mrna and lnps and to invent the technological capabilities necessary to manufacture our potential mrna medicines at scales ranging from micrograms to kilograms as well as achieve pharmaceutical properties such as solubility and shelf life we view developing these goals of manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties as stage appropriate for each program in some cases this includes inventing novel analytical technologies that make it possible to connect analytical characterization of mrna and lnps to biological performance 

mrna manufacturing process improving pharmacology 

our platform creates mrna using a cellfree approach called in vitro transcription in which an rna polymerase enzyme binds to and transcribes a dna template adding the nucleotides encoded by the dna to the growing rna strand following transcription we employ proprietary purification techniques to ensure that our mrna is free from undesired synthesis components and impurities that could activate the immune system in an indiscriminate manner applying our understanding of the basic science underlying each step in the manufacturing process we have designed proprietary manufacturing processes to impart desirable pharmacologic features for example increasing potency in a vaccine using a model antigen injected intramuscularly in mice at a 3 microgram µg mrna dose the figure below shows the significant improvement in cd8 t cell response we have achieved through mrna manufacturing process science and engineering as evidenced by process b 

manufacturing process changes to tune immune response in mouse study 

lnp manufacturing process improving pharmacology 

our platform technology includes synthetic processes to produce lnps traditionally lnps are assembled by dissolving the four molecular components amino lipid phospholipid cholesterol and peglipid in ethanol and then mixing this with mrna in an aqueous buffer the resulting mixture is then purified to isolate lnps from impurities such impurities include molecular components that have not been incorporated into particles unencapsulated mrna that could activate the immune system and particles outside of the desired size range 

going beyond optimization of traditional manufacturing processes we have invested in understanding and measuring the various biochemical and physical interactions during lnp assembly and purification we have additionally developed stateoftheart analytical techniques necessary to characterize our lnps and biological systems to analyze their in vitro and in vivo performance with these insights we have identified manufacturing process parameters that drive lnp performance for example the potency in a secreted therapeutic setting these insights have allowed us to make significant improvements in the efficiency of our processing and the potency of our lnps as exemplified in the figure below for example expression of a secreted protein in our relaxin program demonstrates an approximate eightfold increase in auc and approximate sixfold increase in maximum concentration for manufacturing process y versus manufacturing process x in rats dosed intravenously with 05 mgkg mrna 

manufacturing process changes to enhance relaxin protein production by mrna in rat study 

our platform progress to date 

since our inception we have solved numerous interdependent problems related to the pharmacologic features of our potential mrna medicines these features are detailed and exemplified below please also see the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” for recent clinical results for our investigational medicines including our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 cmv vaccine mrna1647 hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 and pcv mrna4157 utilizing moderna proprietary technology 

dosedependent protein expression in the clinic 

we have demonstrated in the clinic the ability to generate consistent dose dependent levels of protein antibody as well as the ability to safely repeat dose interim data from our phase 1 study evaluating escalating doses of mrna1944 in the 06 mgkg dose with steroid premedication cohort and two doses of 03 mgkg without steroid premedication given one week apart demonstrated dosedependent increases in levels of antibody against chikungunya safety and increased chkvigg production in the twodose regimen shows the platform’s ability for repeat dosing 

expression of antibody against chikungunya virus in the phase 1 study of mrna1944 

reproducible pharmacology including upon repeated dosing 

by combining advances in mrna delivery and manufacturing process science we have demonstrated in preclinical studies sustained and reproducible pharmacology the figure below shows a recent example in a mouse model that recapitulates metabolic defects in propionic acidemia or pa in this rare disease a defect in one or both of two different subunits pcca and pccb of the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase results in accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 2methylcitrate or 2mcin mice hypomorphic for the pcca subunit monthly intravenous or iv administration of mrnas encoding pcca and pccb formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna3927 resulted in a significant and sustained lowering of 2mc throughout the duration of the 6month study compared to control luciferase mrna 1 mgkg n6group we are currently recruiting pa patients for our phase 1 trial of mrna3927 as noted above we have also seen success in repeat dosing of our antibody against chikungunya virus

decreased immune activation upon repeat dosing in nonhuman primates 

we have observed decreased immune activation which enables repeat dosing in nonhuman primates as shown in the figure below the data below indicates serum concentration of human erythropoietin or hepo with repeat dosing of mrna encoding hepo in our proprietary lnps with weekly iv administration at 02 mgkg in nonhuman primates 

repeat dosing with mrna encoding for hepo in our proprietary lnp in nonhuman primate study 

we believe that by combining proprietary mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing process technologies we have significantly advanced the potential therapeutic index of our potential mrnabased therapeutics 

pharmacologic activity in the target tissue and cell 

while some of our modalities such as systemic secreted therapeutics can leverage many different cell types to make therapeutic proteins others such as systemic intracellular therapeutics may require delivery of our mrna into specific tissues and cell types for instance hepatocytes in certain liver metabolic diseases combining our proprietary mrna delivery and manufacturing process technologies we have observed ontarget pharmacologic activity in hepatocytes in nonhuman primates the ontarget potency of this approach contrasts with traditional delivery technologies in the figure below one of our proprietary lnps with increased hepatocyte transfecting properties result in protein expression in liver hepatocytes in nonhuman primates as demonstrated with a reporter protein detected by immunohistochemistry at 6 hours after iv infusion at 2 mgkg

additionally this lnp results in extended expression of a secreted reporter protein in nonhuman primates as compared to one of our other proprietary lnps after iv delivery at 01mgkg 

our platform’s future improving and expanding our modalities 

we are committed to sustaining investment in our platform both in basic science to elucidate new mechanistic insights and in applied science to discover new technologies that harness these insights our platform investments have enabled six modalities to date most of which have already led to multiple development candidates and investigational medicines in our pipeline we believe that sustaining our investment in platform research and development will enable further improvements in the current modalities and will lead to the creation of new modalities both of which will benefit our clinical pipeline in the years ahead 

creating modalities with shared product features 

our approach to developing modalities 

within our platform we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features we call that group a “ modality ” while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases they share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals as well as pharmaceutical properties programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk we have created six modalities to date 

• prophylactic vaccines 

• cancer vaccines 

• intratumoral immunooncology 

• localized regenerative therapeutics 

• systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics and 

• systemic intracellular therapeutics 

when entering into a new modality our approach is consistent with our strategic principles and perspectives on risk management discussed previously the tenets of our approach are summarized below 

• we identify a first program or programs through which we seek to discover and develop solutions for any modalityspecific technological challenges we then leverage the learnings from this first program to the benefit of all subsequent programs in the modality 

• we seek to diversify biology risks within the modality by advancing multiple programs in parallel against multiple diseases following the first program 

• when we believe a strategic collaborator could significantly derisk our early efforts in a new modality we often seek a strategic collaborator to share the risks and benefits on a specific set of early programs 

• after experience with the first program or programs in a modality we seek to rapidly expand our pipeline within that modality to take full advantage of the opportunity 

illustrating our approach from our first modality to today 

we started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality because we believed this modality faced lower technical hurdles relative to other areas our early formulations of mrna tended to stimulate the immune system which would present a challenge to therapeutics but was a desired feature for vaccines in addition many potential prophylactic vaccine antigens are wellcharacterized allowing us to reduce biology risk lastly the dosing regimens for vaccines require as few as one or two administrations and generally involve relatively low doses 

for our first programs in this modality we chose our h10n8 and h7n9 pandemic influenza vaccines each requiring expression of a single membrane protein 

we chose to pursue two programs in separate but parallel clinical trials to establish the flexibility of our platform 

when both programs met our goals for safety tolerability and pharmacology we accelerated and expanded our vaccine pipeline to include multiple commercially meaningful and increasingly complex vaccines these included a combination vaccine designed to protect against two unrelated respiratory viruses human metapneumovirus or hmpv and human parainfluenza 3 or piv3 and a vaccine that combines six different mrnas our cytomegalovirus or cmv vaccine to express a complex pentameric antigen we also sought strategic alliances with the defense advanced research projects agency darpa the biomedical advanced research development authority barda and merck  co merck to allow us to rapidly expand our pipeline and complement our capabilities with their expertise this early work in the prophylactic vaccines modality led to the ability to introduce our covid19 vaccine during 2020 in response to the ongoing pandemic 

over time we have taken on more challenging applications and technological hurdles with each successive modality but we have also tried to build upon our prior experiences to manage risk for example in our cancer vaccines modality we are now applying our technology to elicit t cell responses to potentially recognize and eradicate cancer as a logical extension of our prophylactic vaccines modality having demonstrated local expression of protein in our vaccines we expanded into local therapeutic applications for example in our intratumoral immunooncology modality we are seeking to use local expression to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming tumor microenvironments we can also use local expression to drive regenerative processes as in our vascular endothelial growth factor a or vegfa program most recently we have expanded into two new modalities that use systemic delivery of mrna to encode secreted and cell surface or intracellular proteins we have moved multiple programs in these areas into development for the treatment of diseases as varied as rare genetic disorders preventing viral infections or treating heart failure 

expanding within our designated core modalities 

in 2020 we designated the prophylactic vaccines and systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modalities as “core modalities” following positive phase 1 data from our cmv vaccine and chikungunya antibody program respectively we believed that this data reduced the risk of these modalities and our strategy is to invest in additional development candidates within these modalities 

since january 2020 we have nominated six new development candidates within our prophylactic vaccines modality including our covid19 vaccine which is now authorized for emergency use or conditionally approved in over 30 countries as well as vaccine 

candidates for seasonal flu hiv nipah virus and ebv we also regained rights to develop an rsv vaccine for adults following the conclusion of our collaboration with merck in october 2020 which consolidated our global commercial rights to all development candidates within our prophylactic vaccines modality 

within our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality we announced two new development candidates in 2020 interleukin2 or il2 and programmed deathligand1 or pdl1 in 2021 we also announced that we have regained the rights to our relaxin program from astrazeneca and we are currently evaluating how to proceed with the program our exploratory modalities continue to be a critical part of advancing our strategy to maximize the application of our potential mrna medicines 

how modalities continue to build our pipeline 

we believe our portfolio of modalities—each with distinct technological and biological risk profiles—allows us to maximize longterm value for patients and investors we see our six current modalities as six distinct multiproduct pipelines that represent different risk profiles and benefit from common infrastructure and a shared platform technology we believe the high technology correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of the pipeline in that modality based on learnings from the initial programs we believe the lower technology correlation between modalities allows us to compartmentalize the technology risks 

we believe our ongoing investments in our platform will lead to the identification of additional new modalities in the future and will expand the diversity of our pipeline 

our pipeline 

since we nominated our first program in late 2014 we and our strategic collaborators have advanced in parallel a diverse development pipeline which currently consists of 27 development candidates across our 24 programs with 13 having entered the clinic and an additional development candidate subject to an open investigational new drug application ind aspects of our pipeline have been supported through strategic alliances including with astrazeneca merck and vertex pharmaceuticals or vertex and governmentsponsored organizations and private foundations focused on global health initiatives including barda darpa the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid the national institutes of health nih the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations cepi and the bill  melinda gates foundation 

our selection process for advancing new development candidates reflects both programspecific considerations as well as portfoliowide considerations programspecific criteria include among other relevant factors the severity of the unmet medical need the biology risk of our chosen target or disease the feasibility of clinical development the costs of development and the commercial opportunity portfoliowide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform components within a modality thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs in the modality and in some cases in other modalities 

the breadth of biology addressable using mrna technology is reflected in our current development pipeline of 24 programs the diversity of proteins made from mrna within our development pipeline is shown in the figure below 

the following chart shows our current pipeline of 24 development programs grouped into modalities—first our two core modalities where we believe we have reduced the technology risk followed by our four exploratory modalities in which we are continuing to investigate the clinical use of mrna medicines 

prophylactic vaccines modality 

we designed our prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent or control infectious diseases this modality includes our covid19 vaccine which was first authorized by the us fda for emergency use in december 2020 for vaccination of adults age 18 and older against sarscov2 our prophylactic vaccines modality currently includes ten development candidates in addition to our commercial covid19 vaccine all of which are vaccines against viruses the goal of any vaccine is to safely preexpose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen called an antigen so that the immune system is prepared to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future and prevent infection or disease 

prophylactic vaccines opportunity 

vaccines to prevent infectious diseases are one of the great innovations of modern medicine in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention cdc estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322 million americans from falling ill 21 million hospitalizations 732000 deaths 295 billion of direct costs and 13 trillion in social costs the commercial opportunity for vaccines is significant the worldwide vaccine market in 2019 was 35 billion more innovative vaccines have been able to achieve pricing per regimen generally ranging from 5 to 20 times that of seasonal flu vaccines 

prophylactic vaccines product features 

we believe mrnabased vaccines offer several advantages including 

• ability to mimic many aspects of natural viral infections mrna enters cells and is used to produce viral antigen proteins from within the cell that include natural posttranslational modifications this mimics the process by which natural viral infections occur where information from viral genomes is used to produce viral proteins from within a cell this can potentially enhance the immune response including improved b and t cell responses 

• multiplexing of mrna for more compelling product profiles  multiple mrnas encoding for multiple viral proteins can be included in a single vaccine either permitting production of complex multimeric antigens that are much more difficult to achieve with traditional technologies or producing antigens from multiple viruses at once as an example our cmv vaccine mrna1647 contains six mrnas five of which encode five different proteins that combine to form a pentameric protein complex that is a potentially critical antigen for immune protection against cmv 

• rapid discovery and advancement of mrna programs into the clinic  many viral antigens are known however with traditional vaccines the target pathogens or antigens have to be produced in dedicated cellcultures andor fermentationbased manufacturing production processes in order to initiate testing of potential vaccine constructs our ability to design our antigens in silico allows us to rapidly produce and test antigens in preclinical models which can dramatically accelerate our vaccine selection 

• capital efficiency and speed from shared manufacturing processes and infrastructure traditional vaccines require productdedicated production processes facilities and operators our mrna vaccines are produced in a manufacturing process that is sufficiently consistent across our pipeline to allow any one of our facilities the flexibility to produce any of our mrna vaccines 

prophylactic vaccines vaccines against respiratory viruses 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 

moderna’s covid19 vaccine has already been administered in millions of patients and is authorized for use in more than 30 countries 

our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 was designed subject to phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials delivered clinical trial results and received emergency use and other conditional authorizations in less than a year and has been and continues to be a key tool in fighting the global sarscov2 pandemic the vaccine is referred to as the moderna covid19 vaccine in the us and canadian markets and is generally referred to as the covid19 vaccine moderna in other markets forwardlooking references to our covid19 vaccine in this annual report on form 10k may include future modifications to mrna1273 or other development candidates that are designed to provide protection against variants of the sarscov2 virus 

we worked throughout 2020 to expand our manufacturing capacity and partnered with other companies to supplement that production and currently anticipate that we will be able to produce between 700 million and 1 billion doses of our covid19 vaccine in 2021 our covid19 vaccine is a twodose course meaning this production will be sufficient to vaccinate between 350 million and 500 million people against covid19 at the current 100 microgram µg dose as of december 31 2020 we had committed orders for approximately 520 million doses of the covid19 vaccine to be delivered in 2021 for total contract consideration of 117 billion we are conducting a phase 23 study of mrna1273 in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age additional studies are planned to evaluate our covid19 vaccine in children younger than 12 years and immunocompromised populations we are also conducting a field effectiveness trial in the united states to gather additional data in other populations including older adults and individuals with comorbidities that place them at increased risk for the complications of covid19 

on february 25 2021 we announced that the company is developing a nextgeneration vaccine against covid19 mrna1283 this vaccine candidate encodes for the portions of the sarscov2 spike protein that are critical for neutralization specifically the receptor binding domain rbd and nterminal domain ntd the encoded mrna1283 antigen is shorter than mrna1273 and is being developed as a potential refrigerator stable mrna vaccine that we anticipate will facilitate easier distribution and administration by healthcare providers mrna1283 is intended to be evaluated for use as a booster dose for previously vaccinated or infected individuals as well as in a primary series for seronegative individuals 

covid19 disease overview 

sarscov2 is the virus that causes covid19 disease which has led to over 24 million global deaths 

coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause illness in animals or humans in humans there are several known coronaviruses that cause respiratory infections these coronaviruses range from the common cold to more severe diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars middle east respiratory syndrome mers and covid19 sarscov2 is the novel coronavirus first identified in humans in december 2019 and is the cause of covid19 

covid19 is the most severe global pandemic since the influenza pandemic of 1918 as of february 18 2021 there have been over 110 million confirmed cases and over 24 million global deaths from covid19 the risk of mortality increases with age estimated to be 01 for individuals aged 019 6 for individuals over age 60 risk of severe disease and mortality increase for persons with preexisting diseases or comorbid conditions eg cardiovascular disease diabetes chronic lung disease obesity 

as the pandemic has continued variants of the original sarscov2 virus first detected in wuhan china have continued to evolve certain of these variant strains of sarscov2 have already proven to lead to increased rates of transmission of the virus and as the virus continues to evolve future strains or those already in circulation could cause more severe forms of disease some variant strains have also demonstrated resistance to existing vaccines and therapeutics for covid19 data from the primary efficacy analysis announced november 30 2020 suggested that mrna1273—which was designed based upon the genetic sequence of the virus first detected in wuhan china—is 941 efficacious against symptomatic covid19 disease with a clinicallyacceptable safety profile however while the neutralization titers are comparable for most variant strains tested including the b117 strain first identified in the united kingdom there are data to suggest a 64fold reduction in neutralization titers against the b1351 strain which was first identified in south africa while the titers against b1351 remain higher than those found to be protective against viral challenge in animal models we have nonetheless announced a proactive strategy to address variants of the virus we are continuing to collaborate with the nih to study the evolution of the sarscov2 virus and the effectiveness of mrna1273 against new strains as one part of this strategy we are testing additional boosters of mrna1273 to further increase protection against emerging strains additionally we are advancing an emerging strain booster referred to as mrna1273351 named for the b1351 strain to assess protection against that strain on february 24 2021 doses of mrna1273351 were shipped to the nih for a phase 1 clinical trial that will be led and funded by niaid 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 product concept 

our vaccine is an mrna vaccine against covid19 encoding for a prefusion stabilized form of the spike s protein which was codeveloped by moderna and investigators from niaid’s vaccine research center  

the spike protein complex is necessary for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target for the majority of vaccines against covid19 our covid19 vaccine encodes a stabilized version of the sarscov2 fulllength spike glycoprotein trimer s2p which has been modified to include two proline substitutions at the top of the central helix in the s2 subunit s2p 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 preclinical data 

mrna1273 led to protection against sarscov2 infection in the lungs and nose of nonhuman primates 

on july 29 2020 we announced the publication in the new england journal of medicine of data from a preclinical study of mrna1273 demonstrating that two doses of mrna1273 provided protection against lung inflammation following viral challenge with sarscov2 in nonhuman primates at both the 10 µg and 100 µg dose levels in addition both the 10 µg and 100 µg dose groups demonstrated protection against viral replication in the lungs with the 100 µg dose also protecting against viral replication in the nose of the animals of note none of the eight animals in the 100 µg group showed detectable viral replication in the nose compared to six out of eight in the placebo group on day 2 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 clinical data 

phase 1 trial a phase 1 openlabel study of mrna1273 is being conducted by the nih this study which began on march 16 2020 originally enrolled 45 healthy adult volunteers ages 18 to 55 years and is evaluating three dose cohorts 25 µg 100 µg and 250 µg an additional seven cohorts were subsequently added in the phase 1 study a 50 µg cohort in adults 1855 n15 three cohorts of older adults n30 ages 5670 25 µg 50 µg and 100 µg and three cohorts of elderly adults n30 ages 71 and above 25 µg 50 µg and 100 µg 

on july 14 2020 we announced the publication in the new england journal of medicine of an interim analysis of data from the original cohorts obtained through day 57 in the phase 1 study this interim analysis demonstrated that mrna1273 induced binding antibodies to the fulllength sarscov2 spike protein s in all participants after the first vaccination with all participants seroconverting by day 15 dose dependent increases in binding titers were seen across the three dose levels and between prime and boost vaccinations within the dose cohorts after two vaccinations at day 57 geometric mean titers exceeded those seen in convalescent sera obtained from 38 individuals with confirmed covid19 diagnosis of the 38 individuals in the convalescent sera group 15 were classified as having severe symptoms hospitalization requiring intensive care andor ventilation 22 had moderate symptoms and 63 had mild symptoms convalescent sera samples were tested using the same assays as the study samples mrna1273 was generally welltolerated with no serious adverse events reported through day 57 adverse events were generally transient and mild to moderate in severity 

evaluation of the durability of immune responses is ongoing and participants will be followed for one year after the second vaccination with scheduled blood collections throughout that period on december 2 2020 a letter to the editor was published in the new england journal of medicine reporting that participants in the phase 1 study of mrna1273 retained high levels of neutralizing antibodies through 119 days following first vaccination 90 days following second vaccination the study was led by niaid 

phase 1 older adult cohort on september 29 2020 we announced the publication in the new england journal of medicine of the second interim analysis of data from 40 healthy adult participants across two dose levels 25 µg and 100 µg in two age cohorts ages 5670 and ages 71 and reports results through day 57 1 month after the second dose both the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels of mrna1273 were generally welltolerated with no serious adverse events reported through day 57 

at both the 25 µg and 100 µg dose levels after two vaccinations mrna1273 induced dosedependent binding antibody responses reaching the upper quartile of the distribution of convalescent sera at day 57 1 month postdose 2 geometric mean titers gmt exceeded the median of those seen in convalescent sera from 41 individuals with confirmed covid19 diagnosis 

phase 3 trial the phase 3 cove trial for mrna1273 is a randomized 11 placebocontrolled study testing the vaccine at the 100 µg dose level in 30000 participants in the us ages 18 and older the primary endpoint of the cove study which is ongoing is the prevention of symptomatic covid19 disease key secondary endpoints include prevention of severe covid19 disease and prevention of infection by sarscov2 the phase 3 cove study was designed in collaboration with the fda and nih to evaluate vaccine efficacy in americans at risk of severe covid19 disease and completed enrollment of more than 30000 participants ages 18 and older in the us on october 22 2020 including those at high risk of severe complications of covid19 disease in early september 2020 we announced that we were slowing enrollment in the trial to ensure representation of communities of color in the cove study final enrollment in the study included more than 11000 participants from communities of color representing 37 of the study population 

on december 30 2020 interim safety and primary efficacy results from the phase 3 trial of mrna1273 were published in the new england journal of medicine  the primary endpoint of the phase 3 cove study was based on the analysis of covid19 cases confirmed and adjudicated starting two weeks following the second dose of vaccine this final analysis was based on 196 cases of which 185 cases of covid19 were observed in the placebo group versus 11 cases observed in the moderna covid19 vaccine group corresponding to a 94 vaccine efficacy 95 ci 893968 p00001 this efficacy is highlighted in the chart below the most common solicited adverse reactions ars after the twodose series was injection site pain 860 solicited systemic adverse events occurred more often in the moderna covid19 vaccine group 549 and 794 than in the placebo 422 and 365 group after both the first dose and the second dose respectively and were most commonly headache fatigue and myalgia while the majority of these ars were mild grade 1 or moderate grade 2 there was a higher occurrence of severe grade 3 reactions in the moderna covid19 vaccine group after the first 29 and second 158 injections the majority of local solicited ars occurred within the first one to two days after injection and generally persisted for a median of one to two days safety data continues to accrue and the study continues to be monitored by an independent data safety monitoring board dsmb appointed by the nih all participants in the cove study will be monitored for two years after their second dose to assess longterm protection and safety additional data to be collected will include longer term safety followup duration of protection against covid19 and efficacy against asymptomatic sarscov2 infection all placebo recipients in the phase 2 and phase 3 trials have been offered our covid19 vaccine as of february 15 2020 over 80 of placebo recipients have received at least one dose of our covid19 vaccine 

we are also conducting a phase 23 study of mrna1273 in adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age and a phase 23 pediatric study in children less than 12 years old is expected to begin in april 2021 finally to assess the ability of a third vaccination with mrna1273 to further boost antibody titers participants in the active arms 100 and 50ug of our phase 2 adult study will be offered a 50ug booster dose additional studies are planned to evaluate mrna1273 in special risk groups such as the immunocompromised 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 regulatory updates 

on december 18 2020 the us food and drug administration authorized the emergency use of mrna1273 moderna’s vaccine against covid19 in individuals 18 years of age or older our covid19 vaccine has also been authorized for emergency or conditional use by regulatory authorities in canada israel the united kingdom the european union switzerland singapore and qatar additional authorizations are currently under review in additional markets and by the world health organization who we expect to submit a biologics license application or bla to the fda for approval of mrna1273 and to submit applications with other regulatory authorities for similar approvals which will allow for the commercial sale and distribution of the vaccine after the pandemic subsides and conditions are no longer met for emergency or conditional use authorizations 

covid19 vaccine mrna1273 commercial manufacturing and supply updates 

as of december 31 2020 we have signed supply agreements to deliver approximately 520 million doses of mrna1273 in 2021 for total contract consideration of 117 billion we have confirmed the following supply agreements as of that date united states 200 million doses with option for an additional 300 million doses european union 160 million doses japan 50 million doses canada 40 million doses with option for an additional 16 million doses south korea 40 million doses united kingdom 17 million doses switzerland 75 million doses israel 6 million doses we also signed agreements with qatar singapore and other countries for which order amounts were not disclosed 

during 2021 and through the date of this annual report on form 10k we have agreed to additional supply agreements or received option exercises for additional doses as follows united states 100 million doses with an option remaining for 200 million doses european union 150 million doses with an option remaining for 150 million doses in 2022 subject to final execution of the purchase agreement following the expiration of the opt out period for eu member states canada 4 million doses colombia 10 million doses and taiwan 5 million doses 

our base case global production estimate is 700 million to 1 billion doses for 2021 we are continuing to invest and add staff as we meet production at the high end of this range we are also working on increasing our potential supply to up to 14 billion doses for 2022 based upon the current 100 µg dose much of the production for the supply of the us market will be completed at our mtc facility in norwood massachusetts with additional production by lonza ltd for the us market we have also partnered with lonza to complete all production of mrna1273 for markets other than the us in switzerland fillfinish services for mrna1273 are provided by catalent inc in the us and by rovi and recipharm outside the us 

we believe that the conditions under which mrna1273 can be shipped and stored are a key feature of our vaccine as such conditions provide for greater flexibility in distributing the vaccine to markets where special handling may be a barrier to distribution mrna1273 does not require dilution prior to use and remains stable at 2° to 8°c 36° to 46°f the temperature of a standard home or medical refrigerator for 30 days mrna1273 remains stable at 20° c 4°f for up to six months at refrigerated conditions for up to 30 days and at room temperature for up to 12 hours 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 

we are developing a combination vaccine to address two viruses that are leading causes of respiratory infection 

human metapneumovirus or hmpv and human parainfluenza virus 3 or piv3 are significant causes of respiratory tract infections in children despite the substantial impact hmpv and piv3 have on human health attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to other respiratory infections like respiratory syncytial virus rsv to date no vaccine to prevent hmpv or piv3 infections has been approved our platform allows us to combine mrnas encoding antigens for the two pathogens in one combination vaccine enabling a single vaccine that could protect against both respiratory infections in our approach we utilize mrna sequences encoding for the membrane fusion f glycoproteins or f proteins for each of the viruses we have generated safety tolerability and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 trial for mrna1653 in the united states which has been completed based on these data we have a phase 1b trial for mrna1653 ongoing in the united states in healthy adults and children aged 1259 months 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 disease overview 

hmpv and piv3 have a substantial impact on human health yet have lagged in research and attention relative to rsv 

there is no approved vaccine for hmpv although this rna virus has been determined to be one of the more frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections hmpv has been detected in 4 to 15 of patients with acute respiratory infections hmpv causes disease primarily in young children but can also infect adults the elderly and immunocompromised individuals clinical signs of infection range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to lifethreatening severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia hmpv was discovered in 2001 and identified as a leading cause of respiratory infection 

there is no approved vaccine for piv3 although this rna virus is recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections in children infections from parainfluenza virus or piv account for up to 7 of acute respiratory infections among children younger than 5 years of the four piv types identified piv3 most frequently results in infections and leads to the more serious lower respiratory tract infections compared to the other three piv types though piv3 related infections were identified in the past awareness of their burden to patients and hospitals has risen over the past several years 

awareness of hospitalizations due to hmpv or piv3 infections have risen and we believe that a single combined vaccine intended for active immunization of infants against both hmpv and piv3 would be valuable previous attempts at developing a vaccine have focused on only hmpv or piv alone with no known attempts at a combination vaccine 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 our product concept 

our approach is to develop a combination vaccine for all infants 

mrna1653 is a single investigational vaccine consisting of two distinct mrna sequences that encode the membrane f proteins of hmpv and piv3 coformulated in our proprietary lnp 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 preclinical information 

our mrna vaccine is immunogenic and protective in preclinical multiple species 

we have evaluated multiple combinations for hmpvpiv3 mrna vaccines encoding fulllength f proteins for hmpv and piv3 viruses in mice sprague dawley rats cotton rats and african green monkeys each following intramuscular injection these studies demonstrate that mrna encoding for f proteins from these viruses induce robust hmpv and piv3 neutralizing antibody titers in all species tested further we have demonstrated that our hmpv and piv3 mrna combination vaccine does not lead to vaccineenhanced respiratory disease evaluated in cotton rats and is protective against hmpv or piv3 viral challenge evaluated in cotton rats and african green monkeys 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 clinical data 

we have generated safety tolerability and immunogenicity data from a phase 1 trial in the us which has been completed based on the data we have a phase 1b trial in healthy adults and children aged 1259 months ongoing in the us 

a firstinhuman doseranging study mrna1653p101 in healthy adults n  124 was completed in january 2020 this study evaluated the safety reactogenicity and immunogenicity of a range of dose levels 25 75 150 or 300 µg administered on a 1dose or 2dose vaccination schedule approximately 28 days apart compared with a placebo control in healthy adult subjects 18 through 49 years of age with a 13 month followup period the mrna1653 vaccine was generally welltolerated at all dose levels there were no deaths or adverse events of special interest reported during the study no subject was withdrawn from the study due to an unsolicited adverse event injection site pain was the most commonly reported solicited adverse event and the most common grade 3 adverse event neutralizing antibodies against hmpv and piv3 were present at baseline in all subjects consistent with prior exposure 

to both viruses a single dose of mrna1653 boosted serum neutralization titers against hmpv and piv3 and the magnitude of the boost was similar at all dose levels the month 1 to baseline geometric mean ratio gmr for the pooled mrna1653 treatment groups was approximately 6 for hmpv and 3 for piv3 a second vaccination did not impact the magnitude of hmpv or piv3 neutralization titers measured at month 2 the hmpv neutralizing antibody titers remained above baseline at all dose levels through month 13 and the piv3 neutralizing antibody titers remained above baseline at all dose levels through month 7 

we are conducting a phase 1b trial to evaluate mrna1653 in healthy adults and children aged 1259 months the phase 1b trial is a randomized observerblinded placebocontrolled doseranging trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of mrna1653 in healthy adults 1849 years of age and three dose levels in children 1259 months of age with serologic evidence of prior hmpv and piv3 exposure the adult cohort includes 24 adults randomized in the ratio 111 to receive two doses of 30 μg of mrna1653 150 μg of mrna1653 or placebo two months apart as of january 2021 the adult cohort has been completed and the pediatric portion is ongoing 

rsv vaccine mrna1345 

we are developing an rsv vaccine for children and older adults we intend to explore a combination vaccine with mrna1653 our hmpvpiv3 vaccine andor other respiratory viruses to address a wide array of viral respiratory illness in these populations 

respiratory syncytial virus or rsv is one of the most common causes of respiratory disease in children under the age of five and also in older adults the rsv vaccine mrna1345 is our first rsv vaccine to enter the clinic with the same proprietary lnp as our covid19 vaccine we previously had two different rsv candidates in partnership with merck mrna1777 and mrna1172 enter the clinic mrna1345 was initially nominated as a pediatric vaccine for rsv in october 2020 we announced that we regained the rights to adult rsv vaccines from merck and will be moving mrna1345 into the adult population 

rsv vaccine mrna1345 disease overview 

rsv is the leading cause of unaddressed severe lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization in infants and young children worldwide and causes a substantial burden of illness in older adults 

rsv causes upper and lower respiratory tract illness worldwide and is transmitted primarily via aerosolized droplets from an infected person or via contamination of environmental surfaces with infectious secretions upper respiratory symptoms typically begin within several days of exposure in healthy adults the infection may remain confined to the upper respiratory tract however in those with compromised immune systems such as premature infants the elderly or individuals with underlying respiratory disease lower respiratory tract infections commonly occur and may manifest as wheezing bronchiolitis pneumonia hospitalization or even death infections with rsv follow a seasonal pattern occurring primarily in the northern hemisphere between the months of november and april and in the southern hemisphere primarily between march and october 

rsv is a common cause of respiratory tract illness in children with most infected at least once by two years of age in the united states it is estimated that over two million children younger than five years of age receive medical attention and more than 86000 are hospitalized due to rsv infection annually globally it is estimated that rsv is responsible for over approximately 33 million episodes of acute lowerrespiratory tract infection 32 million hospitalizations and as many as 118000 deaths per year in children younger than five years of age rsv also causes a substantial burden of respiratory illness in older adults rsv infection causes an estimated 17700 hospitalizations and 14000 deaths per year in adults aged 65 years in the united states to date no effective vaccine to prevent rsv has been approved and the only approved prophylactic treatment is the monoclonal antibody mab palivizumab marketed as synagis in the united states for the prevention of serious lower respiratory disease caused by rsv in pediatric patients at high risk for rsv infection 

rsv vaccine mrna1345 product concept 

prevent rsv disease in young children and older adults with an improved rsv antigen and our proprietary lnp formulation 

mrna1345 encodes an engineered form of the rsv f proteins stabilized in the prefusion conformation and is formulated in our proprietary lnp the f protein is present as a homotrimer on the surface of rsv the prefusion conformation of the f protein interacts with a host cell membrane and the conformational change from prefusion to postfusion drives virus fusion with a host cell the majority of rsvspecific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent people are directed to epitopes present only on the prefusion conformation of the f protein the prefusion state of the f protein elicits a superior neutralizing antibody response compared to the postfusion state in animal studies conducted by others we believe that neutralizing antibodies elicited by mrna1345 may lead to an efficacious rsv vaccine 

rsv vaccine mrna1345 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated that the rsv vaccine mrna1345 induces robust rsv neutralizing antibody titers in mice for example the left panel below shows the results of a study in which mice were immunized with different dose levels of mrna1345 intramuscularly on study days 1 and 21 and rsv neutralizing antibody titers were measured in serum collected on day 33 when compared to the results of a similar mouse study conducted with mrna from mrna1777 formulated in the same proprietary lnp as mrna1345 mrna1345 was shown to be significantly more immunogenic we have leveraged our body of nonclinical clinical and cmc experience from our vaccine portfolio to expedite preclinical development of our rsv mrna1345 vaccine 

serum neutralizing titers in mice for mrna1345 and for mrna1777 mrna formulated in our same proprietary lnp 

clinical trials of a formalininactivated rsv vaccine conducted in the 1960s resulted in higher rates of severe rsv disease in vaccinated infants than in control infants a finding referred to as vaccine enhanced respiratory disease erd it is thought that nucleic acidbased vaccines including mrna present a lower risk of erd because of their biologic similarities with live virus given that the rsv vaccine mrna1345 is designed to enable intracellular production of prefusion f protein by a person’s own cells we believe that it likely recapitulates the antigenic presentation and immune cell stimulation as seen with natural infection further the mrna1777 rsv vaccine did not predispose for erd in a cotton rat rsv model espeseth et al npj vaccines 2020516 to provide further confirmation that the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 does not present a risk for erd additional preclinical studies will be conducted prior to clinical development of mrna1345 in rsv seronegative children or infants 

rsv vaccine mrna1345 clinical plan 

we are conducting a phase 1 trial for mrna1345 in healthy younger adults healthy older adults and rsvseropositive children the phase 1 trial is a randomized observerblind placebocontrolled dose escalation study to evaluate the safety reactogenicity and immunogenicity of three dose levels of mrna1345 in healthy younger adults aged 18 to 49 years and healthy older adults aged 6579 years and two dose levels in rsvseropositive children aged 1259 months as of january 2021 3 of the 4 younger adult cohorts are fully enrolled and we began enrollment for the older adult cohort in february 2021 

seasonal influenza vaccine mrna1010 mrna1020 and mrna1030 

three development candidates will be assessed in a phase 1 study planned to start in 2021 mouse immunization studies have shown strong immune responses against the vaccine antigens 

seasonal influenza viruses are estimated by the who to cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and up to 650000 deaths each year resulting in a severe challenge to public health currently licensed seasonal influenza virus vaccines rarely exceed 60 overall effectiveness and are poorly effective during years when the circulating viruses do not match the strains selected for the vaccine antigens particularly in older adults the population most affected by severe influenza outcomes vaccine effectiveness remains low mrna influenza vaccines could provide several benefits compared to current vaccines including the ability to more quickly respond to strain changes avoidance of mutations that may be acquired during vaccine production in eggs or cell culture and stronger immune responses and improved protection in older adults we are planning to test three development candidates mrna1010 mrna1020 and mrna1030 in a phase 1 study starting in 2021 which will allow us to identify a candidate to take forward into pivotal efficacy studies the vaccine will be administered as a single dose and will aim to elicit protection from all seasonal influenza viruses in the future we also plan to evaluate the combination of a seasonal influenza vaccine with vaccines against other respiratory viruses with similar epidemiology 

seasonal influenza vaccine mrna1010 mrna1020 and mrna1030 disease overview 

influenza most substantially impacts young children and older adults and current vaccines show low effectiveness 

influenza epidemics occur each year and manifest in mild to severe forms common symptoms of influenza infection include fever runny nose sore throat muscle pain and coughing the symptoms onset generally occurs within two days after infection and in uncomplicated cases the disease is selflimiting and resolves within a week however influenza virus infection can lead to severe disease especially in high risk groups including older adults and individuals with comorbidities and even death 290000650000 respiratory deaths worldwide annually 

influenza viruses follow a seasonal circulation pattern with increased cases during the winter months in the northern and southern hemispheres respectively since influenza viruses continuously change through a process termed antigenic drift the circulating viruses are actively monitored by a worldwide monitoring network coordinated by the who based on the observed circulation patterns and antigenic changes an expert panel recommends influenza virus strains to be used for vaccine manufacturing twice a year once for the northern and once for the southern hemisphere influenza a and influenza b viruses are the most relevant influenza viruses for human infection therefore current recommendations include one influenza a h1n1 strain one influenza a h3n2 strain and two influenza b strains covering the bvictoria and byamagata lineages 

seasonal influenza vaccine mrna1010 mrna1020 and mrna1030 product concept 

prevent influenza virus infections by annual vaccination against circulating seasonal influenza viruses 

our investigational products will aim to elicit protective antibodies against circulating seasonal influenza viruses three products will be tested in the clinic in 2021 with the goal of selecting one product to move forward into pivotal studies the final product is expected to be updated twice a year for the northern and southern hemispheres respectively based on the recommendations by who and will include antigens of the four strains recommended for seasonal vaccines an mrnabased influenza vaccine has a number of potential advantages over vaccines produced using traditional manufacturing processes such as avoiding mutations to proteins acquired by passage during egg or cellpropagation of viruses presentation of antigens in their natural conformation better immunogenicity in older adults and more rapid manufacturing timelines 

seasonal influenza vaccine mrna1010 mrna1020 and mrna1030 preclinical information 

preclinical studies show that strong serum antibody responses against all antigens are elicited after a single administration of the mrna vaccines in mice even at low mrna dose levels 

prophylactic vaccines vaccines requiring complex antigens and against highly prevalent infections 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 

our cmv program targets congenital cmv infections to reduce or prevent birth defects 

congenital cytomegalovirus or cmv infection is the leading cause of birth defects in the united states despite several attempts to date there is no vaccine approved to prevent congenital transmission of cmv we believe that in addition to the glycoprotein b or gb protein antigen a successful cmv vaccine would need to include the pentamer a 5protein membranebound antigen complex required for epithelial endothelial and myeloid cell infection by the virus a cmv vaccine containing the pentamer as a recombinant protein or a replication defective virus is complex to make and scale we used our platform to generate an mrna vaccine designed to make the pentamer in its natural membranebound conformation this investigational medicine is designed to prevent or control cmv infection and includes five mrnas encoding for the pentamer as well as one mrna encoding for cmv gb that has previously demonstrated partial clinical efficacy the phase 1 and 2 trials for mrna1647 has generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity based on recent data from the 3month interim analysis data from the phase 2 trial we have selected a dose and initiated planning for phase 3 trials for mrna1647 in the united states canada europe australia and israel 

cmv mrna1647 disease overview 

cmv is a major cause of birth defects with no approved vaccine 

human cmv is a common human pathogen and member of the herpes virus family seropositivity demonstrating prior exposure to virus increases with age and is approximately 4060 in women of childbearing potential in the united states however general awareness of cmv is not high less than 1020 of adults are aware of cmv and most healthy adults after initial primary cmv infection do not have symptoms however approximately 0607 of newborns are congenitally infected by cmv annually in industrialized countries congenital cmv results from infected mothers transmitting the virus to their unborn child and it is the leading cause of birth defects with approximately 25000 newborns per year in the united states infected birth defects occur in approximately 20 of infected babies and include permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities which can include hearing loss often permanent vision impairment varying degrees of learning disability decreased muscle strength and coordination and even death some studies report approximately onethird of infants with severe congenital disease will die within the first year of life and the survivors their caregivers and health systems bear significant longterm burdens 

there is currently no available vaccine for cmv and many previous attempts at developing a vaccine to reduce or prevent congenital transmission have been missing a key antigen the pentamer we believe the pentamer is critical for the infection of epithelial endothelial and myeloid cells by the virus we believe the pentamer was not included in certain prior recombinant protein vaccine attempts due to the complexity of producing it as a multiunit antigen complex prior vaccine studies demonstrated insufficient efficacy against cmv infection and limited durability of immune response a vaccine that leads to durable immunity in women of childbearing age would address a critical unmet need in the prevention of congenital cmv infection 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 our product concept 

we are developing a single vaccine with complex antigens to prevent or control infection 

our ability to generate a multiantigen vaccine enables us to combine a traditional target antigen gb with the pentamer in order to specifically focus the immune system on these important antigens we believe this gives us greater potential to produce neutralizing antibodies that can block cmv transmission from the mother to the fetus our approach to block transmission could either be 

• direct by vaccinating adolescents or adults of childbearing potential female and male or 

• indirect by vaccinating toddlers who could spread cmv to each other their mothers and their childcare workers 

unlike a proteinbased or liveattenuated vaccine our mrna instructs cells to specifically make predetermined antigens with a structure that mimics the one presented to the immune system by the virus thus focusing the immune system on these important antigens 

mrna1647 comprises six mrnas that encode for these known hardtomake cmv antigens in a proprietary lnp 

• in cmv seropositive individuals the majority of neutralizing antibodies target the pentamer the cmv pentamer is made by five cmv glycoproteins that form a membranebound complex the pentamer is required for cmv entry into epithelial endothelial and myeloid cells the mrnaexpressed pentamer is displayed on the surface of the cell and stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies that prevent the virus from entering the cells 

• gb is a trimeric cmv membrane glycoprotein that abundantly resides on the surface of the viral particles fusion between virus and host cells and hence infection requires gb antibodies to gb can prevent cmv infection gb has been utilized in some earlier attempts at a cmv vaccine as the sole antigen which had resulted in partial efficacy but not at levels sufficient for approval 

an illustration of our proposed approach for cmv is shown in the figure below 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 preclinical information 

we have published preclinical data for our cmv vaccine 

we have demonstrated that the pentamer and gb mrnas can elicit potent and durable antibody titers against the antigens in mice and nonhuman primates and have published these results in the journal vaccine in 2018 in one study mice were immunized with the pentamer and gb mrnas encapsulated in our proprietary lnp serum samples were taken from the mice at specific timepoints postvaccination postvaccination neutralizing titers were measured by admixing serial dilutions of each sample with cmv virus incubating the mixture in a human primary epithelial cell culture and counting the number of infected cells we used cytogam an approved product for prevention of cmv in transplant patients as a control in our experiment cytogam is cytomegalovirus immune globulin from pooled plasma of cmv seropositive donors the table below shows the neutralization antibody titers in epithelial cells for escalating vaccine doses in mice demonstrating our ability to generate neutralizing antibodies we also observed that at the highest dose our mrna vaccine generated a response more than 75fold higher than cytogam at estimated clinical levels in addition we have also observed that the pentamer and gb mrnas can elicit strong t cell responses 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 clinical data 

we have demonstrated tolerability and generated immunogenicity data in our phase 1 and 2 trials based on interim phase 2 data we have initiated planning a phase 3 trial of mrna1647 vaccine efficacy 

phase 1 12month interim analysis 

we announced positive data from the 12month interim analysis of the phase 1 clinical trial of mrna1647 which has completed the final study visit of its last participant and is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1647 in 181 healthy adult volunteers 

the clinical trial population includes those who are naïve to cmv infection cmvseronegative and those who had previously been infected by cmv cmvseropositive participants were randomized to receive either placebo or 30 90 180 or 300 µg of mrna1647 on a dosing schedule of 0 2 and 6 months this 12month planned interim analysis assessed immunogenicity of the first three dose levels 30 90 and 180 µg at 12 months six months after the third vaccination and the highest dose level 300 µg at seven months one month after the third vaccination the analysis also assessed safety of the highest dose level at seven months neutralizing antibody titers levels of circulating antibodies that block infection were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts which measure immune response to the pentamer and gb vaccine antigens respectively gb antigenspecific t cell responses after the second and third vaccinations were measured in a subset of cmvseronegative participants in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels utilizing an elispot assay pentamerspecific t cell assays remain in development vaccineinduced neutralizing antibody responses in the cmvseronegative group were compared to the baseline neutralizing antibody titers in the cmvseropositive group noting that prior maternal cmv infection is associated with an approximately 30fold lower risk of congenital cmv infection compared to the risk in the setting of maternal primary cmv infection 

in cmvseronegative participants at seven months one month after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

• a doserelated increase in neutralizing antibody titers was observed in both epithelial cell and fibroblast assays 

• after the third vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against epithelial cell infection were greater than 10 times higher in the 90 and 180 µg dose levels than cmvseropositive baseline titers at the 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

• after the third vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against fibroblast infection were 13 to 14 times higher than cmvseropositive baseline titers at the 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

in cmvseronegative participants at twelve months six months after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

• neutralizing antibody titers remained at least 35fold higher than the natural infection benchmark in epithelial cell assays 

• titers in fibroblast assays approximated that of the natural infection benchmark in the in the 90 μg and 180 μg treatment groups 

in cmvseropositive participants at seven months one month after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

• a doserelated increase in neutralizing antibody titers was observed in both epithelial cell and fibroblast assays 

• the third vaccination boosted neutralizing antibody titers against epithelial cell infection to levels of 22fold to 40fold over baseline titers in all dose levels 

• the third vaccination boosted neutralizing antibody titers against fibroblast infection to levels of approximately 4fold to 6fold over baseline titers in all dose levels 

in cmvseropositive participants at twelve months six months after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

• neutralizing antibody titers were 14fold to 31fold over baseline titers in epithelial cell assays 

• titers in fibroblast assays were 6fold to 8fold over baseline titers 

participants receiving 300 µg of mrna1647 followed through seven months one month after the third vaccination continued to show consistent dosedependent increases in neutralizing antibodies against epithelial cell infection and against fibroblast infection in both cmvseronegative and cmvseropositive groups in cmvseronegative participants at seven months the neutralizing antibody titers in epithelial cell assays increased further to 17fold higher than the natural infection benchmark and neutralizing antibody titers in fibroblast assays increased further to 5fold higher than natural infection benchmark in cmvseropositive participants at seven months the neutralizing antibody titers in epithelial cell assays was 134fold over baseline titers and against fibroblast infection was 71fold over baseline titer in a subset of cmvseronegative participants in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels gb antigenspecific t cell activation was observed at all dose levels after the second and third vaccinations 

a safety analysis indicated that the vaccine was generally welltolerated there were no vaccinerelated serious adverse events across all mrna1647 treatment groups the most common solicited local adverse reaction or ar was injection site pain and the most common solicited systemic ars were headache fatigue myalgia arthralgia and chills fever was reported in 055 of cmvseronegative treatment groups and in 875 of cmvseropositive treatment groups in general solicited systemic ars occurred less frequently after the third vaccination compared to the second and were more common in the cmvseropositive treatment groups compared to the cmvseronegative treatment groups grade 3 solicited ars were more common in cmvseropositive participants and were fatigue 027 of a given dose cohort chills 038 of a given dose cohort and fever 033 of a given dose cohort as reported in the previous interim analysis there was a single grade 4 ar of an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time which was elevated at baseline grade 1 and selfresolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings safety and tolerability in participants receiving 300 µg of mrna1647 was comparable to that observed at the 180 µg dose level in cmvseropositive participants and generally higher in 300 µg dose level in cmvseronegative participants 

although the small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the data the findings from this interim analysis build on an earlier interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity data through one month after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels and one month after the second vaccination in the 300 µg dose level 

phase 2 part 1 3month interim analysis 

in part 1 of the phase 2 study participants were randomized to receive either placebo or 50 100 or 150 µg of mrna1647 on a dosing schedule of 0 2 and 6 months the planned 3month interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity through 3 months 1 month after the second vaccination in september 2020 informed the selection of the 100 µg dose level for the phase 3 pivotal efficacy study in addition we have initiated enrollment in part 2 of the phase 2 study which is evaluating safety and immunogenicity of the 100 µg dose level to expand the safety dataset in the target population planned for the phase 3 study 

in cmvseronegative participants at three months one month after the second vaccination in the 50 100 and 150 µg dose levels 

• neutralizing antibody titers against epithelial cell infection increased to at least 12fold over the cmvseropositive baseline titers after the second vaccination and were generally numerically similar in the 50 100 and 150 μg treatment groups 

• neutralizing antibody titers against fibroblast infection increased to titers equivalent to the cmvseropositive baseline titers after the second vaccination and were generally numerically similar in the 50 100 and 150 μg treatment groups 

in cmvseropositive participants at three months one month after the second vaccination in the 50 100 and 150 µg dose levels 

• neutralizing antibody titers against epithelial cell infection increased 12 to 51fold over the cmvseropositive baseline titers after the second vaccination 

• neutralizing antibody titers against fibroblast infection increased to levels at least 2fold over cmvseropositive baseline titers after the first and second vaccination 

phase 2 continuation and phase 3 planning 

our randomized observerblind placebocontrolled doseconfirmation phase 2 study is investigating the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1647 in approximately 252 healthy cmvseronegative and cmvseropositive adult volunteers in part 1 of the study and an additional approximately 250 healthy cmvseronegative and cmvseropositive female volunteers in part 2 of the study in the us 

we are actively preparing for a global randomized observerblind placebocontrolled phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mrna1647 against primary cmv infection in females 1640 years of age we solicited and received type c meeting feedback from the fda on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial requested an endofphase 2 eop2 meeting with fda for midmarch 2021 and submitted our phase 3 development plans to fda in a briefing document we believe this can be achieved with a trial with no more than 8000 participants and study site selection andor site feasibility has already begun across north america europe australia and israel the pivotal phase 3 trial design will be finalized after discussion with the fda and other global health authorities additional adolescent bridging and concomitant vaccination trials are being planned 

epsteinbarr virus vaccine mrna1189 

our ebv vaccine seeks to prevent the development of infectious mononucleosis and potentially prevent ebv infection 

epsteinbarr virus or ebv a member of the herpesvirus family that includes cmv infects approximately 90 of people by adulthood with primary infection typically occurring during childhood and late adolescence approximately 50 and 89 seropositivity respectively in the us ebv is the major cause of infectious mononucleosis in the us accounting for over 90 of the approximately 12 million cases of infectious mononucleosis in the us each year infectious mononucleosis can debilitate patients for weeks to months and in some cases can lead to hospitalization and splenic rupture ebv infection is associated with the development and progression of certain lymphoproliferative disorders cancers and autoimmune diseases in particular ebv infection and infectious mononucleosis are associated with increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system there is no approved vaccine or effective treatment for ebv similar to cmv ebv has lytic and latent stages in its lifecycle and contains on its surface envelope multiple glycoproteins and glycoprotein complexes gp350 ghgl ghglgp42 and gb that mediate virus entry and infection in different cell types ebv gp350 mediates attachment to b cells through binding to the complement receptor 2 cr2 followed by binding of the viral ghglgp42 complex to human leukocyte antigen hla class ii infection of epithelial cells instead requires binding of ghgl to a different set of receptors for both b cell and epithelial cell entry binding of an ebv ghgl complex to a cellspecific receptor leads to activation of gb which in turn facilitates viruscellmembrane fusion and infection ghgl and gb comprise the core viralfusion machinery conserved across all herpesviruses 

similar to our cmv vaccine mrna1647 product concept we used our platform to generate an mrna vaccine containing five mrnas encoding for gp350 gb gh gl and gp42 which are expressed in their native membranebound conformation for recognition by the immune system we have observed preclinical immunogenicity in the form of high and durable levels of antigenspecific antibodies against both b cell and epithelial cell infection in mice and in nonhuman primates nhps we intend to conduct a phase 1 trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine to understand its potential to prevent primary infection and prevent infectious mononucleosis following ebv infection in seronegative adults 

epsteinbarr virus disease overview 

ebv is the major cause approximately 90 of infectious mononucleosis and has been associated with the development of a range of malignancies and autoimmune disorders 

ebv is a common herpesvirus that is spread through bodily fluids most commonly saliva and is contracted primarily by young children and adolescents adolescents and young adults seroconvert at high rates particularly in collegeaged populations approximately 1025 per year resulting a seroprevalence of approximately 90 by the age of 20 after primary infection the virus establishes latency and persists in that state for life in most infected individuals the virus can reactivate intermittently over time even in immunocompetent hosts the virus usually infects resting b cells in the oropharynx or epithelial cells which line the mucosal surfaces of the body and in turn infect b cells b cells disseminate systemically and act as a reservoir for latent virus primary infection can cause infectious mononucleosis in 35 to 75 of instances depending on age and is characterized by symptoms requiring physician visits including sore throat lymph node swelling fever body aches and fatigue often resulting in months of missed work and school for patients and caregivers 

there is currently no approved vaccine against ebv but the potential of gp350 alone to reduce the rate of infectious mononucleosis has already been clinically demonstrated an experimental vaccine developed by others consisting of adjuvanted recombinant gp350 protein led to a reduction in the incidence of infectious mononucleosis in 78 of the participants in a phase 2 study of 181 healthy volunteers between the ages of 1625 however there was no significant difference between groups in protection against asymptomatic ebv infection we believe that the addition of ghgl and gb has the potential to provide protection against epithelial cell infection we believe the immune response against gp350 ghgl or gb has the potential to provide b cell protection which may be further enhanced by the inclusion of gp42 by preventing infection in epithelial cells and b cells this mrna vaccine has the potential not only to significantly reduce the rate of infectious mononucleosis but also to prevent ebv infection 

ebv infection is associated with increased risk of developing certain cancers and multiple sclerosis in western industrialized countries ebv is implicated in the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder conditions as well as multiple cancers including hodgkin’s lymphoma additionally in those seropositive for ebv development of infectious mononucleosis is associated with a greater than 2fold increased relative lifetime risk of developing multiple sclerosis in east asia ebv is associated with 8099 of nasopharyngeal carcinomas that arise in africa ebv is implicated in the development of approximately 95 of cases of endemic burkitt’s lymphoma together approximately 15 of worldwide cancer deaths are attributable to ebvassociated malignancies 

ebv vaccine mrna1189 our product concept 

we are developing a vaccine with multiple antigens designed to prevent development of infectious mononucleosis and ebv infections 

similar to our cmv vaccine mrna1647 product concept we believe that an effective ebv vaccine must generate an immune response to antigens that are required for viral entry in most of the susceptible cell types we have thus designed our ebv vaccine mrna1189 to elicit an immune response to ebv envelope glycoproteins gp350 as well as gb gp42 and the ghgl complex which are required for infection of both epithelial and b cells mrna1189 contains five mrnas encoding the viral proteins gp350 gb gp42 gh and gl encapsulated in our proprietary lnps proteins translated from our mrna will be displayed on the cell surface in their native conformation stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies by training the immune system to recognize and neutralize the machinery used to infect b and epithelial cells we believe that our vaccine has the potential to prevent ebv primary infection and therefore the development of infectious mononucleosis further in the longrun should our ebv vaccine be approved we may pursue postmarketing and population studies to potentially evaluate its impact on other ebvassociated diseases our ebv vaccine utilizes the same proprietary platform technology as our cmv vaccine mrna1647 which was generally welltolerated and demonstrated durable neutralizing antibody titers higher than those measured in cmvseropositive patients following up to three doses of mrna1647 in our phase 1 trial 

ebv vaccine mrna1189 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to induce antibodies against ebv antigens required for viral entry into b cells and epithelial cells 

naïve balbc mice were given two doses of a vaccine against ebv antigens in combination approximately four weeks apart antibody titers against viral proteins involved in epithelial cell entry ghgl and gb or b cell entry gp350 ghgl and gb were measured in peripheral blood at day 57 results shown here represent five animals per group and demonstrate high levels of antigenspecific immunoglobulin g igg as compared to negative controls 

ebv vaccine mrna1189 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1189 in seronegative adults 

we intend to conduct a phase 1 trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine to understand its potential to prevent primary infection and prevent infectious mononucleosis following ebv infection in seronegative adults 

prophylactic vaccines global health programs 

our global health portfolio for prophylactic vaccines seeks to leverage our mrna technology to address epidemic and pandemic diseases we are currently working with strategic collaborators such as barda darpa nih the bill and melinda gates foundation and the international aids vaccine initiative iavi to fund and support our programs within this area 

zika vaccine mrna1893 

in collaboration with barda we have advanced a second generation zika vaccine candidate to a phase 1 clinical trial 

zika is an infectious disease caused by the zika virus infection during pregnancy has been linked to severe brain damage in infants with congenital infection and guillainbarré syndrome in adults to date no vaccine to prevent zika infection has been approved in september 2016 we were awarded a contract with barda to be reimbursed up to approximately 1250 million for the development of a zika mrna vaccine preclinical and clinical studies were carried out on an initial candidate mrna1325 when a secondgeneration zika vaccine mrna1893 demonstrated better protection than mrna1325 in nonhuman primates at 120 of the dose we decided to move forward with mrna1893 and discontinue development of mrna1325 mrna1893 is currently under evaluation in a phase 1 trial in the united states enrollment and dosing are complete and the interim analysis is available 

zika vaccine mrna1893 disease overview 

we faced a zika epidemic in 2015 for which there were no vaccines or treatments 

the zika virus is a single stranded rna virus of the flaviviridae family it was first isolated in a rhesus macaque in the zika forest uganda in 1947 and the first human case was documented in 1952 seroepidemiology data suggest that it is endemic to regions of africa and asia where the aedes mosquito vectors are found zika virus is predominantly spread by mosquitos from the aedes genus but it can also be transmitted congenitally sexually and through blood donation 

zika infection is usually asymptomatic or mild in adults leading to fever rash and conjunctivitis however infection of women during pregnancy can result in devastating microcephaly in newborns microcephaly is a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head and brain associated with lifelong neurodevelopmental delay seizures intellectual disability balance problems and dwarfism  short stature resulting in significant disability and requiring lifelong support 

in 2007 a zika infection outbreak progressed across the pacific islands an outbreak observed in brazil in 2015 soon spread across the americas this led to the who declaring it a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 during the period there were tens of thousands of cases of microcephaly and congenital zika syndrome reported in infants and of resulting neurological sequelae such as guillainbarré syndrome reported in adults 

while the number of cases has declined in the past couple of years there is currently no treatment or vaccine available for the zika virus to prevent and respond to potential future epidemics 

zika vaccine mrna1893 our product concept 

a more immunogenic secondgeneration vaccine was rapidly advanced to a phase 1 clinical trial 

continued efforts at identifying different mrna sequences with improved immunogenicity led to mrna1893 a sequence distinct from the first zika vaccine candidate mrna1325 that increases production of zika virallike particles vlps and generates enhanced immunogenicity and protection in preclinical animal models compared with mrna1325 as depicted in the image below 

zika vaccine mrna1893 clinical data 

we are conducting a phase 1 trial for mrna1893 in the united states the results of the phase 1 study support continued clinical development of mrna1893 and a phase 2 study is planned for initiation in 2021 

dosing has been completed in a phase 1 randomized observerblind placebocontrolled doseranging study to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna1893 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age inclusive in endemic and nonendemic zika regions key objectives of the study include 

• assessing the safety tolerability and reactogenicity of a 2‑dose vaccination schedule of mrna1893 zika vaccine given 28 days apart across a range of dose levels in flavivirusseronegative and flavivirusseropositive participants compared with placebo 

• assessing the immunogenicity of a range of doses of mrna1893 zika vaccine 

subjects were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion in an approximate 41 ratio to receive mrna1893 or placebo at one of four dose levels 10 µg 30 µg 100 µg and 250 µg with each subject receiving two vaccinations separated by 28 days twentyfive of the enrolled participants at each dose level were flavivirus seronegative and five were flavivirus seropositive 

mrna1893 was well tolerated at all dose levels and safety and tolerability did not appear to be influenced by the serostatus of the participants at baseline zikvspecific neutralizing antibodies were measured by plaque reduction neutralization test prnt50 and microneutralization mn all dose levels of mrna1893 induced a strong neutralizing zikvspecific antibody response in baseline flavivirus seronegative participants gmts postdose two were comparable to those in a small panel of zika convalescent sera collected during the epidemic in participants with preexisting flavivirus antibodies neutralizing antibody titers were boosted with a single dose of the vaccine as shown by the gmts and the seroconversion rates the participants will continue to be followed through 12 months to measure antibody persistence with time and to monitor safety 

hiv vaccine program mrna1644  mrna1574 

we are advancing two development candidates against hiv – phase 1 innovation is needed to accelerate human validation of novel strategies 

mrna1644 a collaboration with the iavi and the bill and melinda gates foundation is a novel strategy and approach to vaccination against human immunodeficiency virus hiv in humans designed to elicit broadly neutralizing hiv1 antibodies bnabs a phase 1 study for mrna1644 will be the first trial in a series of human studies to iteratively test and improve hiv vaccine antigens that elicit bnabs using a germlinetargeting and immunofocusing a second trial mrna1574 is being evaluated in collaboration with nih and includes multiple nativelike trimer antigens 

we expect to begin phase 1 clinical trials for both mrna1644 and mrna1574 in 2021 these programs have the potential to inform the future of the hiv vaccine field and provide an opportunity for our mrna technology to play a key role in accelerating the discovery of a protective hiv vaccine 

hiv vaccine program mrna1644  mrna1574 disease overview

nipah vaccine mrna1215 

we are collaborating with the nihvrc for pandemic preparedness 

mrna1215 our vaccine candidate against the nipah virus niv was codeveloped along with the nihvrc the phase 1 clinical testing will be focused on pandemic preparedness 

nipah vaccine mrna1215 disease overview

h7n9 influenza vaccine mrna1851 

h7n9 investigational vaccine demonstrates the potential of our platform to respond to an influenza pandemic 

as a proof of concept and as part of our earlier efforts to develop a vaccine against influenza we developed vaccines for h10n8 and h7n9 avian influenza strains where there is a quantitative correlate for protection in humans hemagglutinin inhibition or hai titer of  140 the results of the phase 1 trial for h7n9 vaccine were reported by us in vaccine in 2019 the trial has met its objectives of assessing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1851 versus placebo including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for h7n9 vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed 96 of the subjects demonstrating hai titers  140 at day 43 21 days postsecond vaccination for the 25 µg dose where hai  140 is regarded as a quantitative measure for protection from influenza we believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding however we do not intend to progress the h7n9 vaccine through clinical development on our own 

systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality 

we designed our systemic secreted therapeutics modality to increase levels of desired secreted proteins in circulation or in contact with the extracellular environment in order to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide secreted proteins such as antibodies or enzyme replacement therapies across a wide range of diseases such as heart failure infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases this modality has benefited from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca darpa and the bill and melinda gates foundation we have accumulated several innovations in technology have gained process insights and have built a set of preclinical and clinical experiences in our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality based on these we believe this modality is core to our portfolio and we have expanded this portfolio with two new development candidates in a new autoimmune therapeutic area in 2020 our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality has four development candidates 

systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics opportunity 

the ability to systemically deliver mrna for a therapeutic effect would allow us to address a number of diseases of high unmet medical need systemically delivered secreted and cell surface therapeutics address conditions often treated with recombinant proteins that are typically administered to the blood stream these current therapies include for example 

• enzyme replacement therapies or erts for rare diseases 

• antibodies for membrane and extracellular soluble targets and 

• circulating modulation factors for common and rare diseases such as growth factors and insulin 

systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics product features 

systemically delivered secreted and cell surface therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins our potential advantages in these areas include 

• mrna can produce hardtomake or complex secreted proteins  some proteins due to their folding requirements or complexity are challenging to make using recombinant technologies but can potentially be produced by human cells using administered mrna 

• mrna can produce membrane associated proteins in contrast to recombinant proteins mrna can lead to the production of membrane associated proteins on the cell surface allowing the expression of native forms of signaling receptors or other cell surface complexes 

• native posttranslational modifications are possible through intracellular protein production using mrna mrna administered to a human cell uses natural secretory pathways inside the cell to make and process the encoded protein the resulting posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation are human with recombinant proteins these posttranslational modifications are native to the nonhuman cells used for manufacture these nonhuman posttranslational modifications in recombinant proteins may lead to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes side effects and increased immunogenicity 

• mrna can sustain production of proteins which can increase exposure to proteins with short halflives mrna can lead to protein production by cells that can last from hours to days depending on design this feature could increase the levels of short halflife proteins for therapeutic benefit 

• mrna allows for desirable pharmacology in rare genetic diseases currently addressed by enzyme replacement therapies our mrna technology potentially permits several differentiated pharmacologic features for treating rare genetic diseases currently addressed by enzyme replacement therapies including the ability to repeat dose as needed lower immunogenicity of the replacement protein the ability to adjust dose levels in realtime based on individual patient needs and the ability to stop dosing gene therapies may also prove to be useful for treating rare genetic diseases however mrna is not limited by preexisting immunity that may exist for certain gene therapies using viral vectors and does not localize to the nucleus or require persistent changes to cellular dna to have the desired effect 

our approach 

our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality comprises programs where mrnas instruct various cells of the human body to secrete proteins for therapeutic effect for systemic therapeutic programs that utilize cells in the liver the liver is a highly productive tissue for secreted protein production the human liver can make tens of grams of proteins per day well above the amounts necessary for the pharmacologic effect for virtually all protein therapeutics we have demonstrated that mrna can make and secrete monoclonal antibodies and soluble modulating factors in nonhuman primates these proteins made in nonhuman primates can exert their pharmacological activity by binding to targets with biological effect recombinant protein therapeutics which focus on secreted proteins generate over 200 billion in annual worldwide sales 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 

systemic mrna administration to instruct cells to secrete antibodies in this case for passive immunization to prevent chikungunya infection 

we are using this program to help understand how mrna can be used to make complex secreted proteins in the human body and to address the potential health threat of chikungunya virus particularly for the military and others exposed to this virus this program highlights a potentially important advancement of our platform and expansion of our modalities 

chikungunya is a serious health problem and is estimated to have caused at least 3 million cases during the 20052015 epidemic there are no available vaccines or prophylactic treatments for this disease this virus can cause severe and chronic arthriticlike conditions in up to 50 of infected people this program offers a passive immunization approach using antibodies to prevent infection to complement our vaccine approach in this program we utilize two mrnas encoding for light chain and heavy chain of an antibody against the envelope glycoprotein e we administered these mrnas encapsulated in our proprietary lnps intravenously to people to prevent infection by the chikungunya virus we are being financially supported for specific activities by darpa 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 disease overview 

addressing a significant global health need 

chikungunya virus is a mosquitoborne alphavirus posing a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions while chikungunya has been present in africa for centuries recent outbreaks and epidemics in new regions have arisen due to the expanding distribution of the aedes mosquito in which it resides a chikungunya epidemic beginning in 2004 in kenya spread to india and was exported to nearly all regions of the world and brought chikungunya to the attention of the western world as of april 2016 chikungunya cases had been reported in 103 countries and territories around the world including 46 countries and territories throughout the americas chikungunya virus infection is characterized by an acute onset of fever rash myalgia and sometimes debilitating polyarthralgia giving the virus its name which means “that which bends up” when translated from makonde while generally nonfatal neurological sequelae such as guillainbarre syndrome and chronic arthritis have been recognized 

chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of the togaviridae family with a positivestrand rna genome the viral structural proteins are naturally expressed as a single polyprotein followed by subsequent cleavage by viral and cellular proteases into capsid c and envelope e glycoproteins e3 e2 6k and e1 the e proteins are major targets of protective neutralizing antibody responses that can be assessed in assays in animal models passive immunotherapy with convalescent sera from chikungunya infected patients and human chikungunya virusspecific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies that mainly recognize e2 have been shown to prevent chkv infection providing an approach for therapy 

there are currently no effective therapies or approved vaccines to treat or prevent chikungunya infection or disease and effective mosquito control has proven challenging even in higher income countries currently infected individuals are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to relieve some symptoms therefore in addition to an effective prophylactic vaccine we believe there is a need for systemic secreted antibody with the potential to provide passive immunity both prophylactically in susceptible populations and for treatment of active chikungunya virus infections 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 our product concept 

a systemically delivered mrna instructing cells to secrete an antibody to glycoprotein e to neutralize chikungunya 

the mrna1944 development candidate contains two mrnas that encode the heavy and light chains of the chikungunya antibody and utilizes our proprietary lnps the mrna1944 development candidate encodes a fully human igg antibody isolated from b cells of a patient with a prior history of chikungunya infection that targets the e2 protein the systemic antibody against chikungunya virus titers can be evaluated in clinical trials by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or elisa to quantify the amount of expressed igg a neutralization assay can be used to ensure that the mrna expressed antibody was properly folded and functional 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 preclinical information 

systemic mrna administration results in antibody production and protection from chikungunya infection in animals 

in preclinical studies mrna1944 administered by infusion elicited high levels of neutralizing antibodies in a dosedependent manner that were protective against arthritis musculoskeletal tissue infection and lethal challenge in mouse models after treatment with 05 mgkg of mrna1944 complete survival of mice was observed when challenged 24 hours postprophylaxis with chikungunya virus in cynomolgus macaques following infusion of a singledose of mrna1944 at 05 mgkg mean maximum concentrations of human chikungunya antibodies 101359 µgml were reached at 24 hours that exceeded the levels needed for protection in mice with a halflife of 23 day 

in addition mrna1944 was tested in rats and nonhuman primates in a repeatdose study via iv infusion at up to 5 and 3 mgkg respectively no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna1944 were observed and all other observations were generally reversible 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 clinical data 

twodose regimen of chikungunya antibody demonstrates the platform’s ability for safe repeat doing 

we are conducting a phase 1 randomized placebocontrolled doseescalation study of mrna1944 in healthy adults the objective of this firstinhuman study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating single doses of mrna1944 at 01 and 03 mgkg and 06 mgkg with and without dexamethasone included in the premedication regimen with 8 subjects per cohort and 2 weekly doses of 03 mgkg administered via intravenous infusion no further dose escalation beyond 06 mgkg is planned other objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics of all dose levels of mrna1944 to determine if the antibodies produced are sufficiently active to neutralize viral infection in assays and to determine the pharmacodynamics of antichikungunya virus igg levels the safety monitoring committee or smc reviews the safety data for the dose level and recommends escalation to the next dose level 

in september 2019 we announced that single doses of mrna1944 at 01 03 and 06 mgkg resulted in levels of antibody that exceeded those expected to be protective against chikungunya infection 1 μgml and the 03 mgkg and 06 mgkg doses were projected to maintain antibody levels above protective levels for at least 16 weeks as shown in the panel below the average serum antibody level was quantified at various time points to demonstrate a halflife of 62 days no significant adverse events were observed at the low and middle doses infusionrelated adverse events were observed at the high dose which resolved spontaneously without treatment 

in september 2020 we announced positive interim data from the phase 1 study evaluating escalating doses of mrna1944 at 01 03 and 06 mgkg dose with and without steroid premedication and two doses of 03 mgkg given one week apart administration of mrna1944 at all doses resulted in dosedependent increases in levels of antibody against chikungunya virus with a mean halflife of 69 days postsingle doses of 03 and 06 mgkg therapeuticallyrelevant concentrations of antibody 1 µgml were observed for 16 weeks neutralizing antibodies were observed at all dose levels indicating functional antibody production by mrna1944 across doses of mrna1944 adverse effects were mildtomoderate in severity and transient and none were serious the most common adverse events were headache na usea myalgia dizziness and chills following a second dose of mrna1944 at the 03 mgkg level a 18fold increase in the concentration of chikungunya virus was observed with no worsening or exacerbation of side effects and no significant accumulation of mrna lnp components or acute phase reactants 

the phase 1 trial is ongoing in followup period during 2021 

phase 1 interim analysis with twodose regimen 

relaxin mrna0184 summary 

we have regained rights to develop relaxin from astrazeneca and are evaluating the program 

until december 2020 we collaborated with astrazeneca on mrna encoding for a relaxin protein designed for a long duration of action relaxin is a wellstudied natural protein hormone that is known to have cardiovascular protective effects earlier attempts at developing relaxin as a protein therapeutic have not been successful we believe that engineering the relaxin protein for a longer duration utilizing repeat dosing and pursuing an alternate indication might overcome the shortcomings of earlier attempts we use mrna encoding for an engineered relaxin protein designed for a longer duration of action it is also designed to be produced by the body with human posttranslational modifications 

in december 2020 we regained the rights to the relaxin program from astrazeneca previously azd7970 we are currently evaluating our options for advancing the program 

autoimmune therapeutic area mrn a6981 and mrna6231 introduction 

our company strategy continues to be to invest in our platform technology and scalable infrastructure to pursue a pipeline of potential medicines that reflect the breadth of the mrna opportunity in january 2020 we announced the entry into a fifth therapeutic area autoimmune diseases building on the clinical validation of the systemic delivery of mrna provided by the phase 1 clinical proof of concept of the chikungunya antibody program autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune activation in response to antigens normally present in the body reflecting a loss of tolerance within this therapeutic area we are developing two potential medicines mrna6981 and mrna6231 designed to engage peripheral tolerance pathways to dampen autoimmune activation and help restore immune homeostasis thereby reducing autoimmune pathology in this modality mrna is delivered systemically to create proteins that are either secreted or expressed on the cell surface 

our approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases is to leverage mechanisms of peripheral tolerance to modulate the immune system’s reaction to selfantigens 

scientific and technical advances enable our expansion into new therapeutic areas the latest of which is autoimmune disease autoimmune diseases are defined by pathology resulting from an adaptive immune response against an antigen or antigens normally present within the body pathology is present in a variety of organs across autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus inflammatory bowel disease psoriasis type 1 diabetes multiple sclerosis autoimmune hepatitis and related disorders such as graft vs host disease autoimmune diseases affect millions of patients worldwide many of whose disease is not wellcontrolled by existing treatment options and represent billions of dollars in healthcare costs 

in healthy people autoimmune reactions are prevented or controlled by mechanisms of tolerance lymphocytes eg t and b cells that are reactive against selfantigens are deleted during development thus establishing central tolerance central tolerance is not completely protective and so other mechanisms collectively known as peripheral tolerance act on any selfreactive lymphocytes that escape central tolerance to control potential autoimmune pathology these mechanisms of peripheral tolerance include induction of a reversible state of cellular nonresponsiveness in selfreactive cells called anergy and expression of inhibitory receptors or cytokines by other cells such as dendritic cells macrophages and regulatory t cells tregs the immune system works constantly to maintain balance between a state of immune activation and immune tolerance sometimes called homeostasis we are developing two potential medicines we believe have the potential to engage peripheral tolerance mechanisms to dampen autoimmune activation and help restore immune homeostasis pdl1 mrna6981 aims to induce the expression of this inhibitory receptor on myeloid cells and il2 mrna6231 aims to preferentially increase the number of tregs 

pdl1 mrna6981 

pdl1 is a coinhibitory receptor that can induce anergy in programmed cell death protein 1 pd1expressing t cells 

antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells form stable cellcell junctions with t and b cells called immune synapses to communicate in three ways signal 1 antigen presentation and recognition signal 2 costimulatory signals to activate the cell and signal 3 cytokines chemokines and certain metabolites to activate repress or modulate the immune response when immune synapses occur in the context of high levels of coinhibition such as high levels of pdl1 expressed on antigen presenting cells this may result in the induction of peripheral regulatory t cells induction of a reversible nonresponsive state called anergy or death of autoreactive lymphocytes due to removal of critical survival signals given their role in adaptive immune responses and their involvement in autoimmune disorders dendritic cells and other myeloid populations have become a target of recent immunotherapies 

the pdl1pd1 pathway has a critical function in immune regulation and promotes development and function of tregs pdl1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages activated t cells b cells and monocytes as well as peripheral tissues its cognate receptor pd1 is a coinhibitory transmembrane protein expressed on t cells b cells natural killer cells and thymocytes engagement of pd1 to pdl1 results in decreased il2 production and glucose metabolism with continued engagement leading to induction of t cell anergy or conversion of naïve cells into peripheral regulatory t cells engagement of pdl1 with pd1 also inhibits t cell proliferation cytotoxic activity and cytokine production and suppresses the reactivation of previously activated t effector cells 

preclinical mouse models deficient in pd1 spontaneously develop a variety of autoimmune diseases such as arthritis myocarditis lupuslike glomerulonephritis and type 1 diabetes demonstrating the critical role of the pdl1pd1 interaction in maintaining tolerance to selfantigens additionally treatment of cancer patients with pd1 or pdl1 inhibitors sometimes results in immunerelated adverse events including the development of hepatitis dermatitis and colitis demonstrating the role of pd1pdl1 in human autoimmune reactions 

we believe our pdl1 therapy may augment pdl1 expression on cell types similar to those that endogenously express it and by reducing immune activation potentially reduce the clinical manifestations of a variety of autoimmune diseases 

pdl1 mrna6981 our product concept 

we intend to induce expression of pdl1 on myeloid cells to send a tolerizing signal to immune cells in their environment in order to treat autoimmune diseases 

our intent is to use our platform to influence myeloid cells including dendritic cells to provide additional coinhibitory signals by augmenting endogenous expression of pdl1 we believe that this tolerizing signal to lymphocytes may limit autoreactivity in the context of ongoing autoimmune pathology without severe and global suppression of the immune system given that our platform allows us to modify myeloid cells in situ  our approach to the creation of a tolerogenic environment may provide unique benefits in treating autoimmune diseases by seeking to restore immune homeostasis we believe the platform technologies used have already been substantially validated in humans mrna6981 employs the same delivery technology used in clinical trials for our chikungunya antibody therapeutic mrna1944 results with mrna1944 demonstrate predictable dosedependent pharmacology that translated effectively from preclinical species into humans 

pdl1 mrna6981 preclinical information 

we have observed disease modification in a range of preclinical models 

we have investigated the effect of mrna6981 in multiple disease models in one example we evaluated mrna6981 in a rat model of arthritis animals were given a single injection of chicken collagen type ii in incomplete freund’s adjuvant in order to induce chronic arthritislike symptoms mrna6981 was dosed subcutaneously at four times per week and compared to a negative pbs control and a positive control of daily high dose dexamethasone dex arthritislike symptoms included paw swelling and joint rigidity which were scored as a proxy for disease severity compared to animals treated with pbs animals treated with pdl1 mrna presented with consistently less severe disease similar to animals treated daily with dexamethasone for at least three weeks 

collageninduced arthritis model 

we have investigated mrna6981 in a range of other preclinical models of autoimmune and related diseases including type 1 diabetes colitis and graftversushost disease and observed diseasemodifying activity 

pdl1 mrna6981 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial for patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis aih 

aih is an autoimmune condition involving inflammation in the liver which over time can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure type 1 aih is characterized by a specific autoantibody profile and afflicts more than 75000 patients in the us type 1 aih is typically treated with steroids and azathioprine but some patients either do not respond to these treatments or are unable to tolerate them and are therefore in need of alternatives a specific role for pdl1 therapy in treating type 1 aih is supported by clinical observations in cancer patients receiving pd1pdl1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment a noted adverse event is the development of aih which responds to discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy and treatment with corticosteroids checkpoint inhibitorinduced aih has an identical histological and clinical manifestation compared to nondrug induced type 1 aih we believe that mrna6981 may provide benefit to type 1 aih patients by increasing pdl1 expression and plan to pursue proofofconcept in type 1 aih as a first step to addressing a range of autoimmune indications we are planning a clinical trial to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacology and duration of the effect of mrna6981 in type 1 aih patients refractory or intolerant to the standard of care 

il2 mutein mrna6231 

il2 is a critical cytokine for treg activation and expansion 

cytokines are potent modulators of the immune system directing function and homeostasis il2 is critically important to t cell survival and function il2 acts through a receptor complex that can be dimeric il2rß cd122 plus the common γ chain cd132 or trimeric which is formed through the addition of il2rα cd25 to the dimeric form the trimeric form has 10fold to 100fold greater affinity for il2 under low or homeostatic il2 conditions those cells which preferentially express the trimeric receptor or il2r such as tregs and very recently activated effector t cells are activated conversely those cells that express the dimeric form such as naïve or antigenexperienced cytotoxic t cells and natural killer cells nk cells are only activated by much higher concentrations of il2 tregs play an obligate role in maintaining peripheral tolerance through the control of effector t cell responses and several strategies are being developed to exploit il2 to treat autoimmune disease by selectively enhancing treg function these include recombinant protein forms of il2mab complexes il2 muteins and lowdose il2 

il2 mutein mrna6231 our product concept 

we intend to utilize subcutaneous mrna administration to produce a version of il2 that is potentially longer acting and more selective for the trimeric il2 receptor il2r in order to treat autoimmune diseases 

il2based therapeutics are being clinically evaluated for a wide range of immunemediated disorders including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus graft versus host disease inflammatory bowel diseases and autoimmune hepatitis we believe that our platform can be exploited to produce a modified il2 for the treatment of autoimmune conditions our modified il2 is engineered with mutations that selectively decrease binding to the dimeric il2 receptor present on cd4 and cd8 t effector cells and nk cells and increase reliance upon cd25 of the trimeric il2 receptor complex to trigger the signaling cascade in regulatory t cells our modified il2 is also expressed as a fusion protein to extend its halflife in the serum this will be the first demonstration of subcutaneous administration of the delivery technology that is also used in clinical trials for our chikungunya antibody therapeutic mrna1944 

il2 mutein mrna6231 preclinical information 

we have observed preferential expansion of tregs in nonhuman primates 

preclinical studies have been conducted using mouse homologs as well as cynomolgus monkeys in one example monkeys were dosed subcutaneously with a single dose of mrna6231 and t cells in the peripheral blood were monitored on days 1 3 5 8 and 14 the percentage of tregs cd4 t cells that were also foxp3 increased about 12fold average across n4 animals at their maximum day 8 postdosing conversely the percentage of activated cd8 conventional t cells that coexpress cd25 did not significantly increase over baseline at any time during the monitoring period illustrating the preferential expansion of tregs by the il2 mutein 

il2 mutein mrna6231 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers to assess safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 

we plan to conduct a phase 1 dose escalation study of mrna6231 in adult healthy volunteers the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna6231 to assess the pharmacodynamic response through treg selective expansion activation and duration and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of mrna6231 in expressing il2 in the serum following subcutaneous administration 

cancer vaccines modality 

we designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens defined below this modality has two programs currently for neoantigen vaccines a personalized cancer vaccine or pcv program and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called kras both conducted in collaboration with merck the goal of a cancer vaccine is to safely expose the patient’s immune system to tumor related antigens known as neoantigens to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique to a patient as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program 

disease overview 

more than 18 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2020 according to the nih despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from checkpoint inhibitors as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available therapies in addition treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms principally the local immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells which prevent either access to or recognition by t cells 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor t cell therapies have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens 

cancer vaccines product features 

we believe that mrna technology is an attractive approach for cancer vaccines for many reasons including 

• mrna vaccines can deliver multiple neoantigens concatenated in a single mrna molecule  we currently encode up to 34 neoantigens in one of our personalized cancer vaccines mrna4157 and four kras mutations in our kras vaccine mrna5671 given that a t cell response against a single antigen has the potential to eradicate cancer cells we believe that delivering multiple neoantigens could increase the probability of a successful treatment outcome for a patient 

• mrna encoding for neoantigens is translated and processed by patients’ endogenous cellular mechanisms for presentation to the immune system  neoantigen peptides are then potentially processed in multiple ways to give rise to different smaller peptides for presentation by the immune system we believe this endogenous antigen production and presentation has the potential to drive a more effective immune response 

• mrna vaccines can be efficiently personalized the shared features of mrna combined with our investments in automated manufacturing technology enable us to manufacture individual cgmp batches of personalized cancer vaccines rapidly in parallel for example we have demonstrated the ability to manufacture and release a “customdesigned” vaccine for an individual patient within 60 days of sequencing the patient’s tumor for the personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 

personalized cancer vaccines pcv mrna4157  

our personalized cancer vaccine or pcv is currently being evaluated in a phase 1 and a phase 2 study the phase 1 trial is assessing mrna4157 alone and in combination with keytruda® the phase 2 trial is assessing the mrna4157 in combination with keytruda vs keytruda alone keytruda is a registered trademark of merck sharp  dohme corp 

pcv mrna4157 our product concept 

as tumors grow they acquire mutations some of which create new protein sequences or neoantigens that can be presented on hla molecules in the tumor and recognized as nonself by t cells these neoantigens can be shared as in mrna5671 or are completely unique to an individual patient’s tumor in addition to the neoantigens being unique and patient specific the presentation of those neoantigens is also dependent on a patient’s specific hla type identification of patientspecific hla type and tumor neoantigens through next generation sequencing paired with our proprietary in silico design of each patient’s mrna 

vaccine and rapid manufacturing for a specific patient allows us to rapidly deliver a completely unique and personalized medicine to patients 

our personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 consists of an mrna that encodes up to 34 neoantigens predicted to elicit both class i cd8 and class ii cd4 responses designed against each individual patient’s tumor mutations and specific to their hla type the neoantigens are encoded in a single mrna sequence and formulated in our proprietary lnps designed for intramuscular injection the mrna sequence is then manufactured using an automated workflow to enable a rapid turnaround time 

pcv mrna4157 clinical data 

the phase 1 trial is an openlabel multicenter study to assess the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna4157 alone in subjects with resected solid tumors and in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab marketed in the united states as keytruda in subjects with resected and unresected solid tumors mrna4157 is administered on the first day of each 21day cycle for a maximum of nine doses mrna4157 is administered as monotherapy part a or in combination with pembrolizumab parts b c and d in the united states studies have shown mrna4157 to be well tolerated at all dose levels the majority of adverse events from mrna4157 have been low grade and reversible encouraging data emerging from an expansion arm in patients with head and neck cancer has recently caused us to increase the size of that cohort which continues to recruit trial participants 

the randomized phase 2 trial will assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab improves relapsefree survival compared to pembrolizumab alone 

kras vaccine mrna5671 

finding oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell epitopes has considerable therapeutic implications point mutations in the kras gene occur in about 22 of human cancers such as colorectal nonsmall cell lung and pancreatic cancers it has been reported that krasmutant neoantigens can be presented on certain human hlas we have designed an mrna to generate and present kras neoantigens to the immune system from the four most common kras mutations the phase 1 trial is being conducted by merck and is currently ongoing in the united states 

kras vaccine mrna5671 our product concept 

oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell neoantigens have considerable potential therapeutic implications 1 driver mutations are subject to positive selection as they confer survival advantages for the tumor and 2 such neoantigens could be shared between patients enabling an easier approach to developing and manufacturing such therapeutic or curative interventions 

kras is a frequently mutated oncogene in epithelial cancers primarily lung colorectal cancer or crc and pancreatic cancers the four most prevalent kras mutations associated with these malignancies are g12d g12v g13d and g12c which constitute 80 to 90 of kras mutations 

kras vaccine mrna5671 clinical plan 

merck is conducting an openlabel multicenter doseescalation and dose expansion phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna5671 administered as an intramuscular injection both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab 

intratumoral immunooncology modality 

we designed our intratumoral immunooncology modality to treat or cure cancer by transforming the tumor microenvironment to drive anticancer t cell responses against tumors our mrna technology within this modality allows for the combination of multiple therapeutics that can be directly injected into a tumor with the goal of activating immune cells to kill cancer cells in the injected tumor as well as in distal tumors known as the abscopal effect intratumoral administration allows for localized effect of these therapeutics that could be toxic if administered systemically this exploratory modality has three development candidates 

disease overview 

as noted above more than 18 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2020 according to the nih there have been several advances in the treatment of cancer through immunemediated therapies in recent years however the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer remains poor especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement and are sometimes termed immunologically “cold” we aim to activate the tumor microenvironment with our mrna therapeutic candidates in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors 

intratumoral immunooncology our approach 

we believe our approach to immunooncology using mrna medicines could complement checkpoint inhibitors and has several advantages over recombinant proteinbased drugs including 

• mrna focuses and limits exposure of immune stimulatory proteins one of the intrinsic properties of mrna is its transient nature this allows for short exposure of the proteins encoded by the mrna in the target tissue thereby potentially enhancing tolerability 

• mrna can produce membrane associated immune stimulatory proteins in contrast to recombinant proteins mrna administered to a tumor site can lead to the production of either secreted or membrane proteins depending on the mrna sequence 

• multiplexing of mrna allows access to multiple immune stimulatory pathways  the ability to combine multiple mrnas to express multiple proteins allows for activation of several immune pathways simultaneously for example ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 encodes for two secreted cytokines il23 and il36γ and one membrane protein ox40l 

• mrna sequences can be engineered to reduce offtarget effects mrna sequences can be designed to minimize translation in offtarget tissues for immunestimulatory proteins this can potentially prevent toxicities 

• local administration of mrna can create a concentration gradient for encoded proteins  mrna administered intratumorally allows for the local production of encoded immunestimulatory proteins such as cytokines the mrna and encoded protein are expected to form a concentration gradient that decreases as a function of the distance from the tumor thereby potentially lowering undesirable systemic effects and increasing immunestimulatory effects close to the tumor 

ox40l mrna2416 

there have been several recent advances in the treatment of cancer through activation of the immune system however many patients with advanced stages of cancer respond to few therapies and continue to face a poor outlook alternative strategies to activate an immunologic antitumor response while at the same time reducing systemic toxicities are required to this end we have developed an investigational mrna therapeutic coding for wildtype ox40 ligand or ox40l protein a membrane protein normally expressed on antigen presenting cells upon immune stimulation that augments an activated immune response mrna2416 encodes for wildtype ox40l which is a membrane protein a class of proteins that we believe cannot be manufactured for administration to tumor cells by recombinant technologies mrna2416 is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors following local intratumoral injection we are currently sponsoring a phase 12 trial that is ongoing in the united states which includes phase 1 dose escalation cohorts of mrna2416 as monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab followed by a phase 2 expansion cohort in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma in combination with durvalumab 

ox40l mrna2416 our product concept 

our product consists of mrna coding for the human sequence of ox40l formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna2416 was designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of a microrna binding site thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability following intratumoral injection a specific antitumor immune response is expected to be induced via proliferation and migration of t cell clones with specificity for the cancer that may also result in systemic antitumor responses 

ox40l mrna2416 clinical data 

the phase 12 trial for mrna2416 is an openlabel multicenter study of repeated intratumoral injections of mrna2416 as a monotherapy and in combination with durvalumab in patients with advanced relapsedrefractory solid tumor malignancies and lymphomas in the united states and israel the objectives of this phase 12 study include evaluating safety and tolerability of mrna2416 administered intratumorally and to define the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion alone and in combination with durvalumab other endpoints include pharmacokinetic analyses as well as assessment of biomarkers of immunological response in tumor the dose levels being tested in the monotherapy arm of the trial were 1 µg 2 µg 4 µg and 8 µg the monotherapy arm of the study has been completed and we are not planning an expansion cohort of mrna2416 as a monotherapy we have completed a dosefinding cohort at 4 µg mrna2416 given in combination with durvalumab imfinzi® and are currently enrolling a phase 2 expansion cohort in ovarian cancer 

as of january 1 2021 60 patients were dosed with mrna2416 39 patients in monotherapy and 21 patients in combination with durvalumab as of february 12 2020 safety was reported on 39 patients treated with monotherapy mrna2416 mrna2416 has been tolerable at all dose levels with no doselimiting toxicities reported and the majority of treatment related adverse events being grade 1 or 2 we have observed systemic injection related reactions in seven patients all of which have been reversible 

of the evaluable cases for patients dosed with mrna2416 as of november 13 2019 14 achieved a best overall response rate bor of stable disease of these patients 6 had stable disease for ≥14 weeks 15 patients had progressive disease per recist 11 clinical observations include a reduction in injected tumor size in two patients with ovarian cancer one patient with breast cancer and one patient with pseudomyxoma peritonei 

ox40lil23il36 γ triplet mrna2752 clinical update 

despite recent advances in immunemediated therapies for cancer the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer is poor we are developing triplet mrna2752 and other programs to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming cold tumor microenvironments into productive “hotter” immune landscapes with local intratumoral therapies triplet mrna2752 utilizes the intrinsic advantage of mrna to multiplex and to produce membrane and secreted proteins with mrna in a single investigational medicine triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding human ox40l interleukin 23 or il23 and interleukin 36 gamma or il36γ that are encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and administered intratumorally ox40l is a membrane protein whereas il23 and il36γ are secreted cytokines we believe our approach has the advantage of localized high concentration gradients of il23 and il36γ compared to recombinant proteins administered systemically or intratumorally additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which we believe recombinant protein technologies cannot enable the combination of ox40l il23 and il36γ has shown robust activity in preclinical cancer models and is synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors in addition this combination elicits an antitumor response on distal tumors via the “abscopal effect” as well as treated tumors in preclinical studies a phase 1 trial of triplet mrna2752 is ongoing 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 our product concept 

we are developing triplet mrna2752 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma as a single agent or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding ox40l il23 and il36γ encapsulated in our proprietary lnp triplet mrna2752 is designed to make these proteins in cells of the local tumor environment or lymph node our approach potentially has the advantage of localized gradients of two important cytokines il23 and il36γ rather than a systemic administration or intratumoral injection of cytokine proteins that would lead to quick diffusion away from the tumor additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which would be challenging to administer to either a tumor or systemically as a recombinant membrane protein capable of costimulation of t cells mrna for il23 produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il23a subunits with a linker between the subunits mrna for il36γ produces a protein with introduced signal peptide to bypass a need for upstream processing for release and activity in addition all three mrna were designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of microrna binding sites thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 clinical update 

we have an ongoing phase 1 study that is designed as an openlabel multicenter study of intratumoral injections of triplet mrna2752 alone or in combination with durvalumab antipdl1 with sites in the united states and israel the objectives of this study include 

• assessment of safety and tolerability of triplet mrna2752 administered alone and in combination with durvalumab 

• define the maximum tolerated dose or mtd and recommended dose for expansion or rde for intratumoral injections of triplet mrna2752 alone and in combination with durvalumab and 

• assessment of antitumor activity protein expression in tumors and pharmacokinetics and exploratory endpoints that include assessment of immunological responses 

the study consists of two arms arm a triplet monotherapy and arm b triplet in combination with durvalumab there are dose escalation and dose confirmation parts for each study arm followed by a dose expansions for arm b mrna2752 will be evaluated at 025 05 1 2 4 and 8 µg mrna2752 is administered once every two weeks for cycle 1 followed by once every four weeks for cycles 2 through 6 durvalumab is administered every four weeks biopsy and blood samples to be collected pre and posttreatment with mrna in both dose escalation and dose expansion to assess protein expression and changes in tumor immune landscape 

as of january 1 2021 44 patients have been dosed with mrna2752 including 19 patients in monotherapy and 25 patients in combination with durvalumab safety in this study was reported as of april 8 2020 on 29 cases including 17 patients treated with mrna2752 monotherapy and 12 patients in combination with durvalumab across dose levels tested study treatment has been well tolerated with no doselimiting toxicities one patient with grade 3 toxicity at 4 µg dose level and no grade 45 toxicities related to treatment one partial response with an 81 decrease in target lesions has been observed in a squamous cell bladder cancer patient on the combination arm stable disease has been observed in nine patients five on mrna2752 monotherapy and four treated with durvalumab combination tumor shrinkage was observed in seven patients in injected andor uninjected target lesions three on monotherapy and four on combination 

as of april 8 2020 biomarker data from the first eight cohorts monotherapy at dose levels between 025 µg– 4 µg combination at 025 µg and 05 µg demonstrated increased il23 and il36g protein expression evidence of a proinflammatory effect of treatment including elevated interferon gamma tumor necrosis factor alpha and pdl1 data consistent with demonstration of proof of mechanism all posttreatment plasma cytokine levels evaluated were well below what has been suggested as clinically toxic levels for these cytokines in cytokine release syndromes significant increases in pdl1 protein levels predominantly in immune cells in the tumor microenvironment were observed at days 2 15 and 29 posttreatment demonstrating the sustained immunomodulatory effect of treatment in the patient with the partial response increased t cells particularly of proliferating cd8 cytotoxic t cells were observed post treatment 

il12 medi1191 

another strategy for cancer patients with immunologically cold tumors is to transform the tumor microenvironment by introducing proinflammatory cytokines directly into tumors or draining lymph nodes in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing medi1191 which is an mrna for il12 encapsulated in our proprietary lnp to be delivered intratumorally systemic administration of recombinant il12 protein was poorly tolerated in early clinical trials and exhibited generally low response rates medi1191 can enhance the immune response by positively impacting both antigen presenting cells and t cells and local intratumoral expression of il12 can potentially improve tolerability compared to systemic protein treatments astrazeneca is conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for medi1191 which is to be coadministered with a checkpoint inhibitor 

il12 medi1191 our product concept 

intratumoral delivery of il12 has been observed to be a feasible approach to overcome the toxicity associated with systemic il12 administration for example intratumoral delivery of an il12 containing dna plasmid by injection followed by electroporation has shown promising activity in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with metastatic melanoma such an approach may be limited to accessible lesions amenable to electroporation in contrast it may be more feasible to inject our mrna delivered by our proprietary lnp into both accessible and visceral tumors 

medi1191 is being developed for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor medi1191 consists of our proprietary lnp encapsulating an mrna for human il12b p40 and il12a p35 subunits the mrna produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il12a subunits with a linker between the subunits the mrna sequence has been engineered to enhance protein production and is designed to decrease the amount of protein that might be made in hepatocytes for better tolerability 

il12 medi1191 preclinical information 

we have conducted several preclinical studies in which we observed activity with our approach 

our preclinical studies were conducted with a mouse homolog of il12 in a tumor model that we have characterized as completely refractory to checkpoint therapy and associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment treatment with il12 transformed the tumor microenvironment with notable activation of natural killer and dendritic cells and an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes in this checkpoint inhibitor refractory mouse model of cancer a single dose of il12 mrna yielded around 30 complete response rates as an mrna monotherapy as shown in panel a below and was synergistically active with systemically administered antipdl1 antibody or α pdl1 demonstrating complete response rates of  70 as shown in panel b of the figure below the xaxis represents days after subcutaneous implantation of mc38r tumor cells test articles were administered on day 11 for mrna treatments and on days 11 14 18 and 21 for antibody treatments all antibody treatments were administered at 20 mgkg there were 15 mice per group in this study survival curves were plotted by considering any reason a mouse was removed from study including the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3  as a survival event ntc is a nontranslating control mrna synergy of locally administered il12 mrna with systemic α pdl1 treatment was also observed on distal tumors that were not directly administered mrna

we are responsible for generating a preclinical data package to support the filing of an ind and clinical trial authorization cta and clinical supply for early clinical development astrazeneca is leading the early clinical development astrazeneca is currently enrolling an openlabel multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral injections of medi1191 alone and in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab 

localized regenerative therapeutics modality 

we designed our localized regenerative therapeutics modality to develop mrna medicines to address injured or diseased tissues our mrna technology in this modality allows for the local production of proteins that provide a therapeutic benefit in the targeted tissue the development of our program in this modality azd8601 for the local production of vegfa is being led by our strategic collaborator astrazeneca this program completed a phase 1ab clinical trial in which we observed both a dosedependent protein production and a pharmacologic effect as measured by changes in local blood flow in patients we believe this data provides clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting 

localized regenerative therapeutics opportunity 

there are multiple applications for tissue regeneration with astrazeneca we have focused on ischemic heart failure for the first program coronary artery disease the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle in 2015 coronary artery disease resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally 

localized regenerative therapeutics product features 

we believe our approach to localized regenerative therapeutics using mrna has several advantages over alternative approaches including 

• mrna can be administered locally to produce the desired protein for an extended duration  local exposure to the therapeutic protein encoded by our mrna is sustained by the ongoing translation of the mrna into protein often from hours to days this pharmacokinetic profile closely mimics the optimal tissue exposure profile for regenerative applications and cannot be achieved by injections of recombinant proteins that rapidly diffuse out of the tissue after injection 

• local administration of mrna allows for focused activity  mrna administered to a specific tissue or organ should allow for local production of the encoded protein which could lead to lower levels of encoded protein in distant or systemic locations this could help to prevent potential toxicity from production of the encoded protein outside of the targeted tissue 

• mrna allows for dosedependent and repeated production of the encoded protein  mrna therapies should also allow for dose titration and repeat dosing this provides several advantages over gene therapy gene therapy typically results in a permanent change to cellular dna that may result in uncontrolled or constant production of the desired protein in local tissue or in distant sites which could cause local or systemic side effects further some gene therapy delivery vehicles are associated with immune responses that limit the ability to repeat dose preventing dose titration 

vegfa azd8601 

addressing ischemic heart failure—vegfa as a localized therapeutic in collaboration with astrazeneca 

heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states accounting for one in every four deaths and is often due to the inability of adults to regenerate heart tissue current approved therapies do not specifically address heart regeneration previous attempts at cardiac regeneration have included stem cell grafting and gene therapy but have faced challenges with safety or efficacy in collaboration with astrazeneca we are pioneering a unique approach to treating ischemic heart failure a condition where the cardiac muscle does not get enough blood supply to perform its contractile function vascular endothelial growth factor a or vegfa can promote cardiac tissue revascularization the goal of this program is to promote recovery of cardiac function through partial tissue regeneration the mrna in this program is in a saline formulation without lnps and is expected to act locally our strategic collaborator astrazeneca has conducted a phase 1ab clinical study in diabetic patients in europe the study has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of dosedependent protein production and changes in blood flow astrazeneca has moved this program to a phase 2a trial that is being conducted in europe and is designed to test safety and tolerability of epicardial injections for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery 

vegfa azd8601 disease overview 

vegfa can promote blood vessel growth to potentially address ischemic heart failure 

several treatments are available for patients with ischemic heart failure current treatments include revascularization of the coronary arteries to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac function and therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate excess fluids in congested tissues including betablockers angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii inhibitors and aldosterone receptor blockers as diuretics however adult humans are unable to regenerate myocardium tissue following injury and the treatment options described above cannot compensate for this 

vegfa is a potent angiogenic factor that promotes growth of blood vessels preclinical data suggests that expression of this growth factor in the ischemic heart could increase blood flow and partially restore cardiac function 

vegfa azd8601 our product concept 

local delivery of vegfa mrna to increase local concentration of vegfa protein while reducing systemic distribution of therapeutic vegfa protein 

vegfa protein acts as a powerful promoter of blood vessel growth systemic injection of vegfa protein increases vegfa exposure throughout the body which can lead to side effects but is very shortlived in circulation therefore any therapy involving vegfa needs to be localized to elevate local protein concentration and drive revascularization while minimizing systemic side effects astrazeneca has opted to pursue the localized application of vegfa mrna in a simple saline formulation in the heart muscle to elevate local protein concentration for longer periods due to increased local protein production this potentially allows for an extended pharmacodynamic effect at the specific site of injection compared to systemic or local administration of a recombinant protein version of vegfa some of the early animal work for mrna vegfa was published by our academic cofounder dr kenneth chien in nature biotechnology in 2013 showing improved cardiac function with increased survival with treatment 

vegfa azd8601 preclinical information 

astrazeneca has observed the activity of vegfa for ischemic heart failure in several preclinical animal models 

preclinical studies have been conducted at astrazeneca in models of ischemic heart failure in mouse rat and pig models of myocardial infarction direct injection in the heart muscle myocardium of vegfa mrna led to elevated cardiac vegfa protein levels and improved cardiac function the data have been published by astrazeneca in molecular therapy in 2018 

vegfa azd8601 clinical data 

astrazeneca has completed a phase 1ab trial in germany a phase 2a trial is currently ongoing in finland and germany 

the phase1ab clinical trial for the azd8601 program has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of protein production and changes in blood flow post azd8601 administration astrazeneca has moved this program to a phase 2a trial 

the phase 1ab study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus conducted in europe vegfa mrna was administered by intradermal injection into the forearm skin in single ascending doses the primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product into the forearm skin with safety followup for six months 

the study was divided into part a single ascendingdose cohorts and part b pharmacodynamic cohort there were three treatment regimens in part a regimens were either azd8601 at site 1 and placebo at site 2 placebo at site 1 and azd8601 at site 2 or placebo at both sites each regimen comprised six 50 µl injections at one site and six 50 µl injections at a second site on the forearm in part b the regimen comprised one 50 µl intradermal injection of either azd8601 or placebo at each of four sites on the forearm 

there were 27 patients in part a with 18 receiving azd8601 in at least one site of the forearm and 9 patients receiving placebo there were three dose cohorts in part a each with 9 patients in the first cohort azd8601 dose was at 24 µg per patient 4 µg per injection the azd8601 dose was increased to 72 µg and 360 µg in the next two dose cohorts there were 15 patients in part b receiving azd8601 in at least two sites on the forearm per patient in part b each patient received 200 µg of azd8601 or placebo 

vegfa protein post injection of mrna was produced at a high level above the set expected threshold as shown in the figure below expression was measured by skin microdialysis at each sampling time mean vegfa protein levels across all mrna treated sites from patients across all cohorts were higher than that of placebo up to the 2426 hour time point data are means with error bars showing standard error of the mean or sem asterisk indicates pvalue 005 

vegfa protein levels in patients in part a of the phase 1ab trial 

the bioactivity of the vegfa protein post injection of mrna was observed by an increase in blood flow at injection sites up to 7 days following a single injection as shown in the figure below measurements were made using laser doppler imaging 7 and 14 days after administration study part a n  27 data shown are means with error bars showing sem asterisk indicates pvalue 005 

vegfa led to increase in blood flow at day 7 and day 14 in patients in the phase 1ab trial 

as shown above administration of azd8601 demonstrated protein production and changes in local blood flow in diabetic patients tolerability of our mrna injected intradermally was demonstrated for all dose levels the only causally treatmentrelated adverse events were mild injectionsite reactions occurring in 32 of 33 participants receiving vegfa mrna across both parts of the study design all adverse events of injectionsite reaction were of mild intensity no deaths serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred the program is currently in a phase 2a clinical trial it is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multicenter phase 2a study to evaluate safety and tolerability of epicardial injections of azd8601 during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery some of the outcomes to be monitored in the phase 2a study include adverse and serious adverse events electrocardiogram or ecg and lvef the study is being conducted in europe the study is intentionally designed to provide initial safety and tolerability data in about 24 coronary artery bypass patients 

systemic intracellular therapeutics modality 

we designed our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality to increase levels of intracellular proteins using cells in the human body to produce proteins located in the cytosol or specific organelles of the cell to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide intracellular proteins such as intracellular enzymes and organellespecific proteins as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies our initial focus within this exploratory modality is on rare genetic diseases this modality currently has four programs pa mma pku and gsd1a 

systemic intracellular therapeutics opportunity 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics focus on areas currently not addressable with recombinant proteins which are typically administered systemically and cannot reach the inside of the cell objectives for potential new therapies in this area include for example increasing the levels of 

• intracellular pathway proteins 

• soluble organellespecific proteins and 

• organellespecific membrane proteins 

systemic intracellular therapeutics product features 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins 

our potential advantages in these areas include 

• using mrna to encode for intracellular and organellespecific proteins our modality permits the expression of intracellular proteins including those that must be directly translated and moved into organelles such as mitochondria the ability of mrna to produce protein inside of the cell enables production of these protein types that we believe are beyond the reach of recombinant proteins 

• mrna can produce hardtomake or complex proteins for example some proteins due to their folding requirements or complexity are challenging to make using recombinant technologies but can potentially be produced by human cells using administered mrna 

• native posttranslational modifications are possible through intracellular protein production using mrna mrna administered to a human cell uses natural secretory pathways inside the cell to make and process the encoded protein the resulting posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation are human as opposed to recombinant proteins where these posttranslational modifications are native to the nonhuman cells used for manufacture these nonhuman posttranslational modifications in recombinant proteins may lead to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes side effects and increased immunogenicity 

• mrna can sustain production of proteins which can increase exposure to proteins with short halflives  mrna can lead to protein production by cells that can last from hours to days depending on design this feature could increase the levels of short halflife proteins for therapeutic benefit 

• mrna allows for desirable pharmacology in complex metabolic diseases our mrna technology potentially permits several differentiated pharmacologic features for treating complex metabolic diseases including the ability to repeat dose as needed a rapid onset of action the ability to adjust dose levels realtime based on individual patient needs and the ability to stop dosing gene therapies may also prove to be useful for treating rare genetic diseases however mrna is not limited by preexisting immunity that may exist for certain gene therapies using viral vectors and does not localize to the nucleus or require persistent changes to cellular dna to have the desired effect 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 

we aim to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme complex to treat a pediatric metabolic disorder 

propionic acidemia or pa is a rare lifethreatening inherited metabolic disorder due to a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase or pcc it primarily affects the pediatric population there is no approved therapy for pa including no approved enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of the enzyme which comprises six copies each of two different subunits pcca and pccb and its mitochondrial localization the only effective treatment for severely affected individuals is liver transplant aimed at increasing enzyme activity to reduce the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic crises our platform is uniquely positioned to potentially address this disease by enabling synthesis of this complex enzyme that is localized in the mitochondria of the cell we are developing an ivadministered mrna therapeutic comprising two different mrnas encoding pcca and pccb in our proprietary lnp to replace the defective pcc enzyme with functional enzyme in liver and other cells we have received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission for the pa program the fda has also granted fast track designation to mrna3927 we plan to initiate a phase 12 clinical trial in pa patients in 2021 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 disease overview 

pa is an inherited metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality and no approved therapy 

pa is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder closely related to mma with significant morbidity and mortality there are approximately 3252000 pa patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0212100000 newborns and mortality rates the vast majority of patients present with lifethreatening metabolic crises during the first days or weeks of life with mortality rates ranging from 1353 during the neonatal period similar to mma the cardinal feature of the disorder is the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic decompensations that are more frequent in the first few years of life longer term sequelae include cardiac complications cardiomyopathy arrhythmias and severe neurologic complications 

the disorder is caused by a defect or deficiency in pcc an enzyme that is one step upstream in the same metabolic pathway as the mut enzyme that is deficient in mma pcc is a complex heterododecamer enzyme composed of six alpha subunits pcca and six beta subunits pccb the disorder is autosomal recessive with pa patients generally having lossoffunction mutations in either pcca or pccb and in rare instances mutations in both pcca and pccb to date over 100 mutations have been identified for both pcca and pccb genes and similar to mma most of the mutations are private also similar to mma due to this enzyme deficiency resulting in a metabolic block the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 3hydroxypropionic acid and 2methylcitrate among others and these metabolites may be used as biomarkers of disease 

there is no approved therapy for pa to treat the underlying defect including no enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of pcc and mitochondrial localization carglumic acid marketed as carbaglu is approved in the eu for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including pa management of the disorder is otherwise limited to strict dietary restrictions and other supportive measures similar to mma liver transplant is a radical yet effective treatment with the aim of increasing pcc enzyme activity in liver for severely affected individuals 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 our product concept 

we are utilizing the strength of our platform to produce a complex enzyme comprising two different proteins that localize to the mitochondria 

the ability of our platform to encode for large multimeric complexes such as pcc and enable production of intracellular mitochondrial proteins makes mrna especially suited to potentially address pa we are developing an ivadministered combination mrna approach which contains two mrnas one for each of the subunits of pcc pcca and pccb encapsulated in our proprietary lnp the intent is to potentially treat the entire pa population regardless of whether an individual has a defect or deficiency in the pcc alpha or beta subunit the mrna sequences have been engineered to improve protein translation and encode enzymaticallyactive pcc with the proper subcellular localization in the mitochondria 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated activity in a pa mouse model in a longterm repeat dose study 

a series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies have been performed to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for the combined pcca and pccb mrna therapy pcca and pccb mrnas administered in pa patient fibroblasts both pcca and pccbdeficient showed production of active pcc enzyme with the proper subcellular localization in mitochondria at concentrations above wildtype levels in vivo studies in pa pcca  a138t mice have resulted in a dosedependent increase in hepatic pcc activity with a concomitant decrease in disease biomarkers notably a reduction in plasma ammonia levels was observed 34 weeks after a single iv administration 1 mgkg of pcca and pccb mrna encapsulated in our proprietary lnp in pa mice n45group the data are shown in panel a of the figure below additionally a 6month repeatdose study in pa mice showed decreased heart weight normalized to body weight in mice treated with monthly iv administration of pcca and pccb mrna 1 mgkg compared to control mrna n6group this is shown in panel b of the figure below data in both panels is presented as mean ± standard deviation

isolated methylmalonic academia or mma is a rare lifethreatening inherited metabolic disorder that is primarily caused by a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonylcoenzyme a mutase or mut it primarily affects the pediatric population there is no approved therapy that addresses the underlying disorder including no approved enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of the protein and its mitochondrial localization liver or combined liverkidney transplant is one option for severely affected individuals our platform may allow the cells in the human body to produce these and other complex mitochondrial enzymes therefore we are developing an ivadministered mrna encoding mut in our proprietary lnp in order to restore this deficient or defective mitochondrial enzyme in the liver and other cells we have observed preclinical proofofconcept in two different mma mouse models notably with a marked improvement in survival and reduction of biochemical abnormalities in a severe mma mouse model we recently ceased development of mrna3704 and will return to the clinic with the next generation formulation mrna3705 to date the new drug product mrna3705 has demonstrated greater potency and prolonged lowering of methylmalonic acid in mutase deficient mice when compared to mrna3704 mrna3705 has received 

rare pediatric disease designation from the fda a phase 12 clinical study with mrna3705 is in planning and will be initiated in 2021 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3705 disease overview 

mma is a rare lifethreatening pediatric disorder with no approved therapies that address the underlying defect 

there are an estimated 5002000 mma mut deficiency patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0312100000 newborns and mortality rates mortality is significant with mortality rates of 50 for mma patients with complete mut deficiency mut 0  median age of death 2 years and 40 for mma patients with partial mut deficiency mut   median age of death 45 years reported in a large european study 

mma mainly affects the pediatric population and usually presents in the first few days or weeks of life the occurrence of acute metabolic decompensations is the hallmark of the disorder and decompensations are typically more frequent in the first few years of life each decompensation is lifethreatening and often requires hospitalization and management at an intensive care unit surviving patients often suffer from numerous complications including chronic renal failure and neurologic complications such as movement disorders developmental delays and seizures consequently the healthrelated quality of life for mma patients and their families is significantly impaired 

the disorder is autosomal recessive and primarily caused by lossoffunction mutations in the gene encoding mut a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes certain proteins and fats resulting in complete mut 0  or partial mut   enzyme deficiency there are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for mma carglumic acid marketed as carbaglu is approved in the eu for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including mma liver transplant and combined liverkidney transplant have emerged as effective treatment options for severely affected individuals resulting in substantial reductions in metabolic decompensations and circulating methylmalonic acid concentrations 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3705 our product concept 

we are utilizing our ability to produce a complex intracellular enzyme mut that is localized to the mitochondria 

mut is a complex intracellular enzyme that exists as a homodimer and requires mitochondrial localization and engagement with its cofactor a derivative of vitamin b 12  to be enzymatically active mrna has the capability to encode any type of protein including a functional intracellular protein that is trafficked to the proper subcellular localization within target cells 

we are developing an mrna encoding human mut encapsulated in our proprietary lnps for iv administration for the treatment of isolated mma associated with mut deficiency the sequence has been engineered to improve protein translation to function the mrnaencoded mut protein is translocated to its site of action in the mitochondria 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3705 preclinical information 

mrna3705 shows greater potency and more prolonged lowering of plasma methylmalonic acid compared to mrna3704 in animal studies 

we previously demonstrated in a series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies that human mut mrna effectively directs the biosynthesis of active mut protein with physiologically correct mitochondrial localization in vitro  and improves survival and corrects biochemical abnormalities in two different mouse models of mma representing the spectrum of mut deficiency mut 0 and mut   as published by us in cell reports in 2017 and ebiomedicine in 2019 technology and process improvements enabled the development of an updated drug product mrna3705 which shows greater potency and better pharmacology compared to mrna3704 as shown in the figure below mrna3705 produced approximately 3times more mut protein than mrna3704 in livers of rats 24 hours after a single intravenous injection 

mrna3705mrna3705 produced higher levels of mut protein in the livers of rats compared to mrna3704 

in mma mice with partial mut deficiency  mut  tg inscbag715v  mut   mrna3705 showed greater potency and prolonged the reduction in plasma methylmalonic acid levels compared to mrna3704 in a 4week study as shown in the figure below this data suggests that the minimal efficacious dose may be lower for mrna3705 than for mrna3704 

mrna3705 treatment produced a greater and more sustained reduction in plasma methylmalonic acid compared to mrna3704 in a 4week study in mut  mice 

furthermore mrna3705 treatment of a more severe mma mouse model  mut  tg insmck mut  mut 0  improved survival increased body weight and produced a sustained reduction of plasma methylmalonic acid levels compared to pbs treatment in a 12week study 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3705 clinical plan 

we are conducting a global natural history study and a phase 12 clinical trial in north america and europe 

we are conducting a global natural history study in methylmalonic acidemia or mma and propionic acidemia or pa that was initiated in 2018 our natural history study aims to identify and correlate clinical and biomarker endpoints for both mma and pa the natural history study is a global multicenter noninterventional study for patients with confirmed diagnosis of mma due to 

mut deficiency or pa up to 60 mma patients and up to 60 pa patients in the united states and europe will be followed prospectively for 13 years enrollment in the study has been completed retrospective data are also being collected as available 

we recently ceased development of mrna3704 and will return to the clinic with the next generation formulation mrna3705 the new drug product mrna3705 has demonstrated greater potency and prolonged lowering of methylmalonic acid in mutase deficient mice when compared to mrna3704 an openlabel multicenter dose finding phase 12 study of mrna3705 in patients with isolated mma due to mut deficiency between 1 to 18 years of age is in planning and will enter clinic in 2021 the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety pharmacodynamics as assessed by changes in plasma methylmalonic acid and pharmacokinetic profile of mrna3705 in patients affected by mma 

phenylketonuria pku mrna3283 

our approach to phenylketonuria with an mrna encoding for an intracellular protein 

phenylketonuria or pku is a rare inherited metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency in the metabolism of phenylalanine or phe due to mutations within the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or pah the most effective treatment is a restrictive diet of low protein which controls phe intake approximately 2056 of pku patients respond to sapropterin dihydrochloride marketed as kuvan in the united states a synthetic bh4 cofactor for pah which improves phe metabolism but does not fully cure patients in addition in may 2018 biomarin received approval for pegylated phenylalanine lyase or pal marketed as palynziq palynziq is a pegylated recombinant bacterial enzyme which metabolizes phe in the blood we believe the immune risk is at least in part driven by bacterial pal with our mrna technology cells in the human body can be instructed to produce functional pah decreasing phe levels in the blood and restoring production of tyrosine we are developing an intravenously administered mrna which encodes for the pah enzyme and is encapsulated in our proprietary lnp we plan to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial for mrna3283 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 disease overview 

there are options to treat pku which are not widely applicable and efforts by other companies are likely to face hurdles 

pku occurs in approximately 11000015000 live births in the united states  based on current population estimates that would translate into approximately 2100032000 pku patients in the united states affected individuals have a deficiency in the enzyme pah resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine thus pku patients suffer from a phenylalanine intoxication and a subsequent deprivation of tyrosine leading to severe mental disability if left untreated 

pah is expressed as a monomer but functions as a tetramer and requires tetrahydrobiopterin bh4 as a cofactor to complete the conversion of phe to tyrosine thereby maintaining adequate phetyr ratios within circulation to date greater than 950 gene variants have been identified in the pah gene resulting in pku 

diagnosis of pku occurs primarily through newborn screening in available countries followed by genetic confirmation newly diagnosed patients receive medical formulas containing protein with low phe content to control blood phe and provide adequate nutrition for growing infants as patients age they are tested for sensitivity to synthetic bh4 and may transition to kuvan approximately 20 of patients respond favorably to kuvan which can aid in phe control nonresponsive patients are treated mainly with restricted diet however adherence to the diet is challenging resulting in poor compliance when phe levels are not adequately controlled patients begin to show multiple signs of disease including depression anxiety poor executive function and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or adhd 

one option for pku patients may be treatment with gene therapy we believe there are potential advantages for mrna therapeutics for this disorder over gene therapy as described in the systemic intracellular therapeutics modality section 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce pah intracellularly 

we believe mrna therapy is a viable therapeutic modality for pku patients due to its ability to instruct cells in the human body to produce complex functional intracellular proteins such as pah our program mrna3283 consists of an mrna encoding human pah encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the mrna sequence is optimized for protein synthesis and contains a microrna 

binding site to reduce or potentially eliminate synthesis of protein outside of the target tissues mrna3283 is designed to be administered intravenously to encode enzymaticallyactive pah protein in liver to restore this deficient or defective enzyme 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to impact phe levels by repeat dosing of our mrna in preclinical studies 

we have conducted several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for pah therapy a pku mouse model demonstrated a significant reduction of blood phe levels post dose as shown in the figure below the study included iv administration of pah mrna every 7 days at 05 mgkg in a pah mouse model phe level was measured using liquid chromatography with a combination of two mass analyzers lcmsms the indenabling glp toxicology program for pku mrna3283 is ongoing 

phe reduction with repeat dosing of pah mrna in pku mouse model study 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 clinical plan 

we plan to conduct a phase 1 open label clinical trial with single ascending dose to evaluate the safety tolerability and activity of our development candidate in patients 

glycogen storage disease type 1a gsd1a mrna3745 

our approach to glycogen storage disease type 1a using an mrna encoding for intracellular human glucose 6phosphatase 

glycogen storage disease type 1a gsd1a is an inherited metabolic disease caused by the deficiency in the catalytic activity of glucose 6phosphatase g6pase which is encoded by the glucose 6phosphatase gene g6pc the g6pase enzyme is involved in the metabolic pathways of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis which allow the liver and kidney to release glucose into the blood those affected by gsd1a present with lifethreatening hypoglycemia and a wide range of severe metabolic derangements and longterm complications such as hyperlipidemia lactic acidemia hepatomegaly hepatocellular adenomas and endstage renal disease the standard of care consists of strict diet control enzyme replacement therapy ert is not an option for these patients due to challenges associated with delivering an enzyme inside the cell strict diet control via the frequent consumption of uncooked cornstarch is effective in improving hypoglycemia however the underlying pathologies continue and its efficacy in preventing the longterm metabolic complications has yet to be established with our mrna platform cells in the liver may be instructed to produce functional g6pase with the goal of restoring the homeostasis of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways and correcting the underlying pathologies we are developing an intravenously administered mrna which encodes for g6pase and is encapsulated in our proprietary lnp we have demonstrated activity in mouse models in the form of reduction in both liver and serum biomarkers and improvements in liver morphology we plan to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial for mrna3745 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 disease overview 

there are no approved therapies for gsd1a that address the enzymatic deficiency 

gsd1a is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the catalytic activity of g6pase g6pase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose6phosphate to glucose and inorganic phosphate the final step of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis that mainly takes place in liver and kidney gsd1a patients suffer from severe fasting hypoglycemia hepatomegaly nephromegaly lactic acidemia hypertriglyceridemia hyperuricemia hypercholesterolemia hepatic steatosis and growth retardation in addition hepatocellular adenomas occur in 70 to 80 of gsd1a patients by their third decade of life and carries risk of transformation into hepatocellular carcinomas proteinuria has been observed in over half of patients above 25 years of age 

gsd1a occurs in approximately 1100000 live births in the united states and european union but is more common in ashkenazi jews where the incidence is reported to be 120000 live births there are an estimated 2500 people in the united states and over 4000 people in the european union with gsd1a although strict diet therapy including frequent feeding with uncooked cornstarch allows gsd1a patients to live into adulthood by preventing hypoglycemia the underlying pathological processes remain uncorrected resulting in the development of many longterm complications including liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma while gene therapy is being investigated for treatment of gsd1a we believe there are potential advantages for mrna therapeutics for this disorder over gene therapy 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce g6pase intracellularly 

we believe that our platform can address gsd1a with its ability to instruct cells in the human body to produce complex functional intracellular membrane proteins such as g6pase our program mrna3745 consists of an mrna encoding for modified human g6pase encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the human g6pase sequence is modified for improved protein production and g6pase activity mrna3745 is designed to be administered intravenously and encodes g6pase protein to restore this deficient or defective enzyme 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to improve hypoglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities associated with gsd1a in a mouse model 

we have conducted several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for gsd1a therapy mrna encoding for g6pase introduced in human cells resulted in robust production of active g6pase with subcellular localization into endoplasmic reticulum we have examined the activity of mrna encoding for human g6pase in a liverspecific g6pase  mouse model g6pclko like gsd1a patients the g6pclko mice are unable to produce endogenous glucose leading to severe hypoglycemia during the fasting state 

in a doseresponse study performed in g6pclko mice we treated the mice with three different doses of 02 05 and 1 mgkg of g6pase mrna encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and examined fasting glucose serum triglycerides and liver enzymes n58 of note mice treated with g6pase mrna showed a dosedependent improvement in fasting glycemia and a reduction in serum triglycerides without a significant increase in liver enzymes eg alanine transaminase  alt fasting blood glucose and triglycerides are shown in the figure below each bar represents the mean ± standard deviation single and double asterisk denotes p  005 and p  00001 respectively by oneway anova followed by dunnett’s posthoc test for multiple comparisons 

serum biomarkers after single dose of g6pase mrna in g6pclko mice 

in the same study a reduction in liver weight compared to the controltreated group was observed after 24 hours of administration of g6pase encoded mrna in lnp the reduction in liver weight was associated with significant improvement in liver morphology presumably due to reduction in liver glucose 6phosphate glycogen and triglycerides 

reduction in liver weight 24 hours after iv administration of g6pase mrna in g6pclko mice 

in addition data for a 7week repeatdose study in g6pclko mice receiving g6pase mrna in lnp at 025 mgkg iv every other week have shown a pronounced improvement in fasting glycemia in comparison with the g6pclko mice receiving a control mrna treatment as shown below n79 

restoration of blood glucose above therapeutic threshold with repeat dosing of g6pase mrna in g6pclko mice 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial 

we plan to conduct an openlabel dose escalation phase 1 study of mrna3745 in adolescent and adult patients with gsd1a in the united states the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna3745 to assess the pharmacodynamic response through changes in maintenance of euglycemia and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of mrna3745 

manufacturing product supply and technical development 

manufacturing plays a critical role in our value chain and our ability to develop a new class of medicines our manufacturing capabilities support our research and early development engines in addition to our late stage development and commercial engines these capabilities have rapidly accelerated as a result of covid19 vaccine production 

within the research engine manufacturing provides mrna drug substance and drug product for platform research and therapeutic area drug discovery for the early development engine we manufacture mrna and drug product for indenabling glp toxicology studies and initial human clinical studies for the late stage development engine we produce mrna and drug product for phase 3 studies in addition within the commercial engine we manufacture drug substance and drug product in collaboration with our contract manufacturing organizations or cmos both in the us and internationally our approach to date has been to proactively invest and build manufacturing capacity internally and externally with our network of strategic partners in anticipation of demand this capacity planning was immediately leveraged and expanded during our covid19 vaccine rampup into a commercial product in response to the ongoing pandemic 

overview of our manufacturing operating model 

our manufacturing activities focus on the following 

• commercial production our manufacturing expertise includes stateoftheart technologies for mrna and drug product manufacturing as well as quality control testing to attain a robust and consistent supply that matches target product profiles our manufacturing technology is built to scaleup and support industrialization of products for commercial approval 

• research and development support the product supply enables platform research and drug discovery in our therapeutic and vaccine areas in addition to activities related to clinical studies of our investigational medicines 

given our expectations for significant ongoing pipeline expansion and the long lead time required to build manufacturing infrastructure we built a dedicated inhouse manufacturing facility in norwood ma moderna technology center mtc the campus is comprised of two distinct buildings mtc south and mtc north mtc south is approximately 200000 square feet with a production capacity of over 100 cgmp lots per year mtc north is approximately 240000 square feet directly supporting improvement in our manufacturing capabilities mtc supports our research engine supply indenabling glp toxicology study supplies our phase 1 and phase 2 pipeline activities laterstage clinical development activities eg phase 3 cmv vaccine clinical trials as well as covid19 vaccine drug substance production 

the mtc campus has been designed with a high level of automation and stateoftheart digital integration to handle manufacturing execution product testing and release and regulatory filings in addition substantial manufacturing capabilities are realized via cmo relationships in the us and abroad providing drug substance and fill finish capacity for the covid19 vaccine 

manufacturing technology development 

to support our broad pipeline of products which span multiple therapeutic areas and routes of administration eg intramuscular intratumoral and intravenous there is close collaboration between our platform research and technical development teams to facilitate rapid and seamless clinical translation of scientific breakthroughs this in turn enables us to develop potential vaccines and therapies to serve a widening patient population 

technical development encompasses the design and optimization of robust and consistent manufacturing processes product characterization fitforpurpose formulations and product presentations for instance our novel hardware platforms’ automation and robotics coupled with the flexibility of our inhouse digital development systems allows for thousands of experiments and process parameters across our projects thus supporting our drug product pharmaceutical readiness moreover our recent technical manufacturing advances have enabled internalization of new key capabilities including dna plasmids and small molecules 

in parallel we have refined existing processes resulting in increased manufacturing scale and more robust stability of our mrna and drug product these improvements allow us significant control over our supply chain resulting in larger production yields and longer shelf life of our products furthermore formulation development advancements have added new drug product images including lyophilization giving us a path from frozen to refrigerated storage conditions 

our substantial investments in recent years in technical development enabled the breadth and depth of our pipeline and laid the foundation to help meet the needs and requirements associated with late stage development and the commercialization of the covid19 vaccine 

supply of mrna for the research and early development engines 

supply for the research engine 

highthroughput automation and custom engineered equipment allow us to produce and deliver high quality mrna and formulated constructs in a short period of time our proprietary platform is capable of producing up to 1000 lots of mrna sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks from sequence to final product the typical scale of mrna manufactured by this team is 1–1000 mg since 2014 we have produced over 27000 batches of researchgrade mrna this has been possible in part thanks to the ability of researchers in the moderna ecosystem to order constructs through an integrated digital portal that tracks materials endtoend in less than 45 days in addition multiple integrated algorithms that leverage artificial intelligence and machine learning optimize manufacturability reduce failures and increase quality of mrna sequences 

supply for the early development engine 

analogous to the research engine we have established manufacturing capabilities that support the early development engine in three key areas glp tox clinical studies and personalized cancer vaccines we supply mrna and formulated product to conduct indenabling glp toxicology studies in addition human clinical studies rely on supply to meet required cgmp standards this is achieved via internal manufacturing at mtc and external manufacturing at wellestablished contract manufacturing organizations cmos we selected specialized cmos to support a total of five programs in late 2015 we will continue to selectively partner with cmos to complement our capacity and provide supply contingency where needed our mtc facility is also suited to enable rapid technology development and scaleup for future needs our manufacturing also produces cgmp personalized cancer vaccines pcvs due to the specialized nature of personalized medicine ie where a batch is specifically designed and manufactured for a single patient the manufacturing personalized vaccine unit pvu has unique requirements we digitally integrate patientspecific data from sequencing tumor samples to automatically design pcvs for patients we have developed proprietary bioinformatics designed algorithms linked to an automated manufacturing process for rapid production of formulated mrna with a typical turnaround time of a few weeks we have operationalized pcv manufacturing at the mtc campus to meet our phase 1 and 2 pipeline supply needs by using singleuse systems with fast “needletoneedle” turnaround times unlike traditional process development each pcv batch is manufactured for a single patient and thus scaledout in parallel with extensive use of automation and robotics to account for the larger number of patients involved in later phases of development and commercialization we have shown consistent quality in our production of over 160 patient batches each with unique mrna sequences 

these capabilities have allowed us to build our broad pipeline of 24 development candidates including the output required to supply related toxicological and human clinical studies while the technology that underpins these 24 programs is the same each program typically requires customization based on target product profiles these custom features range from varying molecular architecture to different routes of administration often requiring multivalent products for example our cmv vaccine mrna1647 requires six different mrna sequences to be manufactured for inclusion in an intramuscular mrna medicine whereas ox40l mrna2416 requires a single mrna sequence for inclusion in an intratumoral mrna medicine all programs with the exception of pcv require that we progressively scale up supply to meet clinical demand requirements across development phases in addition to the necessary preparation for regulatory approval and commercial production which demand larger batch sizes in contrast the pcv program seeks to develop a cancer vaccine that is designed and manufactured for a specific patient thus increasing the number of unique batches as we scale manufacturing output for each program we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates 

supply for the latestage development and commercialization engines 

as we manufacture the covid19 vaccine our development pipeline continues to advance to laterstage development and towards commercialization our platform approach allows us to continue to evolve our manufacturing suites and other capabilities at our mtc campus building expansions and enhancements have continued throughout scaleup of our covid19 vaccine manufacturing capabilities the modular nature of the mtc suites permits us to manufacture multiple products in parallel for instance we can produce drug substance and drug product for our phase 3 cmv clinical trial while manufacturing covid19 drug substance 

quality unit 

quality is core to the way we operate we seek to ensure quality at moderna through a combination of a robust quality management system qms our quality culture and our people in accordance with applicable regulations we have established documented and implemented a qms to assure continued compliance with the requirements therein the qms facilitates cgmp compliance by implementing practices that identify the various required processes their application throughout the organization and the sequence of interaction of these processes 

the primary mode of documenting these key practices is through policies standard operating procedures sops forms and other quality records which include an overarching quality policy and quality manual we have implemented measurement tools and metrics to monitor measure and analyze these practices to support cgmp operations achieve planned results and support continuous improvement we monitor these quality metrics through formal governance processes including quality management review qmr to enable continuous improvement we have also established an independent quality unit that fulfills quality assurance and quality control responsibilities 

our quality unit grew into an international organization with the introduction of covid19 vaccine manufacturing quality drives our quality culture and ensures it is applied consistently and thoughtfully across the globe 

while the quality unit is ultimately accountable and responsible for quality this is everyone’s responsibility all cgmp personnel are empowered to ensure quality systems are appropriately maintained and executed 

we have established a culture that encourages transparency accountability and ownership of quality at all levels in the organization as we scale the quality organization we have focused on hiring the best talent with the required experience training and education 

supply chain unit 

we have established an international supply chain to enable supply of the raw materials used to produce our mrnas and the components of our formulations securing supply for covid19 vaccine alongside clinical and preclinical demands we have worked with our supply chain vendors to characterize critical raw materials and to understand their impact on the quality of mrna drug substance and formulated drug product we also assess the quality system and performance of our supply chain vendors and work with them to comply with regulatory requirements 

digital infrastructure 

we believe that digital technologies such as robotics automation artificial intelligence or ai and cloud computing are critical to operationalize our strategy accelerate our pace of learning and execute at scale since our inception we have invested over 100 million in our digital technologies roboticsautomation analytics data science and ai given our growth we expect we will invest more than an additional 100 million in digital over the next 5 years our approach to bring these digital technologies into our workflows and processes has involved the following 

• utilization of a consistent set of digital building blocks 

• application of digital technologies in multiple business processes and 

• rapid iterations for maximum optimization 

we have seen several benefits from our investments in digitization most importantly through the depth of our platform technology and breadth of our pipeline other benefits include 

• quality reduction in human errors by enabling automation repeatability and seamless integration 

• scalability growth in our pipeline to 24 programs 

• speed rapid manufacture of researchgrade mrna from the research engine and 

• cost efficiencies digital infrastructure utilized across our platform drug discovery clinical development and manufacturing to maximize efficiencies 

our digital building blocks 

we utilize six building blocks for our digital infrastructure 

• cloud enablement is a critical component of our digital infrastructure we are at the forefront of mrna technology we generate complex data sets and our scientists need computational power and agility to operate without being limited by traditional computing technology maintaining digital infrastructure in the cloud provides the benefits of lower costs by simplifying provisioning and administration flexibility scalability ease of maintenance disaster recovery and information security 

• integration of business processes enables us to streamline processes and bring data together in a consistent manner avoiding caches of information and manual intervention this efficient flow of data between systems enables the automation of our business processes 

• internet of things allows for smart interconnected devices that provide realtime synchronization of operations the data from equipment provides realtime guidance to our scientists and engineers and helps us in supply chain and manufacturing with compliance and traceability including tracking material controlling inventory and optimizing instrument usage 

• automation allows us to scale our operations reliably and reproducibly with the help of custom hardware solutions and stateoftheart robotics we can continue to increase our operating efficiency reduce errors and improve our quality and compliance 

• advanced analytics enable us to draw insights from our data we are constantly generating large data sets that can provide important insights if mined appropriately and regularly 

• artificial intelligence  or ai is enabling key breakthroughs in predictive modeling it will allow us to improve our mrna design algorithms based on machine learning and will provide us with critical insights into research supply chain manufacturing and other processes 

digital technologies to enable our research engine 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies across our research engine to drive a rapid pace of learning enable efficient workflows and business processes and draw insights from vast amounts of data our aim is to provide our platform and discovery scientists with access to an environment that helps them through each step of their research cycle 

drug design studio our proprietary inhouse digital application suite contains a sequence designer module to tailor an entire mrna with everimproving rule sets that contain our accumulated learning about mrna design drug design studio utilizes cloudbased computational capacity to run various algorithms we have developed to design each mrna sequence the utility of cloudbased capacity allows us to provide flexible computational capacity on demand allowing the research engine to power parallel intake and design of multiple mrna sequences once a sequence is designed it can be ordered digitally using an internal order form application within drug design studio 

manufacture of research grade mrna once an order is optimized the mrna production process is triggered we have developed proprietary interfaces that allow the manufacturing team to track production orders at every stage we have automated several manufacturing steps using both offtheshelf and custom automation the equipment used in the manufacture of researchgrade mrna is integrated with the digital interfaces to capture extract and interpret the data generated at each step of the manufacturing process building digital traceability on each mrna order we have also embedded realtime algorithms and analytics tools to allow for automated decisionmaking at some stages accelerate the quality control workflows and provide for continuous improvement of manufacturing processes 

dispatching and shipping mrna because we produce large quantities of researchgrade mrna we require digital tools to track their shipment to our scientists and to external contract research organizations or cros conducting in vivo studies our dispatching and shipping application automatically generates barcoded labels allowing for traceability of product 

inventory and registry material used in research and created in production including mrna cell lines chemicals and reagents is tracked in our inventory application this application supports numerous workflow tools such as consumption aliquoting material transfer and stock alerts critical material types are assigned unique registry identification by our registry application 

study design using our drug design studio our scientists can design their in vivo studies using our proprietary study design application this application captures in vivo study protocol design parameters including dose amount number of doses frequency samples and assays for each sample this application serves two purposes it allows our scientists to maintain and track their in vivo study designs and associated research grade mrna our study design application also allows our in vivo pharmacology teams to track the various ongoing studies and leverage external cros to manage the in vivo demand as needed 

experiment management we have deployed electronic lab notebooks for experiment management allowing our scientists to streamline documentation of their experiments and track it in a standardized searchable repository we have also integrated electronic lab notebooks further with our other research tools to connect inventory in vivo studies and instrument data 

advanced analytics and ai to accelerate the pace of learning we utilize ai to enable various parts of our platform and drug discovery examples include 

• neural networks for protein engineering  one way to optimize the efficacy of the proteins encoded by our mrna is to engineer the sequence of the protein itself we use neural networks to analyze and model protein sequences we train these models by inputting orthologous sequences from thousands of organisms from which we can generate potential protein sequences optimized for specific attributes 

• neural networks for mrna engineering  the redundancy in the genetic code allows for a large number of mrna sequences that encode the same protein mrna sequence may impact translation thereby impacting the amount of protein produced in circulation we are developing ai tools to predict mrna sequences that can enhance protein expression 

• automated sanger sequencing analysis  sanger sequencing is us used repeatedly to quality check or qc our dna templates and final mrna while the data contain every nucleotide in a sequence it is very complex to analyze a fully automated data pipeline starts processing raw data the moment it is saved to the cloud by the sequencers the pipeline spawns numerous aws computer servers to run an analysis algorithm and then shuts the servers down resulting in minimal costs the results are viewable in a powerful dynamic visualization tool we have run over 3 million sanger data files through this system we have further improved our sanger analysis with a convolutional neural network or cnn to better analyze the tail sections of mrna as well 

digital technologies to enable our early development engine 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies across our early development engine to drive the rapid pace of advancement in parallel of our development candidates into the clinic 

digital systems for cgmp manufacture we are committed to having integrated systems connected with robotics to drive our manufacturing in a paperless environment and have designed and deployed automation to drive efficient manufacturing operations we have also deployed digital tools within manufacturing process development that give us the ability to track analyze and rapidly deploy manufacturing process improvements additionally we have implemented several digital systems across manufacturing process development quality supply chain and operations including

• our clinical operations application allows us to track our ongoing trials by accessing clinical operations information in realtime from our cros it also has multiple tools and analytics to draw key insights including for example enrollment by trial and enrollment by site to maintain our program timelines 

digital systems for pcv the pcv program aims to design manufacture and deliver a drug product that includes an mrna sequence encoding for each patient’s specific neoantigens the personalized nature of the pcv program adds additional steps and complexity in the overall patient treatment process we have addressed those additional steps and complexity by digitizing and automating steps within the process as described below 

• each patient is provided a unique identifier we track the entire workflow using a single integrated tracker based on this unique identifier this is one of many ways we ensure that each patient receives the specific drug product lot manufactured for them 

• we use neural networks to design the mrna sequences for the pcv program our proprietary vaccine design algorithm selects the top twenty neoantigens to be used and determines their amino acid sequences to trigger the desired immune response 

• we utilize monte carlo simulations of pcv supplydemand to manage our capacity since each drug product lot is personalized to a patient there is a need to manage supply and demand to avoid bottlenecks at any stage of the workflow 

digital systems for the commercial engine we are building our commercial engine to establish medical affairs engagements with doctors support our sales and marketing capabilities and deliver a worldclass patient experience in addition to a patient and doctorcentric view our commercial engine will strengthen our supply chain demand forecasting and our compliance we are looking at building a robust serialization process for regulatory requirements as well as anticounterfeiting technologies to ensure safe efficacious medicines to patients 

digital technologies to support our business processes 

we have deployed several digital systems across finance manufacturing and human resources to automate our business processes and drive efficiencies we have implemented the sap s4hana system for erp we have implemented various cloudbased solutions to improve business processes and drive efficiencies for example we have implemented the workday system for human resource planning and management and integrated various applications across payroll 401k services equity plan management and expense reporting our classleading integration platform dell boomi allows us to have a highly interconnected environment moving us from simple cloudtocloud integrations to an evolving use of the integration platform for master data management systems account management and ultimately for cost savings and improved user experience 

thirdparty strategic alliances 

strategic alliances 

to accelerate the discovery and advancement of potential mrna medicines across therapeutic areas we have entered into and intend to seek other opportunities to form alliances with a diverse group of strategic collaborators we have forged productive strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies government agencies academic laboratories foundations and research institutes with therapeutic area expertise and resources in an effort to advance our discovery and development programs while leveraging our platform and our research and early development engines 

one key principle of our approach to strategic alliances is to share the rewards and risks of developing a new mrna modality where we may have early research data and desire a strategic collaborator to join us in advancing early development candidates within such modality into the clinic representative relationships and associated programs include the following 

• astrazeneca for the localized regenerative therapeutics modality such as the vegfa program azd8601 currently in phase 2a 

• astrazeneca for the intratumoral immunooncology modality such as the il12 program medi1191 currently in phase 1 

• merck for the cancer vaccines modality such as the personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 currently in phase 2 using a workflow that enables a rapid turnaround time to bring personalized vaccines to patients and the kras vaccine program mrna5671 currently in phase 1 

• darpa for the systemic secreted therapeutics modality such as the antibody against chikungunya virus program mrna1944 currently in phase 1 

• vertex for the lung delivery modality such as the cystic fibrosis or cf and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator or cftr program currently in research 

• vertex for gene editing aimed at the discovery and development of lnps and mrnas for the delivery of geneediting therapies for the treatment of cf and 

• chiesi farmaceutici spa for the discovery and development of potential mrna medicines for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension 

we view strategic alliances as important drivers for accelerating execution of our goal of rapidly developing mrna medicines to treat patients across a wide range of medical and disease challenges to maintain the integrity of our platform the terms of our agreements with our strategic collaborators generally provide that our strategic collaborators receive rights to develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines that we design and manufacture as opposed to rights to use our platform to generate new mrna and that we generally own mrnarelated intellectual property arising from research activities performed under the strategic alliance we plan to continue to identify potential strategic collaborators who can contribute meaningful resources and insights to our programs and allow us to more rapidly expand our impact to broader patient populations

in june 2017 we entered into two sublicense agreements one with cellscript and one with mrt which agreements we collectively refer to as the cellscriptmrt agreements together the cellscriptmrt agreements grant us a worldwide sublicensable sublicense to the penn modified mrna patents to research develop make and commercialize products covered by the penn modified mrna patents or licensed products for all in vivo uses in humans and animals including therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic applications the cellscriptmrt agreements are nonexclusive although cellscript and mrt are subject to certain time restrictions on granting additional sublicenses for in vivo uses in humans under the penn modified mrna patents 

we paid cellscript and mrt aggregate sublicense grant fees of 28 million upon entering into the cellscriptmrt agreements 25 million in early 2018 and 22 million in early 2019 cellscript and mrt are collectively eligible to receive on a licensed productbylicensed product basis milestone payments totaling up to 05 million upon the achievement of certain regulatorybased events for diagnostic products and milestone payments totaling up to 15 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatorybased events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products and up to 24 million upon the achievement of certain commercialbased events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products the cellscriptmrt agreements require us to pay royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products at rates in the low single digits for therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic uses and royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products sold for research uses at rates in the midsingle digits subject to certain reductions with an aggregate minimum floor following the first commercial sale of licensed products under a cellscriptmrt agreement we are required to pay cellscript or mrt as applicable minimum annual royalties ranging from 10000—400000 depending on the use of such licensed product with all such payments creditable against earned royalties on net sales 

the cellscriptmrt agreements will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire or become abandoned of the penn modified mrna patents cellscript or mrt as applicable may terminate its respective cellscriptmrt agreement if we fail to make required payments or otherwise materially breach the applicable agreement subject to specified notice and cure provisions cellscript or mrt as applicable may also terminate the applicable cellscriptmrt agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the penn modified mrna patents we have the right to terminate each cellscriptmrt agreement at will upon 60 days’ prior notice to cellscript or mrt as applicable provided that we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products upon such termination if rights to mrt or cellscript under the penn modified mrna patents are terminated eg due to bankruptcy of mrt or cellscript the terminated party will assign its interest in the respective cellscriptmrt agreement to the licensor from which it received rights under the penn modified mrna patents and our rights will continue under the new licensor 

formulation technology inlicenses 

our development candidates use internally developed formulation technology that we own we do however have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents covering formulation technologies under licenses from other entities if in the future we elect to use or to grant our strategic collaborators sublicenses to use these inlicensed formulation technologies we or our strategic collaborators may be liable for milestone and royalty payment obligations arising from such use we consider the commercial terms of these licenses and their provisions regarding diligence insurance indemnification and other similar matters to be reasonable and customary for our industry 

in addition we have entered into material transfer agreements that have provided us with opportunities to evaluate third party delivery systems 

employees 

we had approximately 1300 fulltime employees as of december 31 2020 representing a 59 increase over our 830 fulltime employees as of the end of the prior year of our total fulltime employees as of december 31 2020 nearly 600 joined us during the course of the year this growth in our employee base has largely been as a result of developments related to our covid19 vaccine we have undertaken significant hiring of employees to facilitate manufacturing of the vaccine in addition to building out our commercial and regulatory organizations as well as other functions to support this rollout as part of this expansion we have also increased our hiring outside the united states during 2020 and at yearend we had employees in switzerland the united kingdom canada and spain much of this hiring has been of talent with experience at other pharmaceutical companies as we seek to build out our commercial and regulatory capabilities particularly at more senior levels of the company we have also continued to hire talent to support our research and clinical capabilities across the rest of our pipeline unrelated to our covid19 vaccine 

we operate in a highly competitive environment for human capital particularly as we seek to attract and retain talent with experience in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors our workforce is highly educated and as of december 31 2020 51 of our employees hold phd md jd or master’s degrees among our employees 46 are female and 54 are male among our leadership which we define as employees at the vice president level and above as of december 31 2020 approximately 37 are female an increase from 35 in the prior year 35 of our us employees identify as racially or ethnically diverse as of december 31 2020 an increase from 32 in the prior year in 2020 we expanded our emphasis on belonging inclusion  diversity creating a conscious inclusion education series for senior leaders conducting several internal seminars panels and discussions on inclusion launching a new employee resource group in support of our black and african american employees and adding a fulltime seniorlevel role focused on belonging equity inclusion and diversity 

to help promote alignment between our employees and our shareholders all employees participate in our equity programs through the receipt of new hire and annual equity grants and the percentage of equity as a component of overall pay mix increases with seniority we believe that in addition to incentivizing growth that leads to shareholder value broad eligibility for our equity programs helps promote employee retention as these awards generally vest over a fouryear period 

in response to the covid19 pandemic we undertook several initiatives to ensure the safety of our workforce and continuity of our operations we created a response team that was responsible for implementing safety measures testing at our cambridge and norwood sites this included regular covid19 testing temperature and health screening as well as implementing digital tools to facilitate contact tracing and providing personal protective equipment ppe throughout the pandemic much of our workforce has worked remotely wherever possible we also implemented remote hiring and onboarding programs to facilitate significant hiring during 2020 in a remote work environment in december 2020 following the receipt of an emergency use authorization from the fda for our covid19 vaccine we made the vaccine available to our employees and adult members of their households to help ensure continuity of our operations due to the critical nature of our production of the vaccine 

none of our employees is represented by a labor union and none of our employees has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us other than a small number of employees in spain who are covered by collective bargaining agreements governing certain benefits we consider our employee relations to be good 

we believe that our employees are highly engaged and we and our employees have been recognized by surveys conducted by external groups science magazine ranked us as a top employer for each of the last six years we measure employee engagement through a vendorsupplied engagement software using validated external benchmarks to track quarteroverquarter employee engagement factors 

our approach to attracting and retaining talent 

we are committed to ensuring that our employees find that their careers at moderna are filled with purpose growth and fulfillment we believe that a career at moderna provides opportunity for 

• impact  our people will have the opportunity to do work that is unparalleled in terms of its innovation and scope of impact on people’s lives

• compelling rewards  to attract and retain the best talent we provide competitive rewards that help to drive groundbreaking work and allow employees to share in the value we will create together including through our equity programs 

our approach to training our employees 

we have established a structured training curriculum for our employees called moderna university and have a fulltime team dedicated to developing the curriculum and conducting activities for moderna university the objective of moderna university is for every employee to be deeply familiar with our core technology and able to learn about technologies that might further enable our science in addition moderna university is also focused on creating strong leaders through management and leadership training there are four core areas within moderna university including 

• professional development  includes onsite training programs for our employees including for example leadership tools to improve interpersonal communication and project management 

• digital learning library  we have built an online library of videos of a variety of scientific material that our employees can access flexibly this content includes 

◦ presentations by external speakers to scientific seminars conducted inhouse 

◦ scientific courses at external universities and 

◦ peertopeer video series in which inhouse experts provide an introductory view of complex topics they tackle within their teams 

• learning management system  we have deployed a digital system to track and administer training programs for each of our employees training content is developed digitally and offered to our employees 

• new hire orientation  this program is designed to onboard all new employees during this training program new employees meet with the management team and senior functional leaders to learn about the company and functional activities 

to further develop and retain our workforce we conduct periodic talent reviews that identify key talent within the organization we use that data to inform specific development opportunities for key current and potential future leaders and to support our periodic succession planning activities for key roles these steps together ensure we have a robust understanding of our workforce and a talent pipeline to grow future leaders 

corporate social responsibility 

in pursuit of our mission to deliver on the promise of mrna science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients we have scaled our operations invested in research and hired toptier talent as we continue to mature we believe it is important to develop longterm programs that underscore our commitment to corporate social responsibility please refer to the “citizenship” section of our website which can be found at wwwmodernatxcom for a description of some of the measures we have taken to support our commitment to corporate social responsibility 

competition 

the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition there is also a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products 

we believe that mrna as a medicine coupled with our capabilities across mrna technology drug discovery development and manufacturing provide us with a competitive advantage however we will continue to face competition from different sources including major pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies academic institutions government agencies and public and private research institutions for any products that we eventually commercialize we will not only compete with existing therapies but also compete with new therapies that may become available in the future 

we face significant competition in the market for our covid19 vaccine particularly from established pharmaceutical companies with longer operating histories and significant experience in producing and marketing pharmaceutical products competition for the sale of our covid19 vaccine can be impacted by a number of factors including the efficacy of our vaccine in preventing covid19 particularly in the prevention of severe cases of covid19 the ability of our vaccine or future iterations of the vaccine to protect effectively against variants of the sarscov2 virus perceptions of the efficacy of our vaccine concerns about potential side effects from the vaccine its safety or tolerability the novelty of mrnabased technology storage and handling conditions for our vaccine and the ease or difficulty with which it can be distributed and the fact that our covid19 vaccine requires two doses whereas certain competitors’ vaccines may only require a single dose the competitiveness of our covid19 vaccine in the future may also depend upon whether we are successful in efforts to combine this with other vaccines like seasonal flu and whether our competitors are successful in these efforts our competitive positioning may also be affected by the fact that we do not have as long a history of producing pharmaceutical products or existing commercial relationships compared to certain of our competitors 

we compete in the segment of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries there are additional companies that are working on mrna medicines some of which have reached commercialization companies with mrna programs include biontech which has partnered with pfizer for the production and commercialization of a covid19 vaccine and curevac which also is developing a covid19 vaccine other competitors include etherna immunotherapies and translate bio and those with preclinical programs include arcturus therapeutics ethris genevant sciences stemirna therapeutics and glaxosmithkline we also compete against other pharmaceutical companies in the market for covid19 vaccines that do not utilize mrnabased technologies including astrazeneca and johnson  johnson among others 

government regulation 

government authorities in the united states at the federal state and local level and in other countries regulate among other things the research development testing manufacture quality control approval labeling packaging storage recordkeeping promotion advertising distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting marketing and export and import of drug and biological products such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines generally before a new drug or biologic can be marketed considerable data demonstrating its quality safety and efficacy must be obtained organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority 

us drug and biological product development 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdca and its implementing regulations and biologics under the fdca the public health service act or phsa and their implementing regulations both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal state and local statutes and regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions these sanctions could include among other actions the fda’s refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval license revocation a clinical hold untitled or warning letters voluntary or mandatory product recalls market withdrawals product seizures total or partial 

suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines must be approved by the fda through a biologics license application or bla or new drug application nda process before they may be legally marketed in the united states the process generally involves the following 

• completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations including studies conducted in accordance with glp requirements 

• submission to the fda of an ind application which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 

• approval by an institutional review board or irb or independent ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated 

• performance of adequate and wellcontrolled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable ind regulations good clinical practice or gcp requirements and other clinical trialrelated regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication 

• submission to the fda of a bla or an nda 

• a determination by the fda within 60 days of its receipt of a bla or an nda to accept the filing for review 

• satisfactory completion of one or more fda preapproval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic or drug will be produced to assess compliance with cgmp requirements to assure that the facilities methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biologic or drug’s identity strength quality and purity 

• potential fda audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the bla or nda 

• payment of user fees for fda review of the bla or nda and 

• fda review and approval of the bla or nda including consideration of the views of any fda advisory committee prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the biologic or drug in the united states 

the preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines will be granted on a timely basis or at all 

preclinical studies 

before testing any biological or drug candidate including our product candidates in humans the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use the conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements including glp regulations for safetytoxicology studies an ind sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests together with manufacturing information analytical data any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies among other things to the fda as part of an ind an ind is a request for authorization from the fda to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin some longterm preclinical testing may continue after the ind is submitted an ind automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold in such a case the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin as a result submission of an ind may not result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence 

clinical trials 

the clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control in accordance with gcp requirements which include the requirement that all patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the clinical trial dosing procedures subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy each protocol and any subsequent amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind furthermore each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an irb for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits the irb also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed there also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries information about certain clinical trials including clinical trial results must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the wwwclinicaltrialsgov website 

in addition to the submission of an ind to the fda before initiation of a clinical trial in the united states certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the recombinant dna advisory committee or rac of the national institutes of health or nih office of biotechnology activities or the oba pursuant to the nih 

guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules or nih guidelines on august 17 2018 the nih issued a notice in the federal register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials including changes to the applicable nih guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the rac with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications during the public comment period which closed october 16 2018 the nih announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the rac to review individual clinical protocols in april 2019 nih announced the updated guidelines which reflect these proposed changes and clarified that these trials will remain subject to the fda’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the nih guidelines specifically under the nih guidelines supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee or ibc a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution the ibc assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial while the nih guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving nih funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the nih guidelines voluntarily follow them 

a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the united states may but need not obtain fda authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an ind if a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an ind the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the fda in support of a bla or nda the fda will accept a welldesigned and wellconducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind if the study was conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the fda is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary 

clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases known as phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 and may overlap 

• phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or diseaseaffected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate the primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism pharmacologic action side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate 

• phase 2 clinical trials generally involve studies in diseaseaffected patients to evaluate proof of concept andor determine the dosing regimens for subsequent investigations at the same time safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted 

• phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use its safety in use and to establish the overall benefitrisk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling 

in august 2018 the fda released a draft guidance entitled “expansion cohorts use in firstinhuman clinical trials to expedite development of oncology drugs and biologics” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development ie the firstinhuman clinical trial to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in ind applications and assessed by fda expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time 

postapproval trials sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval these trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting in certain instances the fda may mandate the performance of phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a bla or nda 

progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials among other information must be submitted at least annually to the fda and written ind safety reports must be submitted to the fda and the investigators 15 calendar days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure the sponsor also must notify the fda of any unexpected fatal or lifethreatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information 

phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period if at all the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients additionally some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor known as a data safety monitoring board or committee this group provides 

authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial concurrent with clinical trials companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and among other things companies must develop methods for testing the identity strength quality and purity of the final product additionally appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life 

fda review process 

following completion of the clinical trials data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the fda as part of a bla or nda along with proposed labeling chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data a bla is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety purity and potency an nda for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy the marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings data may come from companysponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources including studies initiated by investigators to support marketing approval the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the fda fda approval of a bla or nda must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the united states 

under the prescription drug user fee act or pdufa as amended each bla or nda must be accompanied by a user fee the fda adjusts the pdufa user fees on an annual basis fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business additionally no user fees are assessed on blas or ndas for products designated as orphan drugs unless the product also includes a nonorphan indication 

the fda reviews all submitted blas and ndas before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the bla or nda for filing the fda must make a decision on accepting a bla or nda for filing within 60 days of receipt and such decision could include a refusal to file by the fda once the submission is accepted for filing the fda begins an indepth review of the bla or nda under the goals and policies agreed to by the fda under pdufa the fda has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original bla or nda for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant and six months from the filing date of an original bla or nda designated for priority review the fda does not always meet its pdufa goal dates for standard and priority blas and ndas and the review process is often extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 

before approving a bla or nda the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cgmp requirements the fda will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cgmp requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications 

the fda also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with gcp requirements additionally the fda may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions if any the fda is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval the fda likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data which could result in extensive discussions between the fda and the applicant during the review process after the fda evaluates a bla or nda it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic or drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications a complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form a complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the bla or nda identified by the fda the complete response letter may require additional clinical data additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trials andor other significant and timeconsuming requirements related to clinical trials preclinical studies or manufacturing if a complete response letter is issued the applicant may either resubmit the bla or nda addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing even if such data and information are submitted the fda may decide that the bla or nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data 

orphan drug designation 

under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200000 individuals in the united states or more than 200000 individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the united states for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product 

orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a bla or nda after the fda grants orphan drug designation the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 

if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues competitors however may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication in the latter case because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for offlabel uses the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same drug and same indication as defined by the fda for which we are seeking approval or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease if we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity orphan drug status in the european union or eu has similar but not identical requirements and benefits 

expedited development and review programs 

the fda has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria specifically new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied the sponsor can request the fda to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving bla or nda approval but ideally no later than the prebla or prenda meeting any product submitted to the fda for marketing including under a fast track program may be eligible for other types of fda programs intended to expedite development and review such as priority review and accelerated approval any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies the fda will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review 

a product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies in addition it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality or imm that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on imm or other clinical benefit as a condition of approval the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and wellcontrolled postmarketing clinical trials if the fda concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted it will require such postmarketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product if the fda determines that the conditions of approval are not being met the fda can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic 

additionally a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation plus intensive guidance from the fda to ensure an efficient drug development program 

even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs the fda may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for fda review or approval may not be shortened furthermore fast track designation priority review accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process 

emergency use authorization eua 

the secretary of health and human services may authorize unapproved medical products including vaccines to be marketed in the context of an actual or potential emergency that has been designated by the us government the covid19 pandemic has been designated as such a national emergency after an emergency has been announced the secretary of health and human services may authorize the issuance of and the fda commissioner may issue euas for the use of specific products based on criteria established by the fdca including that the product at issue may be effective in diagnosing treating or preventing serious or lifethreatening diseases when there are no adequate approved and available alternatives an eua is subject to additional conditions and restrictions and is productspecific an eua terminates when the emergency determination underlying the eua terminates an eua is not a longterm alternative to obtaining fda approval licensure or clearance for a product fda may revoke an eua for a variety of 

reasons including where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization so it is not possible to predict how long an eua may remain in place 

pediatric information 

under the pediatric research equity act as amended a bla or nda or supplement to a bla or nda must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective the fda may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient new indication new dosage form new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial pediatric study plan or psp within 60 days of an endofphase 2 meeting or if there is no such meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 23 study the initial psp must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct including study objectives and design age groups relevant endpoints and statistical approach or a justification for not including such detailed information and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information the fda and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the psp a sponsor can submit amendments to an agreedupon initial psp at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies early phase clinical trials andor other clinical development programs 

postmarketing requirements 

following approval of a new product the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including among other things monitoring and recordkeeping activities reporting of adverse experiences complying with promotion and advertising requirements which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations known as ‘‘offlabel use’’ and limitations on industrysponsored scientific and educational activities although physicians may prescribe legally available products for offlabel uses manufacturers may not market or promote such uses prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the fda in conjunction with their first use further if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic including changes in indications labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities the applicant may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new bla or nda or bla or nda supplement which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials 

the fda may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems to assure the safe use of the product if the fda concludes a rems is needed the sponsor of the bla or nda must submit a proposed rems the fda will not approve the bla or nda without an approved rems if required a rems could include medication guides physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use such as restricted distribution methods patient registries and other risk minimization tools any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion distribution prescription or dispensing of products newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures including a rems or the conduct of postmarketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue product approvals may be withdrawn for noncompliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 

fda regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cgmp regulations in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of certain clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cgmp regulations we and these manufacturers must comply with cgmp regulations that require among other things quality control and quality assurance the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cgmp manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp requirements and other laws accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance the discovery of violative conditions including failure to conform to cgmp regulations could result in enforcement actions and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product manufacturer or holder of an approved bla or nda including recall 

us patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 

depending upon the timing duration and specifics of fda approval of our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent 

term restoration act of 1984 commonly referred to as the hatch waxman amendments the hatch waxman amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and fda regulatory review process patent term restoration however cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of a bla or nda plus the time between the submission date of a bla or nda and the approval of that application except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent the uspto in consultation with the fda reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in the future we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the current expiration date depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant bla or nda 

marketing exclusivity provisions under the fdca can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications the fdca provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an nda or supplement to an existing nda if new clinical investigations other than bioavailability studies that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the fda to be essential to the approval of the application for example for new indications dosages or strengths of an existing drug this threeyear exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the fda from approving abbreviated new drug applications or andas for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use the fdca also provides a fiveyear period of nonpatent marketing exclusivity within the united states to the first applicant to obtain approval of an nda for a new chemical entity a drug is a new chemical entity if the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance 

during the exclusivity period the fda may not accept for review an anda or a 505b2 nda submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval however an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement to one of the patents listed with the fda by the innovator nda holder threeyear and fiveyear exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full nda however an applicant submitting a full nda would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy 

an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdalicensed reference biological product was created by the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 or bpci act this amendment to the phsa in part attempts to minimize duplicative testing biosimilarity which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety purity and potency can be shown through analytical studies animal studies and a clinical trial or trials interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and for products administered multiple times to an individual that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch 

a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the fda will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product ‘‘first licensure’’ typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the united states date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of and a new period of exclusivity is not available for a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product or licensor predecessor in interest or other related entity for a change not including a modification to the structure of the biological product that results in a new indication route of administration dosing schedule dosage form delivery system delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety purity or potency 

pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the united states pediatric exclusivity if granted adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods this six month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an fda issued ‘‘written request’’ for such a trial 

european union drug development 

in the eu our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements as in the united states medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained 

similar to the united states the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the european union are subject to significant regulatory controls although the eu clinical trials directive 200120ec has sought to harmonize the eu clinical trials regulatory framework setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the eu the eu member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the directive differently this has led to significant variations in the member state regimes under the current regime before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the eu countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies the national competent authority or nca and one or more ethics committees or ecs under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the nca and ecs of the member state where they occurred 

the eu clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization simplifying adverse event reporting procedures improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency in april 2014 the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation eu no 5362014 which is set to replace the current clinical trials directive 200120ec it is expected that the new clinical trials regulation eu no 5362014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the clinical trials information system ctis the centralized eu portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation through an independent audit currently expected to occur in december 2021 it will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical studies in the eu specifically the new regulation which will be directly applicable in all member states and so does not require national implementing legislation in each member state aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the eu for instance the new regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications 

pediatric investigation plan 

an application for marketing authorization of a medicinal product for human use which is not yet authorized in the eu shall be considered valid only if it includes a pediatric investigational plan or pip according to regulation ec no 19012006 unless a waiver applies eg because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults the pip or the application for waiver shall be submitted with a request for agreement except in duly justified cases early during the product development phase and not later than upon completion of the human pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects the end of phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies can coincide with the initial tolerability studies or the initiation of the adult phase 2 studies proofofconcept studies in any case submission of the pip cannot be after initiation of pivotal trials or confirmatory phase 3 trials 

the pediatric committee a scientific committee established at the community level shall assess the content of any pip waivers and deferrals for a medicinal product submitted to it in accordance with the regulation on medicinal products for pediatric use and formulate an opinion thereon 

european drug review and approval 

in the european economic area or eea which is comprised of the 27 member states of the eu and norway iceland and liechtenstein medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization or ma there are two types of marketing authorizations 

the community ma is issued by the european commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the committee for medicinal products for human use or chmp of the ema and is valid throughout the entire territory of the eea the centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as biotechnology medicinal products orphan medicinal products advanced therapy medicines such as gene therapy somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of hiv aids cancer neurodegenerative disorders diabetes autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases for those products for which the use of the centralized procedure is not mandatory applicants may elect to use the centralized procedure where either the product contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the eea or where the applicant can show that the product constitutes a significant therapeutic scientific or technical innovation or for which the centralized procedure is in the interest of patients at a european level 

national marketing authorizations which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the eea and only cover their respective territory are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the eea this national marketing authorization can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure if the product has not received a national marketing authorization in any member state at the time of application it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the 

decentralized procedure under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the marketing authorization is sought one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state or rms the competent authority of the rms prepares a draft assessment report a draft summary of the product characteristics or spc and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet which are sent to the other member states referred to as the concerned member states for their approval if the concerned member states raise no objections based on a potential serious risk to public health in relation to the assessment spc labeling or packaging proposed by the rms the product is subsequently granted a national marketing authorization in all the member states ie in the rms and the concerned member states 

under the above described procedures before granting the marketing authorization the ema or the competent authorities of the member states of the eea make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality safety and efficacy 

now that the uk which comprises great britain and northern ireland has left the european union great britain will no longer be covered by centralized mas under the northern irish protocol centralized marketing authorizations will continue to be recognized in northern ireland all medicinal products with a current centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to great britain mas on january 1 2021 for a period of two years from january 1 2021 the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency or mhra the uk medicines regulator may rely on a decision taken by the european commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure in order to more quickly grant a new great britain ma a separate application will however still be required 

european exclusivity 

in the eea new innovative products authorized for marketing ie reference products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon the grant of a marketing authorization during the period of data exclusivity generic or biosimilar applicants may not reference the innovator’s preclinical or clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization for a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the eea during the additional twoyear period of market exclusivity a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization application can be submitted and the innovator’s data may be referenced but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period the overall 10year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if during the first eight years of those 10 years the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained a marketing authorization based on an application with a completely independent data package of pharmaceutical tests preclinical tests and clinical trials 

european orphan designation and exclusivity 

in the eea the ema’s committee for orphan medicinal products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10000 persons in the eu community or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment in its development and in each case for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis prevention or treatment has been authorized or if a method exists the product would be a significant benefit to those affected 

in the eea orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval this period may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity during the period of market exclusivity marketing authorization may only be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same therapeutic indication if i a second applicant can establish that its product although similar to the authorized product is safer more effective or otherwise clinically superior ii the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application or iii the marketing authorization holder for the authorized product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 

european data collection 

the collection and use of personal health data in the eu is governed by the provisions of the data protection directive and as of may 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr this directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data the data protection directive and gdpr also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu to the united states failure to comply with the requirements of the data protection directive the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties the gdpr introduces new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

european union drug marketing 

much like the antikickback statute prohibition in the united states the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the eu infringement of relevant eu laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment 

payments may be made to physicians in limited circumstances and in certain eu member states such payments must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians for the provision of services often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization andor the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

brexit and the regulatory framework in the united kingdom 

on june 23 2016 the electorate in the uk voted in favor of leaving the eu commonly referred to as brexit thereafter on march 29 2017 the country formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw pursuant to article 50 of the lisbon treaty the uk formally left the eu on january 31 2020 a transition period began on february 1 2020 during which eu pharmaceutical law remained applicable to the uk however this ended on december 31 2020 since the regulatory framework in the uk covering quality safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products clinical trials marketing authorization commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from eu directives and regulations brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the uk as uk legislation now has the potential to diverge from eu legislation it remains to be seen how brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the uk in the longterm the mhra has recently published detailed guidance for industry and organizations to follow from january 1 2021 now the transition period is over which will be updated as the uk’s regulatory position on medicinal products evolves over time 

rest of the world regulation 

for other countries outside of the eu and the united states such as countries in eastern europe latin america middle east or asia the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country additionally the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the declaration of helsinki 

if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements we may be subject to among other things fines suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals product recalls seizure of products operating restrictions or criminal prosecution 

other healthcare laws 

healthcare providers physicians and third party payors including governmental payors such as medicare and medicaidwill play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval our future arrangements with third party payors healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval in the united states these laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback false claims physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations including but not limited to those described below 

• the antikickback statute or aks makes it illegal for any person including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf to knowingly and willfully solicit receive offer or pay any remuneration directly or indirectly in cash or in kind that is intended to induce or reward referrals including the purchase recommendation order or prescription of a particular drug or any other good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as medicare or medicaid violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison criminal fines administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs in addition a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it 

• the federal false claims act imposes civil penalties including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities including manufacturers for among other things knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal healthcare program or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government the government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by for example providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product offlabel claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the false claims act our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products the reporting of prices used to calculate medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal state and thirdparty reimbursement for our products and the sale and marketing of our product and any future investigational medicines are subject to scrutiny under this law 

• health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa imposes criminal and civil liability for among other things knowingly and willfully executing a scheme or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program including private payors or falsifying concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation 

• hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech and their respective implementing regulations impose among other things specified requirements on covered entities and their business associates relating to the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information including mandatory contractual terms and required implementation of technical safeguards of such information hitech also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties amended hipaa to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal hipaa laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions 

• the physician payments sunshine act enacted as part of the patient protection and affordable care act the aca imposed new annual reporting requirements for certain manufacturers of drugs devices biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under medicare medicaid or the children’s health insurance program for certain payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members effective january 1 2022 these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain nonphysician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners 

• analogous state and foreign fraud and abuse laws and regulations such as state antikickback and false claims laws which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of payor impose a variety of obligations on such laws are enforced by various state agencies and through private actions some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant federal government compliance guidance require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers and restrict marketing practices or require disclosure of marketing expenditures state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances such data privacy and security laws may differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by hipaa thus complicating compliance efforts for example in california the california consumer protection act ccpa which went into effect on january 1 2020 establishes a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the state of california imposing special rules on the 

collection of consumer data from minors and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the ccpa and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches further a new california privacy law the california privacy rights act cpra was passed by california voters on november 3 2020 the cpra will create additional obligations with respect to processing and storing personal information that are scheduled to take effect on january 1 2023 with certain provisions having retroactive effect to january 1 2022 while clinical trial data and information governed by hipaa are currently exempt from the current versions of the ccpa and cpra other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the ccpa and cpra may broaden its scope 

the scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us we may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines imprisonment disgorgement exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid reputational harm additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to similar actions penalties and sanctions ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities can be time and resourceconsuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business 

current and future healthcare reform legislation 

in the united states and foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any investigational medicines for which we obtain marketing approval the aca for example contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lowercost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by medicaid programs extension of medicaid rebates to medicaid managed care plans mandatory discounts for certain medicare part d beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs we expect that current laws as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or any strategic collaborators may receive for any approved products 

since its enactment there have been numerous judicial administrative executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future for example various portions of the aca are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the united states supreme court and the trump administration issued various executive orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices additionally congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the aca it is unclear whether the aca will be overturned or further amended particularly given the new administration we cannot predict what effect further changes to the aca would have on our business 

additionally other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted 

• the budget control act of 2011 among other things created measures for spending reductions by congress a joint select committee on deficit reduction tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 was unable to reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs these changes included aggregate reductions to medicare payments to providers of up to 2 per fiscal year which went into effect in april 2013 and will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken pursuant to the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act also known as the cares act as well as subsequent legislation these reductions have been suspended from may 1 2020 through march 31 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic proposed legislation if passed would extend this suspension until the end of the pandemic 

• the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 among other things reduced medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years 

further there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which have resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products in addition the federal government state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs including pricecontrols restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs for example the federal government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs additionally the previous administration released a “blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers while any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs 

individual states in the united states have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

packaging and distribution in the united states 

if our products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration additional laws and requirements apply products must meet applicable childresistant packaging requirements under the us poison prevention packaging act manufacturing sales promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 

the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations including extensive recordkeeping licensing storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products 

the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action depending on the circumstances failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution fines or other penalties injunctions exclusion from federal healthcare programs requests for recall seizure of products total or partial suspension of production denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts including government contracts any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way 

changes in regulations statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring for example i changes to our manufacturing arrangements ii additions or modifications to product labeling iii the recall or discontinuation of our products or iv additional recordkeeping requirements if any such changes were to be imposed they could adversely affect the operation of our business 

other us environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we may be subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes from time to time and in the future our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials and may also produce hazardous waste products even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities however we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us 

in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts in addition failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions

while we have received emergency use authorization from the us food and drug administration and other provisional interim or conditional authorizations from regulatory authorities outside the united states for our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 we may encounter difficulties producing or successfully commercializing the vaccine consistent with our existing or potential contractual obligations 

in response to the global pandemic caused by sarscov2 we are pursuing the rapid manufacture and continued clinical testing of our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 while we have received an emergency use authorization eua from the us fda and other authorizations for the distribution of our covid19 vaccine from regulatory authorities outside the united states including canada the uk the eu switzerland qatar israel and singapore we may encounter difficulties producing the vaccine on the timelines and in the quantities set forth in our existing supply agreements and those potential difficulties could also prevent us from successfully signing or performing under future supply agreements for the covid19 vaccine our ability to commercialize an effective vaccine depends on the success of our manufacturing capability both at our own manufacturing facility and those of our manufacturing partners which we rapidly scaled in response to the pandemic and in parallel with our development and clinical testing of our vaccine we are also committing substantial financial resources and personnel to the development manufacture and distribution of our covid19 vaccine including to support the scaleup of manufacturing to enable our pandemic response which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of covid19 as a global health concern our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources—including managerial and financial resources—to a global health threat against which our vaccine may not be fully effective and may ultimately prove unsuccessful or unprofitable furthermore notwithstanding our entry into supply agreements for the covid19 vaccine with the us and foreign governments there are no assurances that our vaccine will be approved for distribution and commercial use in all countries covered by such supply agreements 

although we have a dedicated manufacturing facility we do not have sufficient manufacturing infrastructure to support a global rollout of the covid19 vaccine on our own for example we have entered into a strategic collaboration with lonza ltd to enable increased production of our covid19 vaccine we have also entered into a collaboration with catalent inc for largescale commercial fillfinish manufacturing of our covid19 vaccine in the united states and a collaboration with laboratorios farmacéuticos rovi sa or rovi and recipharm for largescale commercial fillfinish manufacturing of mrna1273 for supply to markets outside of the us from rovi’s facilities in spain and recipharm’s facilities in france we have engaged other collaborators and may need to engage others in the future including contract manufacturing organizations government and nongovernment organizations and other funding and manufacturing sources to assist in meeting our capacity needs in support of our global rollout prior to 2020 we have not previously ramped our organization for a commercial launch of any product and doing so in a pandemic environment with an urgent critical global need creates additional challenges such as distribution channels intellectual property disputes or challenges and the need to establish teams of people with the relevant skills worldwide we may also face challenges with sourcing a sufficient amount of raw materials to support the demand for our covid19 vaccine we may be unable to effectively create a supply chain for the vaccine that will adequately support demand as we are reliant on our thirdparty collaborators being able to fulfill demand any capacity issues or delays experienced by any of our thirdparty collaborators may result in us not being able to meet certain product volume or delivery timing obligations under our supply agreements for the covid19 vaccine furthermore we will encounter significant additional capital requirements as we continue to expand our commercial launch efforts while our collaboration with barda and revenue from customer contracts will help us meet these capital requirements additional investment whether from our own capital resources or through collaborations with others will be necessary we cannot guarantee that any of these new challenges and requirements will be met in a timely manner or at all 

in addition another party may ultimately be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine or other treatment for covid19 in particular given the widespread media attention on the current pandemic there are efforts by public and private entities to develop a covid19 vaccine as fast as possible including by astrazeneca glaxosmithklinesanofi johnson  johnson novavax and pfizerbiontech the pfizerbiontech vaccine has also received an eua in the united states and other territories including the eu and uk and other vaccines including the astrazeneca vaccine have been authorized elsewhere 

those other entities may develop covid19 vaccines that as compared to mrna1273 or any other covid19 vaccine that we may develop are more effective become the standard of care have broader market acceptance are safer or have fewer or less severe side effects are more convenient are developed at a lower cost or may be more successfully commercialized many of these other organizations are much larger than we are and have access to larger pools of capital and broader manufacturing infrastructure larger pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for their products and may have the resources to heavily invest to accelerate development and commercialization of their vaccine candidates our business could be materially and adversely affected if competitors develop and commercialize one or more covid19 vaccines before we can fully expand our commercialization capabilities 

the success or failure of other entities or perceived success or failure may adversely impact our ability to obtain any future funding for our covid19 vaccine commercialization effort in addition we may not be able to compete effectively if our product candidates do not satisfy government procurement requirements with respect to biodefense products 

we are devoting significant resources to the scaleup development and commercialization of our covid19 vaccine including for use by the us government and other global governmental and commercial partners 

we continue to work toward the largescale technical development manufacturing scaleup in several countries and larger scale deployment of our covid19 vaccine the number of doses of this vaccine that we are able to produce and distribute is dependent on our ability and the ability of our contract manufacturers to successfully and rapidly scale up manufacturing capacity to support the scaleup we have expended and will need to continue to expend significant resources and capital we may need to or we may be required by the federal government to divert resources and capital from our other programs we may also seek and secure significant additional funding through contractual arrangements and collaborations with third parties we may be unable to enter into such arrangements on favorable terms or at all which would adversely affect our ability to develop manufacture and distribute the covid19 vaccine 

as part of this effort we have a commitment from barda to fund up to 9549 million to enable the initiation of and support the planning and execution of phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials of mrna1273 under our own ind as well as the scaleup of mrna1273 manufacture in 2020 to enable our pandemic response to the extent our funding collaborators have discretion over the distribution of funding commitments we may not ultimately receive the full amount of committed funds and could be exposed to urgent needs for additional funding to support our manufacturing activities our funding collaborators may also impose restrictions on or mandate input as to our conduct of clinical trials manufacturing activities or distribution activities which may cause delays in the event of disagreement 

we have entered into and plan to continue entering into supply agreements for the covid19 vaccine that include cash deposits from the purchasers in the event we are unable to successfully obtain regulatory authorization or approval for the commercialization of the vaccine in the relevant jurisdictions or we fail to meet certain product volume or delivery timing obligations under our supply agreements we may be required to refund significant portions of the deposits which could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition 

we have already incurred expenses in connection with the distribution of our covid19 vaccine and these expenses could increase over time such expenses include the cost of implementing pharmacovigilance to collect analyze and monitor safety data and to identify and evaluate adverse reactions to our covid19 vaccine as it is administered in jurisdictions around the globe 

in addition since we have received an eua for the covid19 vaccine and have commenced commercialization activities we have a widely used vaccine in circulation in the united states and other countries prior to our receipt of full marketing approval this is also the case in other countries such as the uk where a form of emergency or conditional approval has been granted but not a full marketing approval unexpected safety issues including any that we have not yet observed in our phase 1 2 or 3 clinical trials for the covid19 vaccine could lead to significant reputational damage for moderna and our technology platform going forward and other issues including delays in our other programs the need for redesign of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources 

the positive efficacy and safety data from the ongoing clinical studies of our covid19 vaccine and the eua granted by the fda may not be predictive of the final results of the clinical trials which is one of a number of factors that may delay or prevent us from receiving full regulatory approval of our vaccine 

the positive efficacy and safety data we have announced from the ongoing studies of our covid19 vaccine are based on analyses of those studies to date and while the efficacy assessment is now considered final efficacy effectiveness safety and immunogenicity data continue to accumulate further results from the ongoing studies for mrna1273 as well as the experience of the millions of individuals who have been vaccinated with mrna1273 could show diminished immunogenicity or protection as compared to the 

results released to date as efficacy and antibody persistence may wane over time additionally we may observe new more frequent or adverse events of greater severity in subjects participating in these ongoing clinical studies or among those individuals who have been vaccinated with mrna1273 in addition the interpretation of the data from our clinical trials of mrna1273 by the fda and other regulatory agencies may differ from our interpretation of such data and the fda or other regulatory agencies may require that we conduct additional studies or analyses 

the assays being used to estimate the effectiveness of vaccine candidates being developed to prevent covid19 have only recently been developed and are continuing to evolve validation reports for these assays have been submitted for review to regulatory agencies results obtained in clinical studies of mrna1273 with subsequent versions of these assays may be less positive than the results we have obtained to date moreover the samples of convalescent sera or blood samples from people who have recovered from covid19 used to benchmark the level of antibodies produced by subjects receiving mrna1273 in clinical studies have been taken from a small number of people and may not be representative of the antibody levels in a broader population of people who have recovered from covid19 particularly as variant strains have begun to emerge the future results in clinical studies of mrna1273 may not be as positive when compared to the antibody levels in other samples of convalescent sera various preclinical animal studies of mrna1273 are ongoing including preclinical studies in nonhuman primates if safety data observed in these preclinical studies are inconsistent with safety data from clinical studies we may be required to conduct additional studies of mrna1273 any of these factors could delay or prevent us from receiving regulatory approval of mrna1273 including a biologics license application or bla apart from the eua by the fda in the united states and related authorizations in other jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that mrna1273 will be otherwise approved in a timely manner if at all 

we may be unsuccessful in adapting our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 or developing future versions of our covid19 vaccine to protect against variants of the sarscov2 virus and a market for vaccines against these variants may not develop 

our current covid19 vaccine mrna1273 was developed based upon the genetic sequence of the sarscov2 virus that was first detected in wuhan china as the pandemic has continued the sarscov2 virus continues to evolve and new strains of the virus or those that are already in circulation may prove more transmissible or cause more severe forms of covid19 disease than the predominant strains to date there is a risk that mrna1273 will not be as effective in protecting against variant strains of the sarscov2 virus expressing variants of the spike protein particularly strains with mutations in the receptor binding domain and nterminal domain although we have shown comparable neutralization titers with the majority of variants that we have tested including the b117 strain which was first detected in the united kingdom we did see a 64fold reduction in neutralization titers in the b1351 strain first detected in south africa the ultimate impact to protection against this variant remains unknown but we are actively working to mitigate this risk by beginning nonclinical investigations into the immunogenicity of a modification to mrna1273 designed to reflect the mutations of the b1351 variant however these efforts may be unsuccessful and failure to adapt our vaccine to this or other variants of the sarscov2 virus could lead to significant reputational harm in addition to adversely affecting our financial results it is also possible that we may expend significant resources adapting our covid19 vaccine to protect against variants of the sarscov2 virus but that a market for this adapted vaccine does not develop or demand does not align with our projections or cost expenditures 

the regulatory pathway for mrna1273 is continually evolving and may result in unexpected or unforeseen challenges 

to date our covid19 vaccine has moved rapidly through the fda regulatory review and eua process as well as the review and authorization process in a number of other jurisdictions including the uk and eu the speed at which all parties are acting to create and test many therapeutics and vaccines for covid19 is atypical and evolving or changing plans or priorities within the fda or the regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions including changes based on new knowledge of covid19 and how the disease affects the human body and new variants of the virus may significantly affect the regulatory timeline for further authorizations or approvals for our covid vaccine we cannot anticipate or predict with certainty the timelines or regulatory processes that may be required for the authorization or approval of updated versions of our covid19 vaccine or vaccines that may be developed to fight against variants of the sarscov2 virus 

the fda has the authority to grant an eua to allow unapproved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose treat or prevent serious or lifethreatening diseases or conditions when there are no adequate approved and available alternatives although we have been granted an eua by the fda for our covid19 vaccine specifically mrna1273 the fda may revoke an eua where it is determined that the underlying health emergency no longer exists or warrants such authorization and we cannot predict how long the eua will remain in place such revocation could adversely impact our business in a variety of ways including if mrna1273 is not yet approved by the fda pursuant to a bla as we and our manufacturing partners have invested in the supply chain to provide mrna1273 under the eua 

similarly the european medicines agency ema has granted a conditional marketing authorization for mrna1273 the ema has the authority to grant a conditional marketing authorization in a public health emergency on the basis of less comprehensive clinical data than normally required but where the benefit of immediate availability of the product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that 

additional data are still required a conditional marketing authorization is a formal marketing authorization of the vaccine and covers all batches produced for the eu however we are obliged to provide certain additional information and data by specified timelines as conditions of the authorization and the ema can take regulatory action if we do not comply with such conditions conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year and can be renewed annually however there is a risk that the ema may decide not to renew our conditional authorization if new data emerges that shows the benefits of our vaccine do not continue to outweigh its risks the ema can suspend or revoke our authorization similar authorizations that we have received for mrna1273 including those in the uk and canada are temporary emergency authorizations that could similarly be revoked if the conditions for granting the authorization no longer apply any such revocation of the temporary authorization to distribute mrna1273 without receiving final approval to distribute the vaccine could adversely impact our ability to realize the full financial benefit of our existing or future supply agreements 

our ability to produce a successful vaccine and deliver it to customers may be curtailed by one or more government actions or interventions which may be more likely during a global health crisis such as covid19 

given the significant global impact of the covid19 pandemic it is possible that one or more government entities may take actions that directly or indirectly have the effect of diminishing some of our rights or opportunities with respect to our covid19 vaccine limiting our economic prospects in the us the defense production act of 1950 as amended the “defense production act” gives the us government rights and authorities that may directly or indirectly diminish our own rights or economic opportunities with respect to our covid19 vaccine our current and potential thirdparty service providers may be impacted by government entities potentially invoking the defense production act or other potential restrictions to all or a portion of services they might otherwise offer as of january 21 2021 president biden has stated his intent to use the defense production act to maximize the manufacture of vaccine and vaccine supplies and that this effort will prioritize supplies that could cause bottlenecks including glass vials stoppers syringes needles and the fill and finish capacity to package vaccine into vials 

government entities imposing restrictions or limitations on our thirdparty service providers may require us to obtain alternative service sources for our covid19 vaccine or our vaccine candidates if we are unable to timely enter into alternative arrangements or if such alternative arrangements are not available on satisfactory terms we will experience delays in the development or production of our covid19 vaccine and our vaccine candidates increased expenses and delays in distribution or commercialization of our covid19 vaccine or when and if approved our vaccine candidates 

in addition our supply contracts with the us government for our covid19 vaccine contain certain restrictions on our ability to export vaccine that is produced from our usdedicated supply chain to serve markets outside the us prior to satisfying our delivery obligations to the us government furthermore governments have threatened to block or limit the export of covid19 vaccines manufactured in their territories in instances where the manufacturers have been delayed or have not fully satisfied their delivery obligations to those governments governments of the jurisdictions in which we or our contract manufacturing partners produce our covid19 vaccine may impose export restrictions prohibiting us from delivering orders of our covid19 vaccine to customers in other jurisdictions such restrictions may also delay or prevent production of the vaccine the imposition of export controls could severely and adversely impact our manufacturing activities commercial activities and financial results 

in addition during a global health crisis such as the covid19 pandemic where the spread of a disease needs to be controlle d closed or heavily regulated national borders will create challenges and potential delays in our development and production activities and may necessitate that we pursue strategies to develop and produce our vaccines and vaccine candidates within selfcontained national or internationa l borders at potentially much greater expense and with longer timeframes for public distribution 

certain aspects of our business may be adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic 

the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts our business and operating results will depend in part on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted including new information that may emerge concerning covid19 including potential variants of sarscov2 and the actions taken to contain covid19 or treat its impact among others 

the spread of covid19 has resulted in the delay and interruption of certain of our business operations many of our clinical trials have been affected by the pandemic site initiation participant recruitment and enrollment participant dosing distribution of clinical trial materials study monitoring and data analysis may be paused or delayed or continue to be paused or delayed due to changes in hospital or university policies federal state or local regulations or restrictions prioritization of hospital resources toward pandemic efforts travel restrictions concerns for patient safety in a pandemic environment or other reasons related to the pandemic more specifically as previously disclosed certain of our clinical trials have been adversely affected resulting in paused enrollment or delayed site initiations as covid19 continues to spread some participants and clinical investigators may not be able to comply with clinical trial protocols for example quarantines or other travel limitations whether voluntary or required have been implemented in many countries and may impede participant movement affect sponsor access to study sites or interrupt healthcare services and we may be unable to conduct our clinical trials further if the spread of the covid19 pandemic continues and our operations are adversely impacted including due to facility access restrictions or from an outbreak in a facility we risk manufacturing delays or default andor nonperformance under existing agreements 

infections and deaths related to the pandemic have disrupted and may continue to disrupt the united states’ healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems such disruptions could divert healthcare resources away from or materially delay the review andor approval by the fda and other regulatory agencies with respect to our clinical trials any elongation or deprioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our development candidates 

we currently utilize third parties to among other things manufacture raw materials components parts and consumables perform quality testing and ship our products for example we rely on thirdparty manufacturers such as lonza ltd catalent inc and rovi to enable larger scale manufacture andor fillfinish capabilities for our mrna vaccine mrna1273 against the sarscov2 virus and others such as mckesson for shipping and distribution we also manufacture our development candidates and investigational medicines and perform various services at our manufacturing facility certain of our thirdparty manufacturers and suppliers may pause their operations in response to the covid19 outbreak or otherwise encounter delays in providing their services if either we or any thirdparty manufacturers or third parties in the supply chain for materials used in the production of our covid19 vaccine development candidates or investigational medicines are adversely impacted by restrictions resulting from the covid19 outbreak our supply chain may be disrupted limiting our ability to manufacture our covid19 vaccine as well as investigational medicines for our clinical trials research and development operations and commercialization in addition delays and disruptions experienced by our strategic collaborators due to the covid19 outbreak could adversely impact the ability of such parties to fulfill their obligations which could affect the clinical development or regulatory approvals of development candidates and investigational medicines under joint control 

the spread of covid19 which has caused a broad impact globally including restrictions on travel and quarantine policies put into place by businesses and governments may have a material economic effect on our business including our ability to successfully commercialize our covid19 vaccine due to the pandemic we may have difficulty meeting expectations with respect to commercial sales while the potential economic impact brought by and the duration of the pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict it has already caused and may result in further significant disruption of global financial markets which may reduce our ability to access capital either at all or on favorable terms in addition a recession depression or other sustained adverse market event resulting from the spread of covid19 could materially and adversely affect our business prospects operating results and financial condition and the value of our common stock 

the ultimate impact of the current pandemic or any other health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business our clinical trials our research programs healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole however these effects could have a material impact on our operations and we will continue to monitor the situation closely 

risks related to our business and creating a new class of medicines 

we attempt to distribute our technology biology execution and financing risks across a wide variety of therapeutic areas disease states programs and technologies however our assessment of and approach to risk may not be comprehensive or effectively avoid delays or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities failures in one or more of our programs or modalities could adversely impact other programs or modalities in our pipeline and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and ability to fund our business 

we are creating a new class of medicines based on mrna to improve the lives of patients from the beginning we designed our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mrna over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases we have made investments in our platform infrastructure and clinical capabilities that have enabled us to establish a large pipeline of development candidates of which many are in clinical trials or have an open ind as our development candidates and investigational medicines progress we or others may determine that certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient we made platform level technology mistakes individual programs or our mrna science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or underappreciated our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will result in an inability to manufacture our investigational medicines for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing or we have allocated resources in such a way that large investments are not recovered and capital allocation is not subject to rapid redirection all of these risks may relate to our current and future programs sharing similar science including mrna science and infrastructure and in the event material decisions in any of these areas turn out to have been incorrect or underoptimized we may experience a material adverse impact on our business and ability to fund our operations and we may never realize what we believe is the potential of mrna 

mrna drugs have only been authorized for emergency or other provisional or conditional use for covid19 and there is no guarantee that any other mrna drug will be granted an eua or will be granted full approval in the future as a result of efforts by others or us mrna drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel nature of this new class of medicines 

other than the eua and other similar authorizations for covid19 vaccines no mrna medicines have been granted eua or have been granted full approval to date by the fda or other regulatory agencies successful discovery and development of other mrna medicines by us or our strategic collaborators is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors many of which are beyond our or their control we have made and will continue to make a series of business decisions and take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline including those related to mrna technology delivery technology and manufacturing processes which may be shown to be incorrect based on further work by us our strategic collaborators or others although we have received an eua from the fda for mrna1273 there may never be products in which mrna is the primary active ingredient approved outside the context of authorization for emergency use our mrna investigational medicines that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance experience delays in the clinic experience clinical holds or fail to reach the market for many reasons including 

• discovery efforts at identifying potential mrna medicines may not be successful 

• nonclinical or preclinical study results may show potential mrna medicines to be less effective than desired or to have harmful or problematic side effects 

• clinical trial results may show potential mrna medicines to be less effective than expected eg a clinical trial could fail to meet one or more endpoints or to have unacceptable side effects or toxicities 

• adverse effects in any one of our clinical programs or adverse effects relating to our mrna or our lnps may lead to delays in or termination of one or more of our programs 

• the insufficient ability of our translational models to reduce risk or predict outcomes in humans particularly given that each component of our investigational medicines and development candidates may have a dependent or independent effect on safety tolerability and efficacy which may among other things be speciesdependent 

• manufacturing failures or insufficient supply of cgmp materials for clinical trials or higher than expected cost could delay or set back clinical trials or make mrnabased medicines commercially unattractive 

• our improvements in the manufacturing processes for this new class of medicines and potential medicines may not be sufficient to satisfy the clinical or commercial demand of our investigational medicines or regulatory requirements for clinical trials 

• changes that we make to optimize our manufacturing testing or formulating of cgmp materials could impact the safety tolerability and efficacy of our investigational medicines and development candidates 

• pricing or reimbursement issues or other factors that delay clinical trials or make any mrna medicine uneconomical or noncompetitive with other therapies 

• failure to timely advance our programs or receive the necessary regulatory approvals or a delay in receiving such approvals due to among other reasons slow or failure to complete enrollment in clinical trials withdrawal by trial participants from trials failure to achieve trial endpoints additional time requirements for data analysis data integrity issues preparation of a bla or the equivalent application discussions with the fda or ema a regulatory request for additional nonclinical or clinical data or safety formulation or manufacturing issues may lead to our inability to obtain sufficient funding and 

• the proprietary rights of others and their competing products and technologies that may prevent our mrna medicines from being commercialized 

currently mrna is considered a gene therapy product by the fda unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell dna and could act as a source of side effects mrnabased medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell dna however side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mrna medicines despite the differences in mechanism in addition because no product in which mrna is the primary active ingredient has been approved outside the context of authorization for emergency use the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain the number and design of the clinical trials and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established may be different from those required for gene therapy products or may require safety testing like gene therapy products moreover the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next and may be difficult to predict 

our business is highly dependent on the clinical advancement of our programs and modalities delay or failure to advance programs or modalities could adversely impact our business 

using our platform we are developing product features for medicines based on mrna over time our platform work led to commonalities where a specific combination of mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes generated a set of product features shared by multiple programs this is what we call a “modality” we have historically utilized and expect to continue to utilize earlier programs in a modality to understand the technology risks within the modality including manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties even if our earlier programs in a modality are successful in any phase of development any of such earlier programs may fail at a later phase of development and other programs within the same modality may still fail at any phase of development including at phases where earlier programs in that modality were successful this may be a result of technical challenges unique to that program or due to biology risk which is unique to every program as we progress our programs through clinical development there may be new technical challenges that arise that cause an entire modality to fail 

while we aim to segregate risk using modalities there may be foreseen and unforeseen risks across modalities in whole or in part these include but are not limited to mrna chemical modifications and lnps and their components in addition if any one or more of our clinical programs encounter safety tolerability or efficacy problems developmental delays regulatory issues or other problems our platform approach and business could be significantly harmed we may believe that a particular modality has been derisked but later determine that new and different risks exist with respect to such modality 

in addition the biology risk across the majority of our pipeline represents targets and pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs while we believe we have made progress in seeking to reduce biology risk in certain settings such as for vaccine targets for which we and others have shown the utility of neutralizing antibodies the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across the majority of our current and future programs 

while we attempt to diversify our risks by developing one or more programs in each modality there are risks that are unique to each modality and risks that are applicable across modalities these risks may impair our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development obtain regulatory approval or ultimately commercialize our programs or cause us to experience significant delays in doing so any of which may materially harm our business 

certain features in our development candidates and investigational medicines including those related to mrna chemical modifications surface chemistries lnps and their components may result in foreseen and unforeseen risks that are active across some or all of our modalities any such portfolio spanning risks whether known or unknown if realized in any one of our programs would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our business as a whole 

there are specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and our programs as a whole for example prophylactic vaccines typically require clinical testing in thousands to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefitrisk profile the need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even spurious safety findings negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch while we believe that certain safety tolerability and levels of immunogenicity we have observed in the clinical trials in our prophylactic vaccine programs are sufficient to initiate additional trials there can be no assurance that we will observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in laterstage trials required for approval of these programs for neoantigen cancer vaccines to date no molecular noncellbased therapeutic protein vaccine has been shown to be effective against cancer and there are many clinical and manufacturing challenges to personalized medicines including cellbased therapies and vaccines these risks include a rapid production turnaround time that is measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors the significant costs incurred in making individualized vaccines and potential lack of immune responses potentially due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient these and other risks apply to our pcv and other neoepitope investigational medicine programs additionally there may be challenges in delivering an adequate quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient api required to drive efficacy due to the limitation in volume of api that can be delivered to a specific location like a tumor or injured tissue our therapies for local injections often require specialized skills for conducting a clinical trial that could delay trials or slow or impair commercialization of an approved investigational medicine due to the poor adoption of injected local therapeutics or intratumoral therapies in addition the uncertain translatability of target selection from preclinical animal models including mouse and nonhuman primate models to successful clinical trial results may be impossible particularly for immunooncology and systemic therapies and cancer vaccines in general several biological steps are required for delivery of mrna to translate into therapeutically active medicines these processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues and this could lead to variable levels of therapeutic protein variable activity immunogenicity or variable distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect gene therapies and mrnabased medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product eg the mrna or the delivery vehicle such as an lnp as well as against the encoded protein giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a side effect these risks apply to all of our programs including our systemic secreted therapeutics and systemic intracellular therapeutics modalities 

risks related to our finances 

we have incurred significant losses since our inception and we may incur significant losses again in the future  

we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 2009 including net losses of 7471 million 5140 million and 3847 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as of december 31 2020 we had an accumulated deficit of 224 billion although we had entered into advance purchase agreements for the supply of our covid19 vaccine totaling 117 billion for deliveries scheduled for 2021 as of december 31 2020 we may ultimately be unsuccessful in delivering under these agreements or those that we have subsequently enter into and we may continue to recognize a loss in 2021 or in future years 

we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development including our clinical and preclinical development activities and the development of our platform to date we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and proceeds from strategic alliances and through grants from governmental and private organizations and more recently through upfront payments from the supply agreements that have been invested into the manufacture development and commercialization of our covid19 vaccine the amount of our future net losses if any will depend upon whether we can successfully commercialize our covid19 vaccine and deliver on existing and future supply agreements as well as the rate of our future expenditures to the extent we are unsuccessful in commercializing our products including our covid19 vaccine our access to financing and liquidity will likely depend upon our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings sales of assets strategic alliances or additional grants other than with respect to our covid19 vaccine we have not commenced or completed pivotal clinical trials for any of our programs in clinical trials which means that for most of our investigational medicines it may be several years if ever before we or our strategic collaborators have a product ready for commercialization even if we obtain regulatory approval to market an investigational medicine our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our investigational medicines have received approval and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance reimbursement from thirdparty payors and adequate market share in those markets in addition under certain of our supply agreements for the covid19 vaccine we rely on our customers to pay us portions of the purchase price upon the achievement of certain regulatory or performance milestones 

in the event that such milestones are never achieved our customers could terminate their agreements with us and we may not receive such regulatory or performance milestone payments if we do not receive such milestone payments our business may be materially harmed 

we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and could recognize significant operating losses in future periods we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we 

• continue or expand our research or development of our programs in preclinical development 

• continue or expand the scope of our mrna clinical trials for our investigational medicines 

• initiate additional preclinical clinical or other studies for our development candidates and investigational medicines including under our strategic alliance agreements 

• continue to invest in our platform to conduct research to identify novel mrna technology improvements including identifying novel methods of mrna delivery such as lnps that improve distribution and uptake of mrna to specific tissues 

• change or add to internal manufacturing capacity or capability 

• change or add additional manufacturers or suppliers 

• add additional infrastructure to our quality control and quality assurance groups to support our operations as we progress our investigational medicines toward commercialization 

• attract and retain skilled personnel particularly in cambridge and norwood massachusetts basel switzerland and in other global regions where we have established and may continue to establish operations

• maintain protect and expand our ip portfolio and 

• experience any delays or encounter issues with any of the above 

we have a limited history of recognizing revenue from product sales and may not be able to achieve or maintain longterm sustainable profitability 

our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability alone or with strategic collaborators to successfully complete the development of and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our products and investigational medicines including our commercialization of our covid19 vaccine our ability to recognize revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in 

• manufacturing and delivering supply of our covid19 vaccine and any boosters developed in connection with variants if any in accordance with contractual terms 

• completing research preclinical and clinical development of our development candidates and investigational medicines 

• seeking and obtaining us and foreign marketing approvals for investigational medicines for which we complete clinical trials 

• developing a sustainable stable consistent and transferable manufacturing process or processes for our development candidates and investigational medicines 

• developing a sustainable scalable consistent time sensitive and transferable manufacturing process for our personalized cancer vaccine investigational medicine 

• furthering the development of our own manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing relationships with third parties in order to provide adequate in amount and quality products and services to support clinical development and the market demand for our investigational medicines if approved 

• obtaining market acceptance of our investigational medicines as a treatment option 

• launching and commercializing investigational medicines for which we obtain marketing approval and reimbursement either by collaborating with a strategic collaborator or if launched independently by establishing a sales force marketing and distribution infrastructure 

• addressing any competing technological and market developments 

• implementing additional internal systems and infrastructure 

• negotiating favorable terms in any collaboration licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 

• maintaining defending protecting and expanding our portfolio of ip rights including patents trade secrets and knowhow and 

• attracting hiring and retaining qualified personnel 

we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine and even if one or more of the other investigational medicines that we are developing is approved for commercial sale we anticipate incurring significant costs associated the commercialization of any such approved investigational medicine our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the fda the ema or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical and other studies or make changes to our manufacturing or quality systems in addition to those that we currently anticipate even though we have begun to generate revenues from the sale of our covid19 vaccine we may not be able to achieve or maintain longterm sustainable profitability and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations 

our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our financing or funding ability as well as negatively impact our ability to exist as a standalone company 

our financial condition and operating results have varied in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear in the future due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 

• our ability to manufacture and deliver supply of our covid19 vaccine 

• delays or failures in advancement of existing or future development candidates into the clinic or investigational medicines in clinical trials 

• the feasibility of developing manufacturing and commercializing our programs 

• our ability to manage our growth 

• the outcomes of research programs clinical trials or other product development or approval processes conducted by us and our strategic collaborators 

• our ability to develop or successfully commercialize mrna medicines 

• the ability of our strategic collaborators to develop and successfully commercialize mrna medicines or other products developed from our ip 

• our relationships and any associated exclusivity terms with strategic collaborators 

• our contractual or other obligations to provide resources to fund our development candidates and investigational medicines and to provide resources to our strategic collaborators or to the strategic alliances themselves 

• our operation in a net loss position for the foreseeable future  

• risks associated with the international aspects of our business including the conduct of clinical trials in multiple locations and potential commercialization in such locations 

• our ability to consistently manufacture our development candidates and investigational medicines 

• risks associated with committing financial resources and personnel to the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine including to support a scaleup of manufacturing to enable a pandemic response 

• our ability to accurately report our financial results in a timely manner 

• our dependence on and the need to attract and retain key management and other personnel 

• our ability to obtain protect and enforce our ip rights 

• our ability to prevent the theft or misappropriation of our ip knowhow or technologies 

• advantages that our competitors and potential competitors may have in securing funding obtaining the rights to critical ip or developing competing technologies or products 

• our ability to obtain additional capital that may be necessary to expand our business 

• our strategic collaborators’ ability to obtain additional capital that may be necessary to develop and commercialize products under our strategic alliance agreements 

• business interruptions such as power outages strikes acts of terrorism or natural disasters and 

• the ultimate impact of the covid19 pandemic or any other health epidemic on our business our clinical trials our research programs healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole 

due to the various factors mentioned herein and others the results of any of our prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 

our financial results may fluctuate significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear such that a periodtoperiod comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance in any particular quarter or quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline we do not control the timing of disclosure of any such milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators any disclosure by our strategic collaborators or competitors of data or other events that are perceived as negative whether or not such data are related to other data that we or others release may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or overall valuation our stock price may decline as a result of unexpected clinical trial results in one or more of our programs including adverse safety events reported for any of our programs 

if we are unsuccessful in commercializing our covid19 vaccine we may need to seek and secure significant funding through financings or from other sources clinical data or trial execution that creates delays setbacks or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities or the entire pipeline could result in an impaired ability or inability to finance or fund the company in the future 

we are currently advancing our pipeline of 24 development candidates with 13 having entered clinical studies discovering development candidates and developing investigational medicines is expensive and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to i perform basic research perform preclinical studies and conduct clinical trials of our current and future programs ii continue to develop and expand our platform and infrastructure and supply preclinical studies and clinical trials with appropriate grade materials including cgmp materials iii seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines and iv launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval including building our own commercial sales marketing and distribution organization furthermore our ongoing work on our covid19 vaccine including the development of new formulations to respond to variants of the sarscov2 virus will require significant additional investment during 2021 and beyond some of which may not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by our collaborators or through commercial sales 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 525 billion in cash cash equivalents and investments we expect that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months however our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us including with respect to our development manufacturing and commercialization of our covid19 vaccine and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private equity or debt financings structured financings government or other thirdparty funding sales of assets marketing and distribution arrangements other collaborations and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches in any event we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our investigational medicines even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations our spending will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities because the length of time and activities associated with discovery of development candidates and development of our investigational medicines are highly uncertain we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for 

development marketing and commercialization activities our future funding requirements both near and long term will depend on many factors including but not limited to 

• the initiation progress timing costs and results of preclinical or nonclinical studies and clinical trials for our development candidates and investigational medicines 

• the results of research and our other platform activities 

• the clinical development plans we establish for our investigational medicines 

• the terms of any agreements with our current or future strategic collaborators 

• the number and characteristics of development candidates and investigational medicines that we develop or may inlicense 

• the outcome timing and cost of meeting regulatory requirements established by the fda the ema and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities 

• the cost of filing prosecuting defending and enforcing our patent claims and other ip rights including patent infringement actions brought by third parties against us regarding our investigational medicines or actions by us challenging the patent or ip rights of others 

• the effect of competing technological and market developments including other products that may compete with one or more of our development candidates or investigational medicines 

• the cost and timing of completion and further expansion of clinical and commercial scale manufacturing activities sufficient to support all of our current and future programs whether inhouse or outsourced and 

• the cost of establishing sales marketing and distribution capabilities for any investigational medicines for which we may receive marketing approval and reimbursement in regions where we choose to commercialize our medicines on our own 

we expect to recognize significant revenue in 2021 upon the delivery of our covid19 vaccine pursuant to our supply agreements however at this time we cannot predict whether we will continue to recognize significant revenue in future years based solely on sales of our covid19 vaccine until we can generate sufficient product or royalty revenue to fully finance our operations and longterm strategic plan which we may never do we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of product sales public or private equity or debt offerings structured financings debt financings collaborations strategic alliances sales of assets licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements any fundraising efforts may divert our management from their daytoday activities which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our investigational medicines in addition we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts at the right time on favorable terms or at all negative clinical trial data or setbacks or perceived setbacks in our programs or with respect to our technology could impair our ability to raise additional financing on favorable terms or at all if our commercialization of our covid19 vaccine is unsuccessful there can be no assurance that we will have the funds necessary to meet our existing payment obligations to third parties or be able to raise such funds when needed on terms acceptable to us or at all moreover the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities whether equity or debt by us or the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our shares to decline if we raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect our stockholders’ rights 

further to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock your ownership interest will be diluted if we raise additional capital through debt financings we would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements sales of assets or other collaborations strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our development candidates and investigational medicines technologies future revenue streams or research programs we also could be required to seek strategic collaborators for one or more of our current or future investigational medicines at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our rights to development candidates investigational medicines or ip that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts at the right time on favorable terms or at all we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or investigational medicines or one or more of our other research and development initiatives any of the above events could significantly harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations cause the price of our common stock to decline and negatively impact our ability to fund operations 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 525 billion in cash cash equivalents and investments these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks we may realize losses in the fair value of these investments which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements in addition should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us our interest income would suffer the market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

the amount of and our ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations and uncertainty 

as of december 31 2020 we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 226 billion and 170 billion respectively a portion of which if unused will begin to expire in 2030 and 2032 respectively as of december 31 2020 we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of 733 million and 261 million respectively which if unused begin to expire in 2030 and 2029 respectively we expect to utilize all of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to offset our future income tax liabilities in the taxable year ending december 31 2021 federal net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 generally may not be carried back to prior taxable years and while such federal net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 will not be subject to expiration the deduction for such net operating loss in any taxable year will be limited to 80 of our taxable income in such year where taxable income is determined without regard to the net operating loss deduction itself however the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act repeals the 80 limitation on the utilization of such federal net operating losses for taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and beginning before january 1 2021 and allows for federal net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after december 31 2017 and before january 1 2021 to be carried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the taxable year in which the loss arises this change in law temporarily allowing for the carryback of federal net operating losses is not expected to produce any material benefit for the issuer in general under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses or nols or tax credits or credits including federal research and development tax credits to offset future taxable income or taxes for these purposes an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5 of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period as of december 31 2020 none of our nols or credits will expire due to sections 382 and 383 however future changes in our stock ownership many of which are outside of our control could result in an ownership change under sections 382 and 383 of the internal revenue code and limit our ability to utilize our nols and credits our nols or credits may also be impaired under state law accordingly we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our nols or credits if we undergo an ownership change prior to the utilization of all of such nols or credits in addition the rules regarding timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax purposes in connection with various transactions we have undertaken are complex and uncertain in various respects and could be subject to challenge by taxing authorities in the event any such challenge is sustained our remaining net operating losses could be materially reduced andor we could be determined to be a material cash taxpayer for one or more years 

risks related to the research development regulatory review and approval of our existing and future pipeline 

preclinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially for a new class of medicines such as mrna and therefore our preclinical programs or development candidates may be delayed terminated or may never advance to the clinic any of which may have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

much of our pipeline is in preclinical development and these programs could be delayed or not advance into the clinic before we can initiate clinical trials for a development candidate we must complete extensive preclinical studies including indenabling good laboratory practice glp toxicology testing that support our planned inds in the united states or similar applications in other jurisdictions we must also complete extensive work on chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc activities including yield purity and stability data to be included in the ind submission cmc activities for a new class of medicines such as mrna require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our preclinical or clinical development candidates if we are required to produce new batches of our development candidates due to insufficient shelf life it may delay the commencement or completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials of such development candidates for example we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the fda or other regulatory authorities will accept the results of our preclinical testing or our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical testing studies and cmc activities will ultimately support the further development of our programs as a result we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit inds or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect if at all and we cannot be sure that submission of inds or similar applications will result in the fda or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin 

clinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially with a new class of medicines such as mrna medicines clinical trials of our investigational medicines may be delayed including as a result of the covid19 pandemic or other pandemics in the future and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate any of which could have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

clinical testing is expensive and complex and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain we may not be able to initiate may experience delays in or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators also may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of any clinical trials that we or our strategic collaborators conduct that could delay or prevent us or our strategic collaborators from successfully developing our investigational medicines including 

• the fda other regulators institutional review boards irbs or ethics committees may not authorize us or our investigators to commence a clinical trial or conduct a clinical trial at a prospective trial site for any number of reasons including concerns regarding safety and aspects of the clinical trial design 

• we may experience delays in reaching or fail to reach agreement on favorable terms with prospective trial sites and prospective contract research organizations cros the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different cros and trial sites 

• we have in the past and intend to continue to optimize our manufacturing processes including through changes to the scale and site of manufacturing which may lead to potentially significant changes in our clinical trial designs requiring additional cost and time and as a consequence lead to a delay in plans for progressing one or more investigational medicines 

• the outcome of our preclinical studies and our early clinical trials may not be predictive of the success of later clinical trials and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results 

• we may be unable to establish clinical endpoints that applicable regulatory authorities would consider clinically meaningful 

• in an effort to optimize product features we have in the past and may continue to make changes to our investigational medicines after we commence clinical trials of an investigational medicine which may require us to repeat earlier stages of clinical testing or delay later stage testing of the investigational medicine 

• clinical trials of any investigational medicines may fail to show safety or efficacy or produce negative or inconclusive results and we may decide or regulators may require us to conduct additional nonclinical studies or clinical trials or we may decide to abandon product development programs 

• differences in trial design between earlystage clinical trials and laterstage clinical trials make it difficult to extrapolate the results of earlier clinical trials to later clinical trials 

• preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many investigational medicines believed to have performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval 

• our investigational medicines may have undesirable side effects such as the immunogenicity of the lnps or their components the immunogenicity of the protein made by the mrna or degradation products any of which could lead to serious adverse events or other effects one or more of such effects or events could cause regulators to impose a clinical hold on the applicable trial or cause us or our irbs or ethics committees to suspend or terminate the trial of that investigational medicine or any other of our investigational medicines for which a clinical trial may be ongoing 

• the number of trial participants required for clinical trials of any investigational medicines may be larger than we anticipate identification of trial participants for such trials may be limited enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate due to perceived adverse effects competitive trials size of the patient population or other reasons or participants may withdraw from clinical trials or fail to return for posttreatment followup at a higher rate than we anticipate 

• our thirdparty contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner or at all or may deviate from the clinical trial protocol or withdraw from the trial which may require that we add new clinical trial sites 

• regulators may elect to impose a clinical hold or we or our investigators irbs or ethics committees may elect to suspend or terminate clinical research or trials for various reasons including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable benefit risk ratio 

• the cost of preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies and clinical trials of any investigational medicines may be greater than we anticipate 

• the supply or quality of our investigational medicines or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials may be insufficient or inadequate 

• safety and efficacy concerns regarding one or more of our investigational medicines will be considered by us and by the fda and other global regulators as we pursue clinical trials of new investigational medicines develop effective informed consent documentation and work with irbs and scientific review committees srcs 

• safety or efficacy concerns regarding our investigational medicines may result from any safety or efficacy concerns arising from nonclinical or clinical testing of other therapies targeting a similar disease state or other therapies such as gene therapy that are perceived as similar to ours and 

• the fda or other regulatory authorities may require us to submit additional data such as longterm toxicology studies or impose other requirements before permitting us to initiate a clinical trial 

we could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities ethics committees or the irbs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted or if such trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the data safety monitoring board for such trial we have in the past been and may in the future be delayed in gaining clearance from the fda or other regulators to initiate clinical trials through the imposition of a clinical hold in order to address comments from such regulators on our clinical trial design or other elements of our clinical trials the clinical trials of other companies working on mrna medicines have been put on clinical hold by the fda a suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects including those experienced by other investigational medicines in the same class as our investigational medicines failure to demonstrate a benefit or adequate benefit risk ratio from using an investigational medicine failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our investigational medicines we must also complete extensive cmc activities that require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our clinical development candidates or investigational medicines if we are required to produce new batches of our development candidates or investigational medicines due to insufficient shelf life it may delay the commencement or completion of clinical trials of such development candidates or investigational medicines 

moreover the fda has indicated that prior to commencing laterstage clinical trials for our programs we will need to develop assays to measure and predict the potency of a given dose of our investigational medicines any delay in developing assays that are acceptable to the fda or other regulators could delay the start of future clinical trials further the fda or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data for our clinical trials additionally we have conducted and may conduct in the future clinical trials that utilize an “openlabel” trial design an “openlabel” clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved drug or placebo the results from an openlabel trial may not be predictive of future clinical trial results when studied in a controlled environment with a placebo or active control further the fda or other regulators may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our investigational medicines also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines and harming our business and results of operations any delays in the development of our investigational medicines may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly 

we may experience delays in identifying and enrolling participants in our clinical trials which would delay the progress of our investigational medicines and result in increased expenses 

we depend on enrollment of participants in our clinical trials for our investigational medicines we may find it difficult to enroll trial participants in our clinical trials which could delay or prevent clinical trials of our investigational medicines identifying and qualifying trial participants to participate in clinical trials of our investigational medicines is critical to our success the timing of our clinical trials depends on the speed at which we can recruit trial participants to participate in testing our investigational medicines delays in enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our investigational medicines if trial participants are unwilling to participate in our trials because of negative publicity from adverse events in our trials or other trials of similar products or those related to specific therapeutic area or for other reasons including competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations the timeline for recruiting trial participants conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed these delays could result in increased costs delays in advancing our product development delays in testing the effectiveness of our product or termination of the clinical trials altogether 

we may not be able to identify recruit and enroll a sufficient number of trial participants or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a trial to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner in addition as we did in our phase 3 clinical study of mrna1273 in september 2020 we may slow enrollment in a trial to focus on achieving greater diversity in the subject population patient and subject enrollment is affected by factors including 

• severity of the disease under investigation 

• complexity and design of the study protocol 

• size of the patient population 

• eligibility criteria for the study in question including agebased eligibility criteria limiting subject enrollment to adolescent or pediatric populations 

• proximity and availability of clinical study sites for prospective trial participants 

• availability of competing therapies and clinical trials including between our own clinical trials 

• efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials 

• patient referral practices of physicians 

• ability to monitor trial participants adequately during and after treatment 

• ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience 

• clinicians’ and trial participants’ perceptions as to the potential advantages and side effects of the investigational medicine being studied in relation to other available therapies including any new drugs or treatments that may be approved for the indications we are investigating 

• the need in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine to wait for the manufacture of the personalized drug product and 

• our ability to obtain and maintain participant informed consent 

in addition our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for investigational medicines that are in the same therapeutic areas as our investigational medicines and this competition will reduce the number and types of trial participants available to us because some trial participants who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by a third party since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use which will reduce the number of trial participants who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites moreover because in some cases our investigational medicines represent a departure from more traditional methods for disease treatment and prevention potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies or other new therapies rather than enroll trial participants in any future clinical trial involving mrna investigational medicines additionally if new investigational medicines such as gene editing therapies show encouraging results potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to enroll trial participants in clinical trials using those investigational medicines if such new investigational medicines show discouraging results or other adverse safety indications potential trial participants and their doctors may be less inclined to enroll trial participants in our clinical trials we also have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators control the development of certain of our investigational medicines which may provide us limited or no ability to influence the enrollment rate of our clinical trials even if we are able to enroll trial participants there is no guarantee that they will ultimately be dosed as part of or complete a clinical trial 

mrna medicines are a novel approach and negative perception of the efficacy safety or tolerability of any investigational medicines that we develop could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business advance our investigational medicines or obtain regulatory approvals 

other than the eua and other similar authorizations for covid19 vaccines including ours no mrna medicines have been granted eua or have been approved to date by the fda or any other regulatory agency adverse events in clinical trials of our investigational medicines or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity as well as any other adverse events in the field of mrna medicine or other products that are perceived to be similar to mrna medicines such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs increased regulatory scrutiny decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our investigational medicines and less demand for any product that we may develop our large pipeline of development candidates and investigational medicines could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions other reportable negative clinical outcomes manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the fda or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs as well as our business as a whole in addition responses by us state or foreign governments to negative public perception may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop any investigational medicines or commercialize any approved products obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability more restrictive statutory regimes government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development of our investigational medicines and commercialization of any approved products or demand for any products we may develop 

because we are developing some of our development candidates or investigational medicines for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and in some cases using new endpoints or methodologies the fda or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results 

there are no pharmacologic therapies approved to treat the underlying causes of many diseases that we currently attempt to address or may address in the future for instance for both mma and pa few clinical trials have been attempted in addition there has been limited clinical trial experience for the development of pharmaceuticals to treat these rare diseases in general and we are not aware of a registrational trial that led to approval of a drug to treat these diseases there have been some historical trials with other agents to address organic acidemias which may have utilized clinical endpoints that are less applicable to our efforts with our mma and pa 

programs that address the underlying defect as a result the design and conduct of clinical trials of investigational medicines for the treatment of these disorders and other disorders may take longer be more costly or be less effective as part of the novelty of development in these diseases 

even if the fda does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful we may not achieve the prespecified endpoint to a degree of statistical significance in any pivotal or other clinical trials we or our strategic collaborators may conduct for our programs further even if we do achieve the prespecified criteria our trials may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with the results of the more traditional efficacy endpoints in the trial the fda also could give overriding weight to other efficacy endpoints over a primary endpoint even if we achieve statistically significant results on that endpoint if we do not do so on our secondary efficacy endpoints the fda also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks and the fda may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of licensure other regulatory authorities in europe and other countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints 

some of our investigational medicines are classified as gene therapies by the fda and the ema and the fda has indicated that our investigational medicines will be reviewed within its center for biologics evaluation and research cber even though our mrna investigational medicines are designed to have a different mechanism of action from gene therapies the association of our investigational medicines with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens impair the reputation of our investigational medicines or negatively impact our platform or our business 

there have been few approvals of gene therapy products in the united states or foreign jurisdictions and there have been wellreported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use gene therapy products have the effect of introducing new dna and potentially irreversibly changing the dna in a cell by contrast mrna is highly unlikely to localize to the nucleus integrate into the dna or otherwise make any permanent changes to cell dna consequently we expect that our investigational medicines will have a different potential side effect profile from gene therapies 

regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future and the implications for mrnabased therapies are unknown for example the fda has established the office of tissues and advanced therapies within cber to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products and convenes the cellular tissue and gene therapies advisory committee to advise cber on its review in the european union mrna has been characterized as a gene therapy medicinal product which falls within a broader category known as advanced therapy medicinal products or atmps which are subject to additional regulatory requirements in certain countries mrna therapies have not yet been classified or any such classification is not known to us specifically in japan the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency has not taken a position on the regulatory classification notwithstanding the differences between our mrna investigational medicines and gene therapies the classification of some of our mrna investigational medicines as gene therapies in the united states the european union and potentially other countries could adversely impact our ability to develop our investigational medicines and could negatively impact our platform and our business for instance a clinical hold on gene therapy products across the field due to risks associated with altering cell dna irreversibly may apply to our mrna investigational medicines irrespective of the mechanistic differences between gene therapies and mrna 

adverse events reported with respect to gene therapies or genome editing therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs although our mrna development candidates and investigational medicines are designed not to make any permanent changes to cell dna regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies products caused by introducing new dna and irreversibly changing the dna in a cell could also be a risk for our mrna investigational therapies and as a result may delay one or more of our trials or impose additional testing for longterm side effects any new requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory review agencies may have a negative effect on our business by lengthening the regulatory review process requiring us to perform additional or larger studies or increasing our development costs any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines or lead to significant postapproval studies limitations or restrictions as we advance our investigational medicines we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines if we fail to do so we may be required to delay or discontinue development of some or all of our investigational medicines 

a breakthrough therapy designation or fast track designation by the fda for a drug may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it would not increase the likelihood that the drug will receive marketing approval 

we may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for one or more of our investigational medicines a breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development for drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies interaction and communication between the fda and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the fda are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the bla 

designation as a breakthrough therapy is at the discretion of the fda accordingly even if we believe that one of our investigational medicines meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation in any event the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a drug may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the fda even if we are successful in obtaining accelerated approval in the united states or under comparable pathways in other jurisdictions we may face requirements and limitations that will adversely affect our prospects for example we may be approved only for a very limited indication we may not successfully complete required postapproval trials such trials may not confirm the clinical benefit of our drug or approval of the drug may be withdrawn in addition even if one or more of our investigational medicines qualify as breakthrough therapies the fda may later decide that the investigational medicine no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for fda review or approval will not be shortened 

we have received fast track designation for some of our investigational medicines and may seek fast track designation for others if a therapy is intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening condition and the therapy demonstrates the potential to address significant unmet medical needs for this condition the drug sponsor may apply for fast track designation the fda has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation and even if we believe a particular investigational medicine is eligible for this designation we cannot assure you that the fda would decide to grant it even if we do receive fast track designation we may not experience a faster development process review or approval compared to conventional fda procedures the fda may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the fda’s priority review procedures 

we may fail to obtain and maintain orphan drug designations from the fda or ema for our future investigational medicines as applicable 

our strategy includes filing for orphan drug designation where available for our investigational medicines and we have received orphan drug designation from both the fda and the european commission for pa mrna3927 and our prior mma candidate mrna3704 under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200000 in the united states or a patient population greater than 200000 in the united states where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the united states in the united states orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs tax advantages and userfee waivers however orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications including a full new drug application or nda or biologics license application or bla to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the original manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity 

in addition exclusive marketing rights in the united states may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphandesignated indication or may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective further even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may receive and be approved for the same condition and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity even after an orphandesignated product is approved the fda can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care in addition while we may seek additional orphan drug designation for our investigational medicines we may never receive such further designations 

the criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the european economic area consisting of member states of the european union plus iceland liechtenstein and norway or the eea are similar in principle to those in the united states under article 3 of regulation ec 1412000 a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if it meets the following criteria i it is intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of a lifethreatening or chronically debilitating condition and ii either the prevalence of such condition must not be more than five in 10000 persons in the eea when the application is made or without the benefits derived from orphan status it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the eea to justify the investment needed for its development and iii there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis prevention or treatment of such condition or if such a method exists the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers made available by the eea and its member states to support research into and the development and availability of orphan drugs however orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process if products with an orphan designation obtain a marketing authorization they can receive ten years of market exclusivity during which time no “similar medicinal product” for the same indication may be placed on the market a “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication market exclusivity may however be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation for example if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity orphan medicine marketing exclusivity may also be revoked in certain cases such as if it is established that a similar medicinal product is safer more effective or otherwise clinically superior or if not enough orphan medicinal product can be supplied 

our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 or aca includes a subtitle called the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 the bpcia which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdaapproved reference biological product under the bpcia an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the fda until four years following the date that the reference product was first approved by the fda in addition the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the fda until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first approved during this 12year period of exclusivity another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the fda approves a bla for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety purity and potency of the other company’s product the law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty 

we believe that any of our investigational medicines approved as a biological product under a bla should qualify for the 12year period of exclusivity however there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise or that the fda will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated other aspects of the bpcia some of which may impact the bpcia exclusivity provisions have also been the subject of recent litigation moreover the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing 

any clinical trials of our oncologyrelated products that we conduct with a seamless trial design may not be acceptable to regulatory authorities in the form submitted or at all which may delay our clinical development and limit or change the type of information we may gather from our clinical trials 

we may pursue a development program for our oncologyrelated products that relies upon a seamless trial design which presents additional risks compared to traditional threephase development programs a seamless trial design can be achieved through a firstinhuman fih multiple expansion cohort trial which has a single protocol with an initial doseescalation phase and also contains three or more additional patient cohorts with cohortspecific objectives fih multiple expansion cohort trials are intended to expedite development by seamlessly proceeding from initial determination of a potential effective dose to individual cohorts that have trial objectives typical of phase 2 trials challenges and risks associated with such seamless trial designs include challenges in the timely dissemination of new safety information to investigators irbs and regulators exposing a large number of patients across cohorts to potentially suboptimal or toxic doses of an investigational drug exposing more patients than is needed to achieve the cohort’s objectives and missed interpretations of preliminary trial results and unplanned analyses which can lead to delays in clinical development regulatory authorities may find our seamless trial designs unacceptable based on these and other risks of utilizing such designs 

if we are not able to obtain or if there are delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals we will not be able to commercialize or will be delayed in commercializing investigational medicines we may develop and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired 

even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials the marketing approval process is expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of any development candidates and investigational medicines we may develop any mrna medicine we may develop and the activities associated with its development and commercialization including design testing manufacture recordkeeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and by comparable global health authorities to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe pure and potent or effective in humans including the target population successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a bla to the fda a marketing authorization application maa to the ema and similar marketing applications to comparable global regulatory authorities for each investigational medicine and consequently the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any investigational medicines 

failure to obtain marketing approval for an investigational medicine will prevent us from commercializing the investigational medicine in a given jurisdiction we have not received approval to market any investigational medicines from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction and it is possible that none of our investigational medicines or any investigational medicines we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval we have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and may need to rely on thirdparty cros or regulatory consultants to assist us in this process to our knowledge there is no current precedent for an mrnabased medicine such as the types we are developing being approved for sale by the fda or any other global regulatory agency although we expect to submit blas for our mrnabased investigational medicines in the united states other jurisdictions may consider our mrnabased investigational medicines to be new drugs not biologics and require different marketing applications securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the investigational medicine’s safety and efficacy securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to and inspection of manufacturing facilities by the relevant regulatory authority any investigational medicines we develop may not be effective may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use 

the process of obtaining marketing approvals both in the united states and abroad is expensive may take many years if additional clinical trials are required if approval is obtained at all and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors including the type complexity and novelty of the investigational medicines involved changes in marketing approval policies during the development period changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application the fda and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical clinical or other studies in addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing approval of an investigational medicine any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or postapproval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable additional delays or nonapproval may result if an fda advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends nonapproval or restrictions on approval in addition we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development clinical trials and the review process 

regulatory agencies also may approve an mrna medicine for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of postmarketing studies in addition regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our investigational medicines 

the fda and other regulatory agencies review the cmc section of regulatory filings any aspects found unsatisfactory by regulatory agencies may result in delays in clinical trials and commercialization in addition the regulatory agencies conduct preapproval inspections at the time of a bla any findings by regulatory agencies and failure to comply with requirements may lead to delay in approval and failure to commercialize the potential mrna investigational medicine 

if we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any investigational medicines we may develop the commercial prospects for those investigational medicines will be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired 

we may never obtain ema or other foreign regulatory body approval for any of our investigational medicines and even if we do we may never be able to commercialize any of our investigational medicines in any other jurisdiction which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential 

to date our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 is our only product that has obtained an eua from the fda in the united states and similar authorizations in other jurisdictions approval of an investigational medicine by the fda if obtained does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions in order to eventually market any of our investigational medicines in any particular foreign jurisdiction we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis regarding safety and efficacy in addition clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 

seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming regulatory requirements can vary widely from countrytocountry and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries the foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with fda approval we do not have any investigational medicines approved for sale in any jurisdiction including international markets and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized 

our planned clinical trials or those of our strategic collaborators may reveal significant adverse events not seen in our preclinical or nonclinical studies and may result in a safety profile that could delay or terminate clinical trials or delay or prevent regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our investigational medicines 

there is typically an extremely high rate of attrition for product candidates across categories of medicines proceeding through clinical trials these product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile in later stages of clinical trials despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in laterstage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety profiles notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are never approved as products and there can be no assurance that any of our current or future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our investigational medicines 

some of our investigational medicines are developed or intended to be coadministered with other developmental therapies or approved medicines for example our pcv investigational medicine mrna4157 and our kras investigational medicine mrna5671 in collaboration with merck may be coadministered with merck’s antipd1 therapy pembrolizumab our il12 investigational medicine medi1191 in collaboration with astrazeneca is being developed to be coadministered with checkpoint inhibitors eg antipdl1 antictla4 these combinations may have additional side effects the uncertainty resulting from the use of our investigational medicines in combination with other therapies may make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials 

some of our development candidates and investigational medicines are developed or intended for adolescent andor pediatric patients under the age of eighteen including our hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 pa development candidate mrna3927 and mma development candidate mrna3705 the first pediatric subjects in the phase 1b age deescalation clinical trial of mrna1653 have been enrolled and dosed during the covid19 related pause the safety monitoring committee reviewed a preliminary data set on these small initial group of pediatric patients and recommended continuation of the study with no modification in the planned trial execution our pa development candidate mrna3927 for which we are conducting a firstinhuman phase 12 trial in patients between one and eighteen years of age has resumed study start up activities if participants are enrolled in the trial and successfully dosed they will be the first of our rare disease investigational medicines from our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality dosed in humans the uncertainty resulting from the first dosing of young human subjects with an investigational medicine makes it difficult to accurately predict if significant adverse events or other side effects will be observed 

most of our investigational medicines are formulated and administered in an lnp which when administered may lead to systemic side effects related to the components of the lnp some of which may not have been previously tested in humans while we have continued to optimize our lnps there can be no assurance that our lnps will not have undesired effects our lnps could contribute in whole or in part to one or more of the following immune reactions infusion reactions complement reactions opsonization reactions antibody reactions or reactions to peg certain aspects of our investigational medicines may induce immune reactions from either the mrna or the lipid as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mrna or the lnp any of which could lead to significant adverse events in one or more of our clinical trials many of these types of side effects have been seen for 

previously developed lnps there may be resulting uncertainty as to the underlying cause of any such adverse event which would make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials and would result in significant delays in our programs 

if significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials we may have difficulty recruiting trial participants to any of our clinical trials trial participants may withdraw from trials or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of one or more development candidates or investigational medicines altogether we the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities or an irb may impose a clinical hold or suspend or terminate clinical trials of an investigational medicine at any time for various reasons including a belief that participants in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in earlystage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval unfavorable benefit risk ratio may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies any of these developments could materially harm our business financial condition and prospects 

even if we obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medicine and even though we have obtained an eua for our covid19 vaccine our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny 

even if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction the applicable regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly postapproval studies or postmarket surveillance for example the holder of an approved bla is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the bla the holder of an approved bla must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product product labeling or manufacturing process advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our investigational medicines a regulatory agency may 

• issue a warning letter asserting that we are in violation of the law 

• seek an injunction or impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines 

• suspend or withdraw regulatory approval or revoke a license 

• suspend any ongoing clinical trials 

• refuse to approve a pending bla or supplements to a bla submitted by us 

• seize product or 

• refuse to allow us to enter into supply contracts including government contracts 

any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize any approved products and generate revenues 

if any of our investigational medicines cause undesirable side effects it could delay or prevent their regulatory approval limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval investigational medicines we may develop may be associated with an adverse immune response or other serious adverse events undesirable side effects or unexpected characteristics in addition to serious adverse events or side effects caused by any of our investigational medicines the administration process or related procedures also can cause undesirable side effects if any such events occur the clinical trials of any of our investigational medicines could be suspended or terminated 

if in the future we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by factors other than our investigational medicine the fda the ema or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of any of our investigational medicines for any or all targeted indications even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not productrelated such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled trial participants to complete the trial moreover if we elect or are required to delay suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our investigational medicines the commercial prospects of such investigational medicines may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these investigational medicines may be delayed or eliminated any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop investigational medicines and may harm our business financial condition result of operations and prospects significantly 

additionally if we successfully obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medicine the fda or other regulatory authority could require us to adopt a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such investigational medicine outweigh the risks for each potential patient which may include among other things a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients a communication plan to health care practitioners extensive patient monitoring or 

distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry furthermore if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop several potentially significant negative consequences could result including 

• regulatory authorities may suspend or withdraw approvals or revoke licenses of such product 

• regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label 

• we may be required to change the way a product is administered or conduct additional clinical trials 

• we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients and their children and 

• our reputation may suffer 

any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any products we may identify and develop and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are successful in gaining approval for any of our investigational medicines we will continue to face significant regulatory oversight of the manufacturing and distribution of our products product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp and adherence to commitments made in the bla if we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing 

even though mrna1273 has been granted an eua mrna1273 will remain the subject of regulatory scrutiny for example the eua issued by the fda contains numerous conditions of authorization including the requirement to conduct postauthorization observational studies to evaluate the association between mrna1273 and a prespecified list of adverse events of special interest along with deaths and hospitalizations and severe covid19 we or others could identify previously unknown side effects or known side effects could be observed as being more frequent or severe than in clinical studies or earlier postmarketing periods in which case 

• sales of mrna1273 may be more modest than originally anticipated 

• the fda and other regulatory agencies may revoke an eua or other authorizations for mrna1273 

• we may decide or be required to conduct recalls or send field alerts to physicians pharmacists and hospitals 

• additional nonclinical or clinical studies changes in labeling or changes to manufacturing processes specifications andor facilities may be required and 

• government investigations or lawsuits including class action suits may be brought against us 

further should we be unable to follow the conditions of authorization included in the eua the fda may revoke eua for mrna1273 any of the above occurrences could reduce or prevent sales of mrna1273 increase our expenses and impair our ability to successfully commercialize mrna1273 

risks related to the manufacturing of our commercial products development candidates investigational medicines and our future pipeline 

our mrna products development candidates and investigational medicines are based on novel technologies and any development candidates and investigational medicines we develop may be complex and difficult to manufacture we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping for any of our medicines including our covid19 vaccine if we or any of our thirdparty manufacturers encounter such difficulties our ability to supply commercial product or material for clinical trials or any approved product could be delayed or stopped 

the manufacturing processes for our commercial products development candidates and investigational medicines are novel and complex other than vaccines for active immunization to prevent covid19 caused by sarscov2 including our covid19 vaccine that have received euas from the fda or similar authorizations by authorities in other jurisdictions there are no mrna medicines commercialized to date or manufactured at such scale due to the novel nature of this technology and our limited experience at larger scale production we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping these difficulties could be due to any number of reasons including but not limited to complexities of producing batches at larger scale equipment failure choice and quality of raw materials and excipients analytical testing technology and product instability in an effort to optimize product features we have in the past and may in the future make changes to our development candidates or investigational medicines in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions this has in the past and may in the future result in our having to resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply insufficient stability or shelf life of our development candidates 

and investigational medicines could materially delay our or our strategic collaborators’ ability to continue the clinical trial for that development candidate or investigational medicine or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product due to the need to manufacture additional preclinical or clinical supply 

our rate of innovation is high which has resulted in and will continue to cause a high degree of technology change that can negatively impact product comparability during and after clinical development furthermore technology changes may drive the need for changes in modification to or the sourcing of new manufacturing infrastructure or may adversely affect thirdparty relationships 

the process to generate mrna medicines encapsulated in lnps is complex and if not developed and manufactured under wellcontrolled conditions can adversely impact pharmacological activity furthermore prior to our recent scaleup for our covid19 vaccine we had not manufactured mrna medicines at commercial scale we may encounter difficulties in continuing to scale up our manufacturing process thereby potentially impacting clinical and commercial supply 

we are scaling up our batch size to accommodate the clinical supply requirements of some of our programs however in many cases we may have to utilize multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the clinical supply requirement of a single clinical trial failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials or in the commercialization of any approved product 

as we continue developing new manufacturing processes for our drug substance and drug product the changes we implement to manufacturing process may in turn impact specification and stability of the drug product changes in our manufacturing processes may lead to failure of batches and this could lead to a substantial delay in delivery of commercial product or conduct of our clinical trials our mrna investigational medicines may prove to have a stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved mrna medicine this poses risk in supply requirements wasted stock and higher cost of goods 

we are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology further we have developed our own custom manufacturing equipment for certain of our medicines if such equipment malfunctions or we encounter unexpected performance issues we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply due to the number of different programs we may have cross contamination of investigational medicines inside of our factories cros suppliers or in the clinic that affect the integrity of our investigational medicines 

as we scale the manufacturing output for commercial production and particular programs we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our commercial products development candidates and investigational medicines from indenabling studies through commercial launch including shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance because of continuous improvement in manufacturing processes we may switch processes for a particular program during development however after the change in process more time is required for pharmaceutical property testing such as 6 or 12 month stability testing that may require resupplying clinical material or making additional cgmp batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed 

we are utilizing a number of raw materials and excipients that have a single source of supply are new to the pharmaceutical industry and are being employed in a novel manner some of these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures or supply shortages such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our investigational medicines 

we have established a number of analytical assays and may have to establish several more to assess the quality of our mrna investigational medicines we may identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall for example we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety efficacy or stability this may lead to an inability to release mrna investigational medicines until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified 

our products and product intermediates are extremely temperature sensitive and we may learn that any or all of our investigational medicines are less stable than desired we may also find that transportation conditions negatively impact product quality this may require changes to the formulation or manufacturing process for one or more of our investigational medicines and result in delays or interruptions to clinical or commercial supply in addition the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of vendors may also add additional risks of supply disruptions 

as our drug development pipeline increases and matures the increased demand for clinical and commercial supplies from our facilities and third parties may impact our ability to operate we will require increased capacity across our entire supply chain furthermore we rely on many service providers including those that provide manufacturing or testing services all of whom have inherent risks in their operations that may adversely impact our operations 

completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our vaccine candidates require access to or development of facilities to manufacture our vaccine candidates at sufficient yields and at commercialscale we have limited experience manufacturing any of our vaccine candidates in the volumes that are necessary to support largescale clinical trials or commercial sales efforts to establish these capabilities may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling scaleup reproducibility yield purity cost potency or quality in addition other companies many with substantial resources compete with us for access to the materials needed to manufacture our vaccines 

we currently utilize and expect to continue to utilize third parties to among other things manufacture raw materials components parts and consumables and to perform quality testing if the field of mrna and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand we may encounter increasing competition for these materials and services demand for thirdparty manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity which could disrupt our ability to find and retain thirdparty manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials components parts and consumables required to manufacture our mrna investigational medicines the use of service providers and suppliers could expose us to risks including but not limited to 

• termination or nonrenewal of supply and service agreements with third parties in a manner or at a time that is costly or damaging to us 

• disruptions to the operations of these suppliers and service providers caused by conditions unrelated to our business or operations including the bankruptcy of the supplier or service provider and 

• inspections of thirdparty facilities by regulatory authorities that could have a negative outcome and result in delays to or termination of their ability to supply our requirements 

our reliance on thir dparty manufacturers may adversely affect our operations or result in unforeseen delays or other problems beyond our control because of contractual restraints and the limited number of thirdparty manufacturers with the expertise required regulatory approvals and facilities to manufacture our bulk vaccines on a commercial scale replacement of a manufacturer may be expensive and timeconsuming and may cause interruptions in the production of our vaccine a thirdparty manufacturer may also encounter difficulties in production these problems may include 

• difficulties with production costs scale up and yields 

• availability of raw materials and supplies 

• quality control and assurance 

• shortages of qualified personnel 

• compliance with strictly enforced federal state and foreign regulations that vary in each country where products might be sold and 

• lack of capital funding 

as a result any delay or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations 

the illegal distribution and sale by third parties of counterfeit versions of mrna products stolen products or alternative thirdparty distribution and sale of mrna products could have a negative impact on our financial performance or reputation 

third parties could illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of mrna products especially on online marketplaces which do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards under cgmp counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and may even be lifethreatening counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances or the wrong dose however to distributors and users counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version 

reports of adverse reactions to counterfeit products increased levels of counterfeiting or unsafe mrna products could materially affect patient confidence in our mrna products it is possible that adverse events caused by unsafe counterfeit or other nonmrna products will mistakenly be attributed to our mrna products in addition thefts of inventory at warehouses plants or while intransit which are not properly stored and which are sold through unauthorized channels could adversely impact patient safety our reputation and our business public loss of confidence in the integrity in mrna products as a result of counterfeiting theft or improper manufacturing processes could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition 

we are subject to regulatory and operational risks associated with the physical and digital infrastructure at both our internal manufacturing facilities and at those of our external service providers 

in 2018 we completed construction of a new manufacturing facility moderna technology center or mtc in norwood massachusetts that among other things is intended for cgmp manufacture of drug substance and drug product while the design of the facility is based on current standards for biotechnology facilities and it has been visited by the fda it has not been subject to formal review inspection or preapproved by any regulatory agency such as the fda we only recently began producing drug product and drug substance at the mtc for commercial use 

we have designed the mtc to incorporate a significant level of automation of equipment with integration of several digital systems to improve efficiency of operations we have attempted to achieve a high level of digitization for a clinical and commercial manufacturing facility relative to industry standards while this is meant to improve operational efficiency this may pose additional risk of process equipment malfunction and even overall manufacturing system failure or shutdown due to internal or external factors including but not limited to design issues system compatibility or potential cybersecurity breaches our facilities or those of our contract manufacturers may also be subject to intentional attacks or acts of sabotage whether by outside actors contractors or employees these disruptions may lead to delay in supply or shutdown of our facility or facilities any disruption in our manufacturing capabilities at the mtc or those of our contract manufacturers could cause delays in our production capacity for our drug substances or drug products impose additional costs or may require us to identify qualify and establish an alternative manufacturing site the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as we expand our development and commercial capacity we may establish additional manufacturing capabilities inside the mtc footprint or expand to other locations or geographies which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly if we fail to select the correct location complete the construction in an efficient manner recruit the required personnel and generally manage our growth effectively the development and production of commercial products or our investigational medicines could be delayed or curtailed additional investments may be needed if changes in our manufacturing process lead to required changes in the mtc’s infrastructure 

there are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing operations that could affect our ability and the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or contract manufacturing organizations to meet our delivery requirements or provide adequate amounts of material 

the convergence of process and analytical technology raw materials consumables equipment physical infrastructure including a clean room environment and air handling and other utilities results in complex procedures and systems that have to work effectively to manufacture our investigational medicines failure or process defects in any of the interrelated systems at either our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty providers could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and supply our covid19 vaccine or our investigational medicines 

our products and investigational medicines are inherently sensitive to shipping and storage conditions which in some cases requires coldchain logistics and could subject our investigational medicines to risk of loss or damage 

our covid19 vaccine and our investigational medicines are sensitive to temperature storage and handling conditions loss in investigational medicines could occur if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly shelf life for our products and investigational medicines may vary by product and is not fully quantified and is expected to be variable and it is possible that our investigational medicines could be lost due to expiration prior to use coldchain logistics are required for certain of our investigational medicines as well as for our covid19 vaccine if we or thirdparty distributors do not effectively maintain effective coldchain supply logistics then we may experience an unusual number of returned or out of date products and critical batches of products may be rendered unusable 

failure to effectively maintain coldchain supply logistics by us or third parties has in the past and could in the future lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials commercial sale or otherwise 

we are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing our covid19 vaccine and our mrna investigational medicines our manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers may not meet regulatory requirements failure to meet cgmp requirements set forth in regulations promulgated by the fda ema and other global health authorities could result in significant delays in any approval of and costs of our products 

the manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation components of a finished product approved for commercial use or used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cgmp requirements these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures including record keeping and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of products and materials used in clinical trials poor control of the cgmp production processes can lead to product quality failures that can impact our ability to supply product resulting in cost overruns and delays to clinical timelines which could be extensive such production process issues include but are not limited to 

• critical deviations in the manufacturing process 

• facility and equipment failures 

• contamination of the product due to an ineffective quality control strategy 

• facility contamination as assessed by the facility and utility environmental monitoring program 

• ineffective process equipment or analytical change management resulting in failed lot release criteria 

• raw material failures due to ineffective supplier qualification or regulatory compliance issues at critical suppliers 

• ineffective product stability 

• failed lot release or facility and utility quality control testing 

• ineffective corrective actions or preventative actions taken to correct or avoid critical deviations due to our developing understanding of the manufacturing process as we scale and 

• failed or defective components or consumables 

we must supply all necessary documentation in support of a bla or other marketing authorization application on a timely basis and must adhere to the fda’s ema’s and other countries’ cgmp requirements which are enforced in the case of the fda in part through its facilities inspection program 

regulatory authorities typically require representative manufacturing site inspections to assess adequate compliance with cgmp and manufacturing controls as described in the filing if either we or one of our thirdparty manufacturing sites fails to provide sufficient quality assurance or control the product approval to commercialize may not be granted inspections by regulatory authorities may occur at any time during the development or commercialization phase of products the inspections may be product specific or facility specific for broader cgmp inspections or as a follow up to market or development issues that the regulatory agency may identify deficient inspection outcomes may influence the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations impacting or delaying supply or delaying programs 

the manufacturing process for our covid19 vaccine and for any other products that we may develop is subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority approval process and we may need to contract with manufacturers who we believe can meet applicable fda and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis if we or our thirdparty manufacturers are unable to reliably produce products or investigational medicines to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities we or our strategic collaborators may not obtain or maintain the approvals we or they need to commercialize such products even if we or our strategic collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our mrna medicines and even though we have received an eua for our covid19 vaccine there is no assurance that either we or our contract manufacturing organizations will be able to manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials increase clinical trial costs delay approval of our investigational medicines impair commercialization efforts or increase our cost of goods the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control quality assurance and qualified personnel furthermore all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply or manufacture materials or products for such companies which exposes our contract manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products as a result failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory status of our contract manufacturers’ facility in addition to the extent that we rely on foreign contract manufacturers including for our covid19 vaccine we are or will be subject to additional risks including the need to comply with import and export regulations our failure or the failure of our thirdparty manufacturers or other strategic collaborators to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us including clinical holds fines injunctions civil penalties delays suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation seizures or recalls of investigational medicines or products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and investigational medicines including those of our strategic collaborators and our overall business operations our 

potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our investigational medicines and raw materials may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis 

the fda the ema and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time under some circumstances the fda the ema or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we do not distribute a lot or lots until the relevant agency authorizes such release deviations in the manufacturing process including those affecting quality attributes and stability may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls our thirdparty contract manufacturers have in the past experienced lot failures and some may have experienced product recalls lot failures have in the past caused and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own facilities or those of our thirdparty manufacturers could cause us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific qualitycontrol and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes and operations which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements while we will train and qualify all personnel around the appropriate handling of our products and materials we may not be able to control for or ultimately detect intentional sabotage or negligence by any employee or contractor 

risks specific to certain investigational medicines 

our personalized cancer vaccine or pcv investigational medicine is uniquely manufactured for each patient using a novel complex manufacturing process and we may encounter difficulties in production 

we custom design and manufacture pcvs that are unique and tailored specifically for each patient manufacturing unique lots of pcvs is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with 

• logistics associated with the collection of a patient’s tumor blood or other tissue sample 

• shipping such samples to a facility for genetic sequencing 

• next generation sequencing of the tumor mrna 

• identification of appropriate tumorspecific mutations 

• the use of a software program including proprietary and open source components which is hosted in the cloud and a part of our investigational medicine to assist with the design of the patientspecific mrna which software must be maintained and secured 

• effective design of the patientspecific mrna that encodes for the required neoantigens 

• batch specific manufacturing failures or issues that arise due to the uniqueness of each patientspecific batch that may not have been foreseen 

• quality control testing failures 

• unexpected failures of batches placed on stability 

• shortages or quality control issues with singleuse assemblies consumables or critical parts sourced from thirdparty vendors that must be changed out for each patientspecific batch 

• significant costs associated with individualized manufacturing that may adversely affect our ability to continue development 

• successful and timely manufacture and release of the patientspecific batch 

• shipment issues encountered during transport of the batch to the patient site of care and 

• the ability to define a consistent safety profile at a given dose when each participant receives a unique vaccine 

we have built and installed custom manufacturing equipment for pcv that has been incorporated into a personalized vaccine unit in the mtc this unit is currently operational and we are producing batches of pcv from the mtc this equipment may not function as designed which may lead to deviations in the drug product being produced this can lead to increased batch failure and the inability to supply patients enrolled in the clinical trial if our clinical development plans are expanded due to the custom nature of the equipment and singleuse assemblies we may not be able to supply this expanded need reliably without significant investments in addition there will be considerable time to scale up our facilities or build new facilities before we can begin to meet any commercial demand if our pcv product is approved this expansion or addition of new facilities could also lead to product comparability issues which can further delay introduction of new capacity 

because our pcvs are manufactured for each individual patient we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient’s tissue sample sequence data derived from such tissue sample results of analysis of such patient’s genomic analysis and the custom manufactured product for each patient maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex and failure to do so has in the past and may in the future result in product mix up adverse patient outcomes loss of product or regulatory action including 

withdrawal of any approved products from the market further as our pcv investigational medicine is developed through earlystage clinical trials to laterstage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection analysis manufacture and delivery process will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results these changes may not achieve the intended objectives and any of these changes could cause our pcvs to perform differently than we expect potentially affecting the results of clinical trials 

risks related to our reliance on third parties 

we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into strategic alliances with third parties for the development and commercialization of our products development candidates and investigational medicines if these strategic alliances are not successful our business could be adversely affected 

we have limited resources to conduct clinical operations and we are in the process of establishing infrastructure for sales marketing and distribution accordingly we have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators have provided and may in the future provide funding and other resources for developing manufacturing and commercializing our investigational medicines we expect to enter into additional strategic alliances to access additional funding capabilities and expertise in the future our existing strategic alliances and any future strategic alliances we enter into may pose a number of risks including the following 

• strategic collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected 

• the clinical trials conducted as part of such strategic alliance may not be successful 

• strategic collaborators may not pursue development and commercialization of any investigational medicines that achieve regulatory approval or may elect not to continue or renew development or commercialization of programs based on clinical trial results changes in the strategic collaborators’ focus or available funding or external factors such as an acquisition that divert resources or create competing priorities 

• strategic collaborators may delay clinical trials provide insufficient funding for clinical trials stop a clinical trial abandon an investigational medicine repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of an investigational medicine for clinical testing 

• strategic collaborators could independently develop or develop with third parties products that compete directly or indirectly with our products or investigational medicines if the strategic collaborators believe that competitive products are more likely to be successfully developed or can be commercialized under terms that are more economically attractive than ours 

• products or investigational medicines developed in strategic alliances with us may be viewed by our strategic collaborators as competitive with their own investigational medicines or products which may cause strategic collaborators to cease to devote resources to the development or commercialization of our investigational medicines 

• a strategic collaborator with marketing and distribution rights to one or more of our products or investigational medicines that achieve regulatory approval may not commit sufficient resources to the marketing and distribution of any such product 

• disagreements with strategic collaborators including disagreements over proprietary rights contract interpretation or the preferred course of development of any investigational medicines may cause delays or termination of the research development or commercialization of such investigational medicines may lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to such investigational medicines or may result in litigation or arbitration any of which would be timeconsuming and expensive 

• strategic collaborators may not properly maintain or defend our ip rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our ip or proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation 

• disputes may arise with respect to the ownership of ip developed pursuant to our strategic alliances 

• strategic collaborators may infringe the ip rights of third parties which may expose us to litigation and potential liability 

• strategic alliances may be materially amended or terminated for the convenience of the strategic collaborator and if materially amended or terminated the development of our investigational medicines may be delayed and we could be required to raise additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable investigational medicines 

• future relationships may require us to incur nonrecurring and other charges increase our near and longterm expenditures issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business 

• we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators and the negotiation process is timeconsuming and complex and 

• our international operations through any future collaborations acquisitions or joint ventures may expose us to certain operating legal and other risks not encountered in the united states 

if our strategic alliances do not result in the successful development and commercialization of programs or if one of our strategic collaborators materially amends or terminates its agreement with us we may not receive any future research funding or milestone earnout royalty or other contingent payments under the strategic alliances if we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements our development of investigational medicines could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our 

investigational medicines in addition in general our strategic collaborators have the right to terminate their agreements with us for convenience a strategic collaborator has in the past terminated its agreement with us if one of our strategic collaborators terminates its agreement with us we may find it more difficult to attract new strategic collaborators and the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected all of the risks relating to product development regulatory approval and commercialization described in this annual report on form 10k apply to the activities of our strategic collaborators 

our strategic collaborators control aspects of our clinical trials regulatory activities and other aspects of our strategic alliances which could result in delays and other obstacles in the development and commercialization of our proposed products and materially harm our results of operations 

for some programs we depend on strategic collaborators to design and conduct clinical trials for our investigational medicines as a result we may not control the manner or time schedule in which these clinical trials are conducted which may negatively impact our business operations in addition if any of our strategic collaborators withdraws support for one or more of our programs or proposed products or otherwise impairs their development our business could be negatively affected 

we may seek to establish additional strategic alliances and if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans certain of our strategic alliance agreements may restrict our ability to develop certain products 

our development programs and the potential commercialization of our development candidates and investigational medicines will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses for some of our investigational medicines we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those investigational medicines 

we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators whether we reach a definitive agreement for any additional strategic alliances will depend among other things upon our assessment of the strategic collaborator’s resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed strategic alliance and the proposed strategic collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states the potential market for the subject investigational medicine the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such investigational medicine to trial participants the potential of competing drugs the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally the strategic collaborator may also consider alternative investigational medicines or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our investigational medicine the terms of any additional strategic alliances or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us 

we are also restricted under our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into certain future agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own these restrictions on working with targets polypeptides routes of administration and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with future strategic collaborators or to pursue certain potentially valuable development candidates or investigational medicines 

we may not be able to negotiate additional strategic alliances on a timely basis on favorable terms or at all strategic alliances are complex and timeconsuming to negotiate and document if we are unable to negotiate and enter into new strategic alliances we may have to curtail the development of the investigational medicine for which we are seeking to collaborate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own we may need to obtain additional capital which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all if we do not have sufficient funds we may not be able to further develop our investigational medicines or bring them to market and generate product revenue 

we are dependent on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and the processes required to develop our products development candidates and investigational medicines 

we currently depend on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and manufacturing processes required to develop and commercialize our products development candidates and investigational medicines we cannot ensure that these suppliers or service providers will remain in business have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to work with us our use of singlesource suppliers of raw materials components key processes and finished goods exposes us to several risks including disruptions in supply price increases or late deliveries there are in general relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components these vendors may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components materials and processes could take a substantial amount of time and it may 

be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet regulatory requirements any disruption in supply from any singlesource supplier or service provider could lead to supply delays or interruptions which would damage our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we have to switch to a replacement supplier the manufacture and delivery of our products development candidates or investigational medicines could be interrupted for an extended period which could adversely affect our business establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our products or investigational medicines if required may not be accomplished quickly if we are able to find a replacement supplier the replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval which could result in further delay while we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the singlesource components and materials used in our products any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner could impair our ability to meet the demand for our investigational medicines 

in addition as part of the fda’s approval of our investigational medicines we will also require fda review of the individual components of our process which include the manufacturing processes and facilities of our singlesource suppliers 

our reliance on these suppliers service providers and manufacturers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our reputation business and financial condition including among other things 

• delays to the development timelines for our development candidates or investigational medicines 

• interruption of supply resulting from modifications to or discontinuation of a supplier’s operations 

• delays in product shipments resulting from uncorrected defects reliability issues or a supplier’s variation in a component 

• a lack of longterm supply arrangements for key components with our suppliers 

• inability to obtain adequate supply in a timely manner or to obtain adequate supply on commercially reasonable terms 

• difficulty and cost associated with locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our components in a timely manner 

• production delays related to the evaluation and testing of components from alternative suppliers and corresponding regulatory qualifications 

• delay in delivery due to our suppliers’ prioritizing other customer orders over ours 

• damage to our reputation caused by defective components produced by our suppliers and 

• fluctuation in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers 

if any of these risks materialize costs could significantly increase and our ability to meet demand for our products could be impacted 

we rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our research preclinical studies protocol development and clinical trials for our development candidates or investigational medicines if these third parties do not perform satisfactorily comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our investigational medicines and our business could be substantially harmed 

we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties such as cros clinical data management organizations medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct certain research and preclinical testing activities in some cases these third parties may terminate their engagements with us if we need to enter into alternative arrangements it would delay our discovery or product development activities 

our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our regulatory or contractual responsibilities we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards for example we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial moreover the fda requires us to comply with regulations commonly referred to as gcps for conducting recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected we also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a governmentsponsored database clinicaltrialsgov within certain timeframes failure to do so can result in fines adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions for any violations of laws and regulations during the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials we could be subject to warning letters or enforcement action that may include civil penalties up to and including criminal prosecution 

we and our cros will be required to comply with regulations including gcps for conducting monitoring recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately informed among other things of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials we also are responsible for ensuring that the rights of our clinical trial participants are protected these regulations are enforced by the fda the competent authorities of the member states of the european economic area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any 

investigational medicines in clinical development the fda enforces gcp regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors principal investigators and trial sites if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable gcps the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications we cannot assure you that upon inspection the fda will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with gcps in addition our clinical trials must be conducted with investigational medicines produced in accordance with the requirements in cgmp regulations our failure or the failure of our cros to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action 

although we intend to design the clinical trials for certain of our investigational medicines our strategic collaborators will design the clinical trials that they are managing in some cases with our input and in the case of clinical trials controlled by us we expect that cros will conduct all of the clinical trials as a result many important aspects of our development programs including their conduct and timing will be outside of our direct control our reliance on third parties to conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials will also result in less direct control over the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff communicating with outside parties can also potentially lead to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities outside parties may 

• have staffing difficulties 

• fail to comply with contractual obligations 

• experience regulatory compliance issues 

• undergo changes in priorities or become financially distressed 

• form relationships with other entities some of which may be our competitors 

• have human errors or 

• be subject to cyberattacks 

these factors may materially adversely affect the willingness or ability of third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and may subject us to unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control if the cros do not perform preclinical studies and clinical trials in a satisfactory manner breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements the development regulatory approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines may be delayed we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our investigational medicines or our development programs may be materially and irreversibly harmed if we are unable to rely on preclinical and clinical data collected by our cros we could be required to repeat extend the duration of or increase the size of any clinical trials we conduct and this could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures 

we also expect to rely on other third parties to transport store and distribute the required materials for our clinical trials and for our manufacturing processes in the past certain of our thirdparty vendors have mishandled our materials resulting in loss of full or partial lots of material any further performance failure on the part of these third parties could result in damaged products and could delay clinical development or marketing approval of any investigational medicines we may develop or commercialization of our medicines if approved producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue causing us to default on our contractual commitments result in losses that are not covered by insurance and damage our reputation and overall perception of our products in the marketplace 

risks related to our intellectual property 

other companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products 

mrna medicines are a relatively new scientific field the continued development and potential use of which has resulted in many different patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain ip protection in the field we have obtained grants and issuances of patents on mrna medicines and our delivery technology the issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in key markets around the world that we own claim many different methods compositions and processes relating to the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of mrna medicines and our delivery technology including lnps 

as the field of mrna therapeutics and vaccines is maturing patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world there is uncertainty about which patents will issue and if they do as to when to whom and with what claims it is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings such as interference reexamination and opposition proceedings as well as inter partes and postgrant review proceedings introduced by provisions of the america invents act which became available to thirdparty challengers on september 16 2012 in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mrna field an opposition has been filed against one of our european platform patents covering uridinemodified mrnas and we expect that further oppositions will 

be filed in the european patent office epo and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio in many cases the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents and it may be years before final unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions the timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims we cannot be certain that such patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form in addition third parties may attempt to invalidate our ip rights even if our rights are not directly challenged disputes could lead to the weakening of our ip rights our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our ip rights could be costly to us could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the field of mrna therapeutics 

there are many issued and pending thirdparty patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide delivery technologies that we may need for our mrna therapeutic and vaccine candidates or marketed products including our covid19 vaccine if approved there are also many issued thirdparty patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for mrna medicines we wish to develop for example there may be issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party’s belief that we may need such patents for our mrna therapeutic candidates thus it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we may need a license or hold patent rights which could be asserted against us if those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have been asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms we may be unable to perform research and development or other activities or market products including our covid19 vaccine covered by such patents 

if we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights we could incur substantial costs and expenses substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts 

our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties there is a substantial amount of litigation both within and outside the united states involving patent and other ip rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including patent infringement lawsuits interferences oppositions ex parte reexaminations postgrant review and inter partes review proceedings before the us patent and trademark office uspto and corresponding foreign patent offices numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications which are owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates in certain instances we have instituted and may in the future institute inter partes review proceedings against issued us patents and opposition proceedings against european patents owned by third parties in the field of mrna medicines we have a number of these proceedings ongoing against thirdparty patents related to rna vaccinations and mrna delivery if we are unsuccessful in invalidating certain of the thirdparty patents that we are currently challenging those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against us should certain of our investigational medicines obtain regulatory approval as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued the risk increases that our development candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties 

third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization there may be thirdparty patents or patent applications with claims to materials formulations methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our investigational medicines because patent applications can take many years to issue there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our investigational medicines may infringe in addition third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our investigational medicines any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself the holders of any such patents may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such investigational medicine unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire similarly if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations processes for manufacture or methods of use including combination therapy the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable investigational medicine unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires in either case such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

defense of infringement and other claims regardless of their merit would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement pay royalties redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms if at all or may require substantial time and expense 

in addition such licenses are likely to be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us if we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent 

us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations moreover we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our ip may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior ip positions in the relevant fields which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations 

in addition in connection with certain license and strategic alliance agreements we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to ip rights or the subject matter of the agreements the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to ip rights even if resolved in our favor could be substantial and litigation would divert our management’s efforts some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research development and commercialization efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations 

we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary ip rights to product components and manufacturing processes for our development pipeline 

presently we have rights to certain ip through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own to develop our development candidates and investigational medicines because our pipeline may involve additional development candidates that could require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties the growth of our business could depend in part on our ability to acquire inlicense or use these proprietary rights in addition our development candidates and investigational medicines may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others we may be unable to acquire or inlicense any compositions methods of use processes or other thirdparty ip rights from third parties that we identify the licensing and acquisition of thirdparty ip rights is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire thirdparty ip rights that we may consider attractive these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities 

for example we sometimes collaborate with us and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions typically these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration regardless of such right of first negotiation for ip we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us if we are unable to do so the institution may offer the ip rights to other parties potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program 

in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we also may be unable to license or acquire thirdparty ip rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required thirdparty ip rights our business financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer 

if we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries our ability to effectively compete using our development candidates will be harmed 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other ip laws of the united states and other countries so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information however we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to develop manufacture and commercialize our proposed products 

because certain us patent applications are confidential until the patents issue such as applications filed prior to november 29 2000 or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications in addition publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries and patent applications in the united states and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or in some cases not at all therefore we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending patent applications or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions including our covid19 vaccine 

for this and other reasons we may be unable to secure desired patent rights thereby losing exclusivity further we may be required to obtain licenses under thirdparty patents to market our proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities if licenses are not available to us on favorable terms we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities 

our strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries in addition we may rely on thirdparty strategic collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly as a part of certain strategic alliances the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming if our present or future strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely 

manner our business may be adversely affected despite our efforts and the efforts of our strategic collaborators to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary while issued patents are presumed valid this does not guarantee that the patent will survive a validity challenge or be held enforceable any patents we have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged invalidated adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by parties attempting to design around our ip moreover third parties or the uspto may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications any challenge to finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention of our patents or patent applications would be costly would require significant time and attention of our management could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from thirdparty licensors and could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents the patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies including ours is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations the standards that the uspto and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change similarly the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions including ours in the united states and foreign countries remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices courts and lawmakers moreover there are periodic discussions in the us congress and in international jurisdictions about modifying various aspects of patent law for example the america invents act which took effect in march 2013 included a number of changes to the patent laws of the united states if any of the enacted changes prevent us from adequately protecting our discoveries including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents to obtain injunctive relieve or for substantial damages our business could be adversely affected one major provision of the america invents act changed us patent practice from a firsttoinvent to a firsttofile system if we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor’s filing date and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention there is also no uniform worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents in certain countries for example methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable 

accordingly we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others we also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets knowhow and technology which are not protected by patents to maintain our competitive position if any trade secret knowhow or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

failure to obtain and maintain all available regulatory exclusivities and broad patent scope and to maximize patent term restoration or extension on patents covering our products may lead to loss of exclusivity and early biosimilar entry resulting in a loss of market share andor revenue 

in addition we may choose not to enforce our intellectual property rights in certain circumstances or for certain periods of time for example in october 2020 we announced that while the covid19 pandemic continues we will not enforce our covid19 related patents against those making vaccines intended to combat the pandemic we also noted that to eliminate any perceived intellectual property barriers to vaccine development during the pandemic period upon request we are also willing to license our intellectual property for covid19 vaccines to others for the post pandemic period however we may never enter into such licenses of our intellectual property for the postpandemic period and our business may be otherwise adversely impacted by our decision not to enforce this intellectual property during the pandemic 

we license patent rights from thirdparty owners if such owners do not properly or successfully obtain maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we are a party to licenses that give us rights to thirdparty ip that is necessary or useful for our business in particular we have obtained licenses from cellscript llc and its affiliates to patent rights covering modified mrna chemistries and from certain other parties for ip useful in our formulation efforts we may enter into additional licenses to thirdparty ip in the future 

our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed ip our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications we license even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications our licensors may fail to maintain these patents may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would without protection for the ip we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects in addition we sublicense our rights under various thirdparty licenses to our strategic collaborators any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our strategic alliance agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our strategic collaborators 

if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license ip rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

licensing of ip is important to our business and involves complex legal business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry we are a party to certain ip license agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future our existing license agreements impose and we expect that future license agreements will impose various diligence milestone payment royalty and other obligations on us if we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or we are subject to a bankruptcy the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license 

in some cases patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor if our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary ip we license from them we could lose our rights to the ip and our competitors could market competing products using the ip in certain cases we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology in the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution we may incur significant liability to our strategic collaborators disputes may arise regarding ip subject to a licensing agreement including 

• the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretationrelated issues 

• the extent to which our technology and processes that are not subject to the licensing agreement infringe on ip of the licensor 

• the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships 

• our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations 

• the ownership of inventions and knowhow resulting from the joint creation or use of ip by our licensors and us and our strategic collaborators and 

• the priority of invention of patented technology 

if disputes over ip that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected development candidates or investigational medicines we are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of ip that we license as we are for ip that we own which are described below if we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this ip our ability to commercialize products could suffer 

if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position would be harmed 

in addition to patent protection we rely heavily upon knowhow and trade secret protection as well as nondisclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and third parties to protect our confidential and proprietary information especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable in addition to contractual measures we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures such measures may not for example in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access provide adequate protection for our proprietary information our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult expensive and timeconsuming and the outcome is unpredictable in addition trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us if any of our confidential or proprietary information such as our trade secrets were to be disclosed or misappropriated or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor our competitive position could be harmed 

certain former employees have obtained employment with companies or academic institutions that could be considered competitive with us and are operating their business in areas that are similar to ours including in their business model product discovery efforts mrnabased product development or formulation technology such as our lnps this competition may be limited by contractual provisions which may or may not be enforceable by us in the commonwealth of massachusetts or other jurisdictions in addition we may not be aware of such competitive employment arrangements until after our trade secrets have been disclosed to potentially competitive companies 

we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 

we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors although we try to ensure that our employees consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or knowhow of others in their work for us from time to time we are subject to claims that we or our employees consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed ip including trade secrets or 

other proprietary information of any of our employees’ former employers or other third parties litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights or personnel which could adversely impact our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other ip 

we may be subject to claims that former employees collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other ip ownership disputes may arise for example from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our development candidates litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights such as exclusive ownership of or right to use valuable ip such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements 

it is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist or may arise in the future for example with respect to proper priority claims inventorship claim scope or requests for patent term adjustments if we fail to establish maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights such rights may be reduced or eliminated if there are material defects in the form preparation prosecution or enforcement of our patents or patent applications such patents may be invalid andor unenforceable and such applications may never result in valid enforceable patents any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties which may have an adverse impact on our business 

periodic maintenance fees renewal fees annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents or applications will be due to be paid to the uspto and various governmental patent agencies outside of the united states in several stages over the lifetime of the patents or applications we have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to nonus patent agencies the uspto and various nonus governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules however there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction in such an event our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could have a material adverse impact on our business 

issued patents covering our development candidates and investigational medicines could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court 

if we or one of our strategic collaborators initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our development candidates or investigational medicines the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our development candidate or investigational medicine is invalid or unenforceable in patent litigation in the united states defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements including patent eligible subject matter lack of novelty obviousness or nonenablement grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the uspto or made a misleading statement during prosecution third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the united states or abroad even outside the context of litigation such mechanisms include reexamination postgrant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions eg opposition proceedings such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our development candidates or investigational medicines the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable with respect to the validity question for example there may be invalidating prior art that we and the patent examiner were unaware of during prosecution if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity andor unenforceability we would lose at least part of the patent protection for our development candidates and investigational medicines such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business 

changes in us patent and regulatory law could impair our ability to protect our products 

as is the case with other biotechnology companies our success is heavily dependent on ip particularly patents obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity and therefore obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly timeconsuming and inherently uncertain in addition the united states has enacted and is implementing wideranging patent reform legislation recent us supreme court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained depending on decisions by the us congress the federal courts and the uspto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future furthermore depending on the supreme court’s review of the aca or legislation to repeal or amend the aca the twelve years of regulatory exclusivity currently provided to certain biologic products in the united states may be reduced or eliminated as further discussed above under the risk factor entitled “our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway” any such reduction or elimination could impair the length of exclusivity against biosimilar products 

we may not be able to protect our ip rights throughout the world 

filing prosecuting and defending patents on development candidates and investigational medicines in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our ip rights in some countries outside the united states can be less extensive than those in the united states in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ip rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the united states consequently we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the united states or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the united states or other jurisdictions competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the united states these products may compete with our products and our patents or other ip rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing 

many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending ip rights in foreign jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other ip protection particularly those relating to biotechnology products which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our ip rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the ip that we develop or license 

many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties as a result in response to the covid19 pandemic it is possible that certain countries may take steps to facilitate compulsory licenses that permit the distribution of a covid19 vaccine in those countries in addition many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors in these countries the patent owner may have limited remedies which could materially diminish the value of the relevant patent rights if we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business our competitive position may be impaired and our business financial condition results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected 

our reliance on government funding and collaboration from governmental and quasigovernmental entities for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of development commercialization and production of any programs developed under those governmentfunded programs 

the development of each of our zika vaccine mrna1893 our antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 and our chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 are currently being funded through subcontracts with funding from either barda or darpa our covid19 vaccine is being developed in collaboration with niaid barda has agreed to fund the advancement of our covid19 vaccine to fda licensure contracts and grants funded by the us government and its agencies including our agreements funded by barda and darpa and our collaboration with niaid include provisions that reflect the government’s substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts including powers of the government to 

• terminate agreements in whole or in part for any reason or no reason 

• reduce or modify the government’s obligations under such agreements without the consent of the other party 

• claim rights including ip rights in products and data developed under such agreements 

• audit contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs 

• suspend the contractor or grantee from receiving new contracts pending resolution of alleged violations of procurement laws or regulations 

• impose us manufacturing requirements for products that embody inventions conceived or first reduced to practice under such agreements 

• suspend or debar the contractor or grantee from doing future business with the government 

• control and potentially prohibit the export of products 

• pursue criminal or civil remedies under the false claims act false statements act and similar remedy provisions specific to government agreements and 

• limit the government’s financial liability to amounts appropriated by the us congress on a fiscalyear basis thereby leaving some uncertainty about the future availability of funding for a program even after it has been funded for an initial period 

we may not have the right to prohibit the us government from using certain technologies developed by us and we may not be able to prohibit thirdparty companies including our competitors from using those technologies in providing products and services to the us government the us government generally takes the position that it has the right to royaltyfree use of technologies that are developed under us government contracts 

in addition government contracts and grants and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions these requirements include for example 

• specialized accounting systems unique to government contracts and grants 

• mandatory financial audits and potential liability for price adjustments or recoupment of government funds after such funds have been spent 

• public disclosures of certain contract and grant information which may enable competitors to gain insights into our research program and 

• mandatory socioeconomic compliance requirements including labor standards nondiscrimination and affirmative action programs and environmental compliance requirements 

further under these agreements we are subject to the obligations to and the rights of the us government set forth in the bayhdole act of 1980 bayhdole act as a result the us government may have rights in certain inventions developed under these governmentfunded programs including a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us to grant exclusive partially exclusive or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that i adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention ii government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or iii government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations also referred to as “marchin rights” while the us government has sparingly used and to our knowledge never successfully exercised such marchin rights any exercise of the marchin rights by the us government could harm our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and prospects if the us government exercises such marchin rights we may receive compensation that is deemed reasonable by the us government in its sole discretion which may be less than what we might be able to obtain in the open market intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources 

in addition the us government requires that any products embodying any invention generated through the use of us government funding be manufactured substantially in the united states the manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the united states or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible this preference for us manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with nonus manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property 

as an organization we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails if we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts 

as a us government contractor we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the us government of our costs and performance on their contracts as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts based on the results of its audits the government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs although adjustments arising from government audits and reviews have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past we cannot assure you that future audits and reviews will not have those effects 

the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations is a global organization that has publicly stated its intent to work with multiple global organizations on potential vaccines and therapies targeting the novel coronavirus including other companies working on mrna based approaches there is a possibility that our confidential information may become exposed to others during this process including the details and timing of our vaccine efforts 

risks related to the commercialization of our pipeline 

we have limited sales distribution and marketing experience and have only recently invested significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities as a result of our rapid development and commercialization of our covid19 vaccine if we are unable to effectively establish such capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our products or to help ensure compliance with local regulatory requirements our ability to generate revenues may be adversely affected 

our covid19 vaccine mrna1273 represents the first product that we have commercialized for sales distribution and marketing to enable the successful commercialization of this vaccine and other products that may result from our development programs we are investing in the development of sales marketing distribution managerial and other nontechnical capabilities in the united states europe and other regions both on our own and with others we may enter into strategic alliances with other entities to utilize their mature marketing and distribution capabilities but we may be unable to enter into marketing agreements on favorable terms if at all to the extent that we rely on third parties to commercialize our approved products if any w e will receive lower revenues th an if we commercialized these products ourselves in addition we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of third parties involved in our commercialization efforts if our future strategic collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products if any and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business we are and will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and wellfunded marketing and sales operations in the event that we develop our own marketing or sales force we will also have to compete with such companies to recruit hire train and retain marketing and sales personnel without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 

the commercialization and distribution of our covid19 vaccine also subjects us to pharmacovigilance obligations under various regulatory regimes in the jurisdictions in which our vaccine is distributed under these regulations we are generally required to collect process analyze and monitor safety data and to identify and evaluate adverse reactions to our covid19 vaccine as it is administered in those jurisdictions we partner with third party organizations to assist us in collecting and processing this safety data as it is reported from healthcare providers recipients of our vaccine and others to the extent that we or the third parties with whom we contract to conduct these pharmacovigilance activities are unable to comply with relevant regulations including with respect to the timely processing of safety data we may be subject to sanctions increased costs reputational harm or our authorizations to distribute the covid19 vaccine in the relevant jurisdictions may be revoked or curtailed there are a limited number of thirdparty service providers who are qualified and capable of providing pharmacovigilance services on a global basis and our inability to identify or contract with qualified service providers may impede our commercial activities 

we are and will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and wellfunded marketing sales and pharmacovigilance operations in the event that we develop our own marketing or sales force we will also have to compete with such companies to recruit hire train and retain marketing and sales personnel we have and will continue to incur expenses associated with hiring thirdparty contractors to assist in conducting local pharmacovigilance services without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform these functions we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 

certain of our customers for our covid19 vaccine prepay us for a portion of the product payment for the vaccine doses that they expect to receive from us and under the terms of certain of our supply agreements we may be required to refund some or all of those prepayments if a customer reduces its purchase commitment or if we fail to deliver the purchased volume 

certain of our customers for our covid19 vaccine prepay us for a portion of the product payment for the vaccine doses that they expect to receive from us in some cases this prepayment can be substantial we are generally not required by our contracts to retain these prepayments in cash or otherwise and we have generally used these prepayments to make capital expenditures and fund the manufacturing scaleup and commercialization of our vaccine under certain supply agreements with customers for our covid19 vaccine if we fail to deliver a portion or all of the committed number of doses by a certain date a customer may reduce the volume of vaccine doses that it commits to purchase or the contract may be terminated upon termination by the customer we would generally be required to refund a portion of that customer’s prepayment we may not have the cash or other available resources to satisfy that repayment obligation even if we are able to satisfy the repayment obligation from available resources we may need to seek additional sources of capital to fund our operations which funding may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms in either of those circumstances our business financial condition results of operations and reputation could be materially and adversely affected furthermore in the future customers may elect not to prepay us for our services in which case we would have to find other sources of funding for our capital expenditures and operations which may not be available when needed or on acceptable terms 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products new treatment methods and new technologies we may be unable to commercialize successfully any products that we develop 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel products for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target many of our competitors have 

• greater financial technical and human resources than we have at every stage of the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of products 

• more extensive experience in preclinical testing conducting clinical trials obtaining regulatory approvals and in manufacturing marketing and selling products 

• investigational medicines that are based on previously tested or accepted technologies 

• products that have been approved or are in late stages of development and 

• collaborative arrangements in our target markets with leading companies and research institutions 

we will face intense competition from products that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of the conditions for which we may develop products for example we announced in september 2020 that we plan to develop a vaccine for the seasonal flu although we believe there is an unmet need for a highly effective seasonal flu vaccine this is a welldeveloped market and we may not be successful in either developing a successful product or achieving a market share for our product that justifies our investment we also expect to face competition from new products that enter the market there are a number of products currently under development which may become commercially available in the future for the treatment of conditions for which we are trying or may in the future try to develop products these products may be more effective safer less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we develop while we believe that our covid19 vaccine has and will continue to have a competitive profile it is possible it will not compete favorably with these products and product candidates or others and as a result we may not achieve commercial success moreover positive data andor the commercial success of competitive products could negatively impact our stock price 

we anticipate competing with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world many of which are all currently conducting research in the fields of infectious diseases immunooncology rare genetic diseases and cancer vaccines some of these companies have greater financial and human resources than we currently have in addition to these large pharmaceutical companies we may directly compete with fullyintegrated biopharmaceutical companies and other immunotherapyfocused oncology companies as well as a number of companies focused on mrna medicines or shared tumor antigen and neoantigen therapeutics some of which have entered into collaboration and funding agreements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 

if we successfully develop investigational medicines and obtain approval for them we will face competition based on many different factors including 

• the safety and effectiveness of our products relative to alternative therapies if any 

• the ease with which our products can be administered and the extent to which patients accept relatively new routes of administration 

• the timing and scope of regulatory approvals for these products 

• the availability and cost of manufacturing marketing and sales capabilities 

• the price of any approved mrna medicine 

• reimbursement coverage and 

• patent position 

our competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors in addition our competitors may develop strategic alliances with or receive funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies providing them with an advantage over us our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are which could adversely affect our competitive position and business competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our products if approved 

the commercial success of any current or future investigational medicine if approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community 

ethical social and legal concerns about genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use even with the requisite approvals the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the medical community patients and thirdparty or governmental payors accepting mrna medicines in general and our products in particular as medically useful costeffective and safe any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians trial participants patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community if these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable the degree of market acceptance of our investigational medicines if approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors including 

• the potential efficacy and potential advantages over alternative treatments 

• the ability to offer our products if approved at competitive prices 

• the prevalence and severity of any side effects including any limitations or warnings contained in a product’s approved labeling 

• the prevalence and severity of any side effects resulting from checkpoint inhibitors or other products or therapies with which our products are coadministered 

• relative convenience and ease of administration 

• any restrictions on the use of our products if approved together with other medications 

• the willingness of the target patient population to try new therapies and of physicians to prescribe these therapies 

• the strength of marketing and distribution support and timing of market introduction of competitive products 

• publicity concerning our products or competing products and treatments and 

• sufficient thirdparty insurance coverage or reimbursement and patients’ willingness to pay outofpocket in the absence of thirdparty coverage or adequate reimbursement 

even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical studies and clinical trials market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched our efforts to educate the medical community and thirdparty payors on the benefits of the products may require significant resources and may never be successful our efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors due to the complexity and uniqueness of our programs 

even if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval for any product commercial success of any approved products will also depend in large part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors including government payors such as the medicare and medicaid programs and entry into managed care organizations which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of healthcare thirdparty payors could require us to conduct additional studies including postmarketing studies related to the cost effectiveness of a product to qualify for reimbursement which could be costly and divert our resources if government and other healthcare payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for any of our products once approved whether due to healthcare reform legislation or otherwise market acceptance and commercial success would be reduced 

in addition if any of our products are approved for marketing we or a strategic collaborator will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other postmarketing information and reports for such product and will need to continue to comply or ensure that our thirdparty providers comply with cgmp and current gcps for any clinical trials that we or a strategic collaborator conduct postapproval in addition there is always the risk that we or a strategic collaborator or regulatory authority might identify previously unknown problems with a product postapproval such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency compliance with these requirements is costly and any such failure to comply or other issues with our investigational medicines identified postapproval could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we will need to obtain fda approval of any proposed product names and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business 

any name we intend to use for our proposed products will require approval from the fda regardless of whether we have secured a trademark registration from the uspto the fda typically conducts a review of proposed product names including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names the fda may object to any product name we submit if it believes the name inappropriately implies medical claims if the fda objects to any of our proposed product names we may be required to adopt an alternative name for our proposed products if we adopt an alternative name we would lose the benefit of any existing trademark applications for such developmental candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the fda we may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all which would limit our ability to commercialize our products if approved 

we market our products outside of the united states and we are subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

because we market our covid19 vaccine and we plan to market any other products if approved outside of the united states our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including an increase in our expenses diversion of our management’s attention from the acquisition or development of investigational medicines or forgoing profitable licensing opportunities in these geographies we are not permitted to market or promote any of our developmental candidates or investigational medicines before we receive regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory authority in that foreign market and we may never receive such regulatory approval for any of our developmental candidates or investigational medicines to obtain separate regulatory approval in many other countries we must comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of such countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing among other things clinical trials manufacturing commercial sales pricing and distribution of our developmental candidates and investigational medicines and we cannot predict success in these jurisdictions we are rapidly expanding our global operations and thirdparty arrangements to support the worldwide manufacture and distribution of our covid19 vaccine which is a complex task that we are undertaking on an accelerated timeline accordingly our business and financial results may be adversely affected due to a variety of factors associated with our expanding global business including 

• efforts to develop an international commercial sales marketing and supply chain and distribution organization including efforts to mitigate longer accounts receivable collection times longer lead times for shipping and potential language barriers 

• our customers’ ability to obtain reimbursement for our products in foreign markets 

• our inability to directly control commercial activities because we are relying on third parties 

• different medical practices and customs in foreign countries affecting acceptance in the marketplace 

• changes in a specific country’s or region’s political and cultural climate or economic condition including as a result of the covid19 pandemic 

• increased legal and compliance burden associated with establishing maintaining and operating legal entities in foreign countries 

• the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory tax accounting and legal requirements including the european general data protection regulation 2016679 or gdpr 

• the interpretation of contractual provisions governed by foreign laws in the event of a contract dispute and the difficulty of effective enforcement of contractual provisions in local jurisdictions and the existence of potentially relevant thirdparty ip rights 

• inadequate ip protection in foreign countries and the existence of potentially relevant thirdparty ip rights 

• tradeprotection measures including trade restrictions import or export licensing requirements such as export administration regulations promulgated by the us department of commerce and fines penalties or suspension or revocation of export privileges the imposition of government controls and changes in tariffs 

• the effects of applicable foreign tax structures and potentially adverse tax consequences and 

• significant adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements in the united states and abroad we are subject to extensive additional federal state and foreign antibribery regulations which include the us foreign corrupt practices act fcpa the uk bribery act and similar laws in other countries outside of the united states 

the fcpa prohibits any us individual or business from paying offering authorizing payment or offering anything of value directly or indirectly to any foreign official political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business the fcpa also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the united states to comply with certain accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation including international subsidiaries and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations 

compliance with the fcpa is expensive and difficult particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem in addition the fcpa presents particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry because in many countries hospitals are operated by the government and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials certain payments to hospitals in connection with clinical trials and other work have been deemed to be improper payments to government officials and have led to fcpa enforcement actions various laws regulations and executive orders also restrict the use and dissemination outside the united states or the sharing with certain nonus nationals of information classified for national security purposes as well as certain products and technical data relating to those products as we expand our presence outside the united states it will require us to dedicate additional resources to comply with these laws and these laws may preclude us from developing manufacturing or selling certain products and product candidates outside the united states which could limit our growth potential and increase our development costs 

we are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry for companies similar to ours but we cannot guarantee that we our employees our consultants or our thirdparty contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption moreover our strategic collaborators and thirdparty contractors located outside the united states may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate the failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting the sec also may suspend or bar issuers from trading securities on us exchanges for violations of the fcpa’s accounting provisions even if we are not determined to have violated these laws government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity which could also have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newlyapproved products particularly in a new class of medicines is uncertain failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue 

the availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments such as the medicines that we hope to develop and sell adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance in addition because our personalized cancer vaccine and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer we cannot accurately estimate how these products would be priced whether reimbursement could be obtained or any potential revenue sales of our investigational medicines will depend substantially both domestically and abroad on the extent to which the costs of our investigational medicines will be paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels we may not be able to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment in any of our products in the us we may establish various programs to help patients afford our products which may include patient assistance programs and copay coupon programs for eligible patients 

there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products including genetic medicines and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities thirdparty payors decide which medications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels in the united states the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the centers for medicare  medicaid services cms an agency within the us department of health and human services hhs as cms decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under medicare private payors tend to follow cms to a substantial degree it is difficult to predict what cms will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours factors payors consider in determining reimbursement are based on whether the product is 

• a covered benefit under its health plan 

• safe effective and medically necessary 

• appropriate for the specific patient 

• costeffective and 

• neither experimental nor investigational 

in the united states no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among thirdparty payors therefore coverage and reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payor to payor the process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product thirdparty payors may also limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or 

formulary which might not include all of the fdaapproved products for a particular indication net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors many thirdparty payors are also increasingly requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products furthermore many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government such as average sales price asp and best price penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely we cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for or accurately estimate the potential revenue from our product candidates or assure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we may develop 

a decision by a thirdparty payor not to cover or not to separately reimburse for our medical products or therapies using our products could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved assuming there is coverage for our product candidates or therapies using our product candidates by a thirdparty payor the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require copayments that patients find unacceptably high we cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the united states will be available for our current or future product candidates or for any procedures using such product candidates and any reimbursement that may become available may not be adequate or may be decreased or eliminated in the future 

coverage and reimbursement of our covid19 vaccine which was recently granted eua may be subject to unique regulatory policies under the aca preventive care mandate nongrandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage offered in the individual or group market typically have at least one year before it must provide firstdollar coverage for a newly issued preventive care requirement or guideline however pursuant to the cares act nongrandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage offered in the individual or group market must cover any qualifying coronavirus preventive service 15 business days after the united states preventive services task force or advisory committee on immunization practices acip designates such service as preventive on december 19 2020 acip voted 11–0 in favor of the interim recommendation for use of the moderna covid19 vaccine currently third party payors do not offer coverage or reimbursement for the vaccine however thirdparty reimbursement for providers administering our covid19 vaccine may affect market acceptance of the product currently the cares act and its implementing regulations state i providers that participate in the cdc covid19 vaccination program must administer a covid19 immunization regardless of an individual’s ability to pay or health insurance coverage status ii providers may not seek any reimbursement including through balance billing from an immunization recipient iii that coverage is required without costsharing for the administration of the immunization even if a third party such as the federal government pays for the cost of the immunization and that iv private health insurance plans must cover covid19 immunizations and their administration even when provided by outofnetwork providers for the duration of the public health emergency for covid19 

there is no guarantee payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our covid19 vaccine during or after the termination of the public health emergency nor can we guarantee that even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount will be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment the fda may revoke eua of mrna1273 or may not approve the bla if submitted under the cares act and an accompanying interim final rule medicare beneficiaries are expected to have coverage for covid19 vaccines through medicare part b with no cost sharing coverage is further expected to apply whether the vaccine receives fda authorization through an eua or is licensed under a bla and will likely extend to employersponsored and individual health plans subject to the aca’s preventive services standards the outcome of current and future clinical trials as well as the market demand for covid19 vaccines may impact patient eligibility and current and future coverage determinations it is unclear whether the fda will approve the administration of our covid19 vaccine for patients under eighteen years of age or if the vaccine will be required to be administered once ie onetime double dose annually or if future booster shots will be required we cannot predict continued prevalence of covid19 whether herd immunity will be achieved which would affect the need for future administration of the vaccine or whether mrna1273 will be effective against future mutations or variants of the sarscov2 virus such factors may impact if mrna1273 shall be reimbursable under medicare part d rather than part b and if mrna1273 will be excluded from participating in certain federal entitlement programs such as the vaccines for children program 

reimbursement agencies in europe may be more conservative than cms for example a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the united states and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain european countries outside the united states certain countries including a number of member states of the european union set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the european union with limited participation from the marketing authorization holders we cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic collaborators if the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement levels that are not commercially attractive for us or our strategic collaborators our revenues from sales by us or our strategic collaborators and the potential profitability of our drug products in those countries would be negatively affected an increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing costcutting efforts on pharmaceuticals for their staterun healthcare systems these international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world but have been most drastic in the european union additionally some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed in many countries the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted as a result we might obtain 

marketing approval for a product in a particular country but then may experience delays in the reimbursement approval of our product or be subject to price regulations that would delay our commercial launch of the product possibly for lengthy time periods which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country 

moreover payment methodologies may be subject to changes in healthcare legislation and regulatory initiatives for example cms may develop new payment and delivery models such as bundled payment models recently there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their products resulting in several recent us congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to among other things bring more transparency to drug pricing reduce the cost of prescription drugs under medicare review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs for example at the federal level the us government’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a 135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices increase competition lower outofpocket drug costs for patients and increase patient access to lowercost generic and biosimilar drugs on march 10 2020 the us government sent “principles” for drug pricing to congress calling for legislation that would among other things cap medicare part d beneficiary outofpocket pharmacy expenses provide an option to cap medicare part d beneficiary monthly outofpocket expenses and place limits on pharmaceutical price increases 

additionally the us government previously released a “blueprint” to reduce the cost of drugs this blueprint contains certain measures that the hhs is already working to implement for example in may 2019 cms issued a final rule that amends the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs among other things the final rule now allows medicare advantage plans the option to use step therapy a type of preauthorization for part b drugs beginning january 1 2020 this final rule codified cms’s policy change that was effective january 1 2019 in addition there have been several changes to the 340b drug pricing program which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities some of these changes are undergoing legal challenges and their status is currently in question it is unclear how these developments could affect covered hospitals who might purchase our future products and affect the rates we may charge such facilities for our approved products in the future if any 

on july 24 2020 and september 13 2020 former president trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at lowering drug prices and at implementing several of the administrations proposals in response the fda released a final rule on september 24 2020 which went into effect on november 30 2020 creating a process for states to build and submit to the fda importation plans for drugs from canada further on november 20 2020 cms issued an interim final rule implementing the most favored nation or mfn model under which medicare part b reimbursement rates will be calculated for certain drugs and biologicals based on the lowest price drug manufacturers receive in organization for economic cooperation and development countries with a similar gross domestic product per capita the mfn model regulations mandate participation by identified part b providers and was intended to apply in all us states and territories for a sevenyear period beginning january 1 2021 and ending december 31 2027 however on december 28 2020 a judge in the us district court for the northern district of california granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting cms from implementing the mfn model additionally on november 20 2020 hhs finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under part d either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers unless the price reduction is required by law the rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the pointofsale as well as a safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers pursuant to an order entered by the us district court for the district of columbia the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under medicare part d has been delayed to january 1 2023 implementation of the this change and new safe harbors for pointofsale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the biden administration and may be amended or repealed although a number of these and other proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective and the biden administration may reverse or otherwise change these measures congress has indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative measures to control drug costs 

at the state level legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts or restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures which in some cases are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by thirdparty payors or other restrictions on coverage or access could harm our business results of operations financial condition and prospects in addition regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs this could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates that we successfully commercialize or put pressure on our product pricing 

we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our investigational medicines due to the trend toward managed healthcare the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes the downward 

pressure on healthcare costs in general particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments has become very intense as a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products 

recent federal legislation and actions by federal state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the united states including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the united states which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

we may face competition in the united states for our development candidates and investigational medicines if approved from therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products in the united states the medicare modernization act contains provisions that call for the promulgation of regulations that expand pharmacists’ and wholesalers’ ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from canada where there are government price controls further the medicare modernization act provides that these changes to us importation laws will not take effect unless and until the secretary of hhs certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public’s health and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers on september 23 2020 the secretary of hhs made such certification to congress and on october 1 2020 the fda published a final rule that allows for the importation of certain prescription drugs from canada under the final rule states and indian tribes and in certain future circumstances pharmacists and wholesalers may submit importation program proposals to the fda for review and authorization since the issuance of the final rule several industry groups have filed federal lawsuits challenging multiple aspects of the final rule and authorities in canada have passed rules designed to safeguard the canadian drug supply from shortages on september 25 2020 cms stated drugs imported by states under this rule will not be eligible for federal rebates under section 1927 of the social security act and manufacturers would not report these drugs for “best price” or average manufacturer price purposes since these drugs are not considered covered outpatient drugs cms further stated it will not publish a national average drug acquisition cost for these drugs separately the fda also issued a final guidance document outlining a pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional national drug code ndc for an fdaapproved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country since the issuance of the final rule on november 23 2020 several industry groups filed federal lawsuits in the us district court for the district of columbia requesting injunctive relief to prevent certification from the secretary of hhs from taking effect and challenging multiple aspects of the final rule this litigation has not progressed if implemented drug importation may materially and adversely affect the price we receive for any of our products and product candidates the market implications of these rules and guidance are unknown at this time for example proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs if enacted could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability 

healthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business 

in the united states there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs for example in march 2010 the aca was passed which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical industry the aca among other things increased the minimum medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and promoted a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program considerable uncertainty remains regarding the implementation and impact of the aca 

since its enactment there have been numerous judicial administrative executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future various portions of the aca are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the united states supreme court the trump administration issued various executive orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices and congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the aca the united states supreme court is expected to rule on a legal challenge to the constitutionality of the aca in early 2021 the implementation of the aca is ongoing the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing especially under the medicare program and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs litigation and legislation related to the aca are likely to continue with unpredictable and uncertain results it is unclear whether the aca will be overturned repealed replaced or further amended we cannot predict what affect further changes to the aca would have on our business 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things created measures for spending reductions by the us congress a joint select committee on deficit reduction tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 was unable to reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this 

includes aggregate reductions of medicare payments to providers up to 2 per fiscal year these reductions will remain in effect through 2030 unless additional congressional action is taken however pursuant to the cares act and subsequent legislation these medicare sequester reductions will be suspended from may 1 2020 through march 31 2021 due to the covid19 pandemic proposed legislation if passed would extend this suspension until the end of the covid19 pandemic on january 2 2013 the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 was signed into law which among other things further reduced medicare payments to several types of providers including hospitals and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years additionally the bipartisan budget act of 2018 among other things amended the aca effective january 1 2019 by increasing the pointofsale discount from 50 under the aca to 70 that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in medicare part d and closing the coverage gap in most medicare drug plans commonly referred to as the “donut hole” 

throughout the covid19 pandemic there has been public concern over the availability and accessibility of critical medical products and the cares act enhances fda’s existing authority with respect to drug shortage measures under the cares act we must have in place a risk management plan that identifies and evaluates the risks to the supply of approved drugs for certain serious diseases or conditions for each establishment where the drug or api is manufactured the risk management plan will be subject to fda review during an inspection if we experience shortages in the supply of our marketed products our results could be materially impacted 

further legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand postapproval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products we cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether fda regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals if any of our development candidates may be in addition increased scrutiny by the us congress of the fda’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and postmarketing conditions and other requirements 

the delivery of healthcare in the european union including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines is almost exclusively a matter for national rather than eu law and policy national governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context in general however the healthcare budgetary constraints in most eu member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers coupled with everincreasing eu and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval 

we expect that additional foreign state and federal healthcare reform measures or proposals will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our investigational medicines or additional pricing pressures in the event that the pricing structures for healthcare products such as the investigational medicines we are developing change materially and limit payments for such investigational medicines our business will be adversely impacted as our products may no longer be commercially viable based on their expected net present value we may have invested significant resources in products that cannot be commercially developed or we may determine that assets that have reached an early phase of development cannot or will not be taken into further development notwithstanding their clinical viability in addition development assets or clinical programs that are part of our strategic alliances may no longer be deemed commercially viable to pursue based on our strategic collaborators’ assessments of the impact of any proposed announced or legislated pricing reforms 

we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future further federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from investigational medicines that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop investigational medicines 

due to the novel nature of our technology we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement for these investigational medicines 

target patient populations for certain of our investigational medicines such as those for rare genetic diseases may be relatively small and certain of our investigational medicines like pcv require customization on an individual scale as a result the pricing and reimbursement of our investigational medicines if approved must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure if we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement our ability to successfully market and sell our investigational medicines will be adversely affected the manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our investigational medicines eg for administration of our product to patients is also important inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products 

in addition thirdparty payor coverage for our covid19 vaccine is not currently available and there is no guarantee payors will provide coverage for the vaccine during or after the termination of the public health emergency we cannot guarantee that even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount will be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment while coverage will most likely be provided under medicare part b it is unclear whether such coverage may be redesignated to part b and it is further unclear to what extent other payors including certain federal entitlement programs such as the vaccines for children program will provide coverage for the product 

if the market opportunities for our development candidates or investigational medicines are smaller than we believe they are our revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer because the target patient populations for some of our programs are difficult to ascertain or small we must be able to successfully identify clinical trial participants and achieve a significant market share to maintain profitability and growth 

an important area of focus of our research and product development activities is the development of treatments for severe rare genetic diseases our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our programs are based on estimates these estimates have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature surveys of clinics patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect further new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases the number of clinical trial participants or patients in the united states europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected potential clinical trial participants or patients may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products or new clinical trial participants or patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business 

the market opportunities of some of our programs may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and for which the market opportunities may be small 

the fda often approves new therapies initially only for use by patients with relapsed or refractory advanced disease we expect to initially seek approval of our pcv and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines in this context subsequently for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial if any we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy but there is no guarantee that our investigational medicines even if approved would be approved for earlier lines of therapy and prior to any such approvals we may have to conduct additional clinical trials 

our projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we may be targeting as well as the subset of people with these cancers in a position to receive second or third line therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our investigational medicines are based on our beliefs and estimates these estimates have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature surveys of clinics patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect further new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers the number of trial participants may turn out to be lower than expected additionally the potentially addressable patient population for our investigational medicines may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our investigational medicines even if we obtain significant market share for our products if approved because the potential target populations are small we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications 

risks related to our business and operations 

we will need to develop and expand our company and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion which could disrupt our operations 

as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 1300 fulltime employees and in connection with the growth and advancement of our pipeline and operating as a public company we expect to increase the number of employees and the scope of our operations to manage our anticipated development and expansion including expansion outside of the united states we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel also our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its daytoday activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities 

as a growing biotechnology company we are actively pursuing development candidates and investigational medicines in many therapeutic areas and across a wide range of diseases successfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory and manufacturing pathways to all of these therapeutic areas and disease states requires a significant depth of talent resources and corporate processes in order to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas due to our limited resources and early stage of growth we may not be able to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel this may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure give rise to operational mistakes loss of business 

opportunities loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees the physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of our investigational medicines if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion our expenses may increase more than expected our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our covid19 vaccine or our other investigational medicines if approved and compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company 

our future success depends on our ability to retain key employees consultants and advisors and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we may not be able to retain employees or executives who have vested stock options 

our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial scientific and medical personnel we are highly dependent upon members of our management and scientific teams each of our executive officers and all of our employees including key scientists and clinicians are employed “at will” meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time the loss of any of these persons’ services may adversely impact the achievement of our research development financing and commercialization objectives we currently do not have “key person” insurance on any of our employees many of our key employees including members of our executive team have been with us for a long period of time and have valuable fully vested stock options or other longterm equity incentives we may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry particularly in cambridge massachusetts 

in addition we rely on consultants contractors and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development regulatory approval manufacturing and commercialization strategy our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us the loss of the services of one or more of our current employees or advisors might impede the achievement of our research development regulatory approval manufacturing and commercialization objectives in addition we have flexibly grown our workforce through the use of contractors and part time workers we may not be able to retain the services of such personnel which might result in delays in the operation of our business 

recruiting and retaining other qualified employees consultants and advisors for our business including scientific and technical personnel also will be critical to our success competition for skilled personnel including in mrna and lnp research clinical operations regulatory affairs therapeutic area management and manufacturing is intense and the turnover rate can be high we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on favorable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for individuals with similar skill sets in addition adverse publicity failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel furthermore we may not be successful commercializing our first product and as a result we may be unable to attract and retain highly qualified sales and marketing professionals to support our covid19 vaccine and our future products if approved the inability to recruit or loss of services of certain executives key employees consultants or advisors may impede the progress of our research development and global commercialization objectives and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our internal computer systems and physical premises or those of our strategic collaborators other contractors consultants or regulatory agencies with which we share sensitive data or information may fail or suffer security breaches which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and our manufacturing operations 

our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators vendors contractors consultants or regulatory authorities with whom we share sensitive data or information are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses unauthorized access natural disasters terrorism cybersecurity threats war and telecommunication and electrical failures we have experienced and may experience in the future cyberattacks on our information technology systems by threat actors of all types including but not limited to nation states organized crime other criminal enterprises individual actors andor advanced persistent threat groups in addition we may experience intrusions on our physical premises by any of these threat actors if any such cyberattack or physical intrusion were to cause interruptions in our operations such as a material disruption of our development programs or our manufacturing operations whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information it would have a material and adverse effect on us for example the loss of clinical trial data from one or more ongoing or completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data in addition because of our approach to running multiple clinical trials in parallel any breach of our computer systems or physical premises may result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across many of our programs in many stages of development any such breach loss or compromise of clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties or claims for damages either under the gdpr and relevant member state law in the eu other foreign laws and the federal health insurance 

portability and accountability act of 1996 hipaa and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the united states including the california consumer privacy act the ccpa on may 13 2020 the federal bureau of investigation fbi and cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency cisa announced that the fbi was investigating the targeting and compromise of us organizations conducting covid19related research by people’s republic of china or prcaffiliated cyber actors furthermore on july 16 2020 the national security agency and other us and foreign agencies released a joint cybersecurity advisory regarding the russian intelligence services’ targeting of covid19 research and vaccine development to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information including but not limited to information related to our rapid manufacture of mrna1273 we could incur liability our competitive and reputational position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our investigational medicines could be delayed the ccpa is of particular concern since it provides for a private right of actions for certain breaches of personal information 

we may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or investigational medicine and fail to capitalize on programs or investigational medicines that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success 

because we have limited resources we must choose to pursue and fund the development of selected research programs or investigational medicines and may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other programs or investigational medicines that could later prove to have greater commercial potential our resource allocation decisions or our contractual commitments to provide resources to our strategic collaborators under strategic alliance agreements may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities our spending on current and future research and development programs for investigational medicines may not yield any commercially viable products if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular investigational medicine we may relinquish valuable rights to that investigational medicine through a strategic alliance licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such investigational medicine or we may allocate internal resources to an investigational medicine in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a strategic alliance 

if we are not successful in discovering developing and commercializing additional products beyond our current portfolio our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired 

although a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine and the clinical trials and potential approval of our investigational medicines a key element of our strategy is to discover develop and potentially commercialize additional products beyond our current portfolio to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas we intend to do so by investing in our own drug discovery efforts exploring potential strategic alliances for the development of new products and inlicensing technologies identifying new investigational medicines requires substantial technical financial and human resources whether or not any investigational medicines are ultimately identified even if we identify investigational medicines that initially show promise we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize such products for many reasons including the following 

• the research methodology used may not be successful in identifying potential investigational medicines 

• competitors may develop alternatives that render our investigational medicines obsolete 

• investigational medicines we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights 

• an investigational medicine may on further study be shown to have harmful side effects or other characteristics that indicate it is unlikely to be effective or otherwise does not meet applicable regulatory criteria 

• an investigational medicine may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost or at all and 

• an approved product may not be accepted as safe and effective by patients the medical community or thirdparty payors 

if we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional products our potential for growth may be impaired 

product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product or investigational medicine that we may develop such as our covid19 vaccine 

we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the development testing manufacturing and marketing of our covid19 vaccine and our other current or future investigational medicines in clinical trials product liability claims and related crossclaims and claims for indemnification may be brought against us by patients healthcare providers or others using prescribing selling or otherwise coming into contact with our covid19 vaccine or other investigational medicines for example we may be sued if the covid19 vaccine or any other investigational medicine allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during clinical trials manufacturing or if approved marketing sale or commercial use if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our medicines caused injuries we could incur substantial liabilities 

• decreased demand for any investigational medicine that we may develop 

• loss of revenue 

• substantial monetary awards to patients healthy volunteers or their family members 

• payments to indemnify clinical trial sites and other clinical trial partners 

• significant time and costs to defend the related litigation 

• withdrawal of clinical trial participants 

• withdrawal of regulatory or marketing approval in a territory 

• the inability to commercialize any investigational medicines that we may develop and 

• injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention 

notwithstanding the risks undertaken by all persons who participate in clinical trials or who receive our covid19 vaccine and the information on risks provided to study investigators and patients participating in our clinical trials or receiving our covid19 vaccine it is possible that product liability claims will be asserted against us relating to the worsening of a patient’s condition injury or death alleged to have been caused by one of our products or investigational medicines or our covid19 vaccine any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing defects in design a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product including as a result of interactions with alcohol or other drugs knowledge of risks negligence strict liability and a breach of warranties claims could also be asserted under state consumer protection acts such claims might not be fully covered by product liability insurance if we succeed in marketing products including our covid19 vaccine product liability claims could result in an fda investigation of the safety and effectiveness of our products our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing programs and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action limitations on the approved indications for which they may be used suspension or withdrawal of approvals or license revocation regardless of the merits or eventual outcome liability claims may also result in decreased demand for our products injury to our reputation costs to defend the related litigation a diversion of management’s time and our resources substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients and a decline in our stock price 

we are also exposed to liabilities that are unique to developing and commercializing an mrna vaccine in the context of an ongoing global pandemic although the us government and certain foreign governments have contractually agreed to indemnify us or make statutory immunity available to us such indemnification or statutory immunity may not be available to cover potential claims or liabilities resulting from the research development manufacture distribution or commercialization of our covid19 vaccine substantial claims arising from the vaccine outside the scope of or in excess of us government or foreign government indemnity or statutory immunity could harm our financial condition and operating results moreover any adverse event or injury for which we are liable even if fully covered under an indemnity or immunity could negatively affect our reputation thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively 

we carry product liability insurance which we believe to be sufficient in light of our current commercial and clinical programs however we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability if and when we obtain marketing approval for investigational medicines we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products however we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts on occasion large judgments have been awarded in individual mass tort and class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and if judgments exceed our insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and business 

if the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future our operating results could be materially adversely affected likewise if insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers additionally even if we maintain insurance coverage for a type of liability a particular claim may not be covered if it is subject to a coverage exclusion or we do not otherwise meet the conditions for coverage if we operate our business without insurance or with inadequate insurance we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 

we may be subject directly or indirectly to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws false claims laws information privacy and security laws if we are unable to comply or have not fully complied with such laws we could face substantial penalties 

if we obtain fda approval for any of our investigational medicines and begin commercializing those products in the united states our operations will be directly or indirectly through our prescribers customers and purchasers subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations including without limitation the federal health care program antikickback statute the federal civil and criminal false claims act and physician payments sunshine act and regulations these laws will impact among other things our proposed sales marketing and educational programs in addition we may be subject to patient privacy laws enacted 

by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business the laws that will affect our operations include but are not limited to the following 

• the federal antikickback statute which prohibits among other things persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or paying any remuneration including any kickback bribe or rebate directly or indirectly overtly or covertly in cash or in kind to induce or reward or in return for either the referral of an individual for or the for the purchase order or recommendation or arranging of any good leasing or furnishing of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program such as the medicare and medicaid programs the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil false claims act or federal civil money penalties statute this statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers purchasers and formulary managers on the other although there are several statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution they are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor the aca amends the intent requirement of the federal antikickback statute to provide that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it 

• the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws including the federal false claims act prohibit among other things individuals or entities from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented claims for payment or approval from medicare medicaid or other government payors that are false or fraudulent in addition the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the antikickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal false claims act or federal civil money penalties statute manufacturers can be held liable under the false claims act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims companies that submit claims directly to payors may also be liable under the false claims act for the direct submission of such claims the false claims act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the false claims act and to share in any monetary recovery the aca provides and recent government cases against pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers support the view that federal antikickback statute violations and certain marketing practices including offlabel promotion may implicate the false claims act 

• the antiinducement law prohibits among other things the offering or giving of remuneration which includes without limitation any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value with limited exceptions to a medicare or medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program 

• hipaa and its implementing regulations which create new federal criminal statutes that prohibit a person from knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme or making false or fraudulent statements to defraud any healthcare benefit program regardless of the payor eg public or private or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses representations or promises any of the money or property owned by or under the custody or control of any healthcare benefit program regardless of the payor eg public or private and knowingly and willfully falsifying concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits items or services relating to healthcare matters similar to the federal antikickback statute a person or entity can be found guilty of violating hipaa without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it 

• hipaa as amended by the health information technology for economic and clinical health act of 2009 or hitech and their implementing regulations imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without appropriate authorization by entities subject to the rule such as health plans health care clearinghouses and health care providers as well as their respective “business associates” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create receive maintain transmit or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity hitech also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties amended hipaa to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal hipaa laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions 

• the us federal food drug and cosmetic act which prohibits among other things the adulteration or misbranding of drugs biologics and medical devices 

• federal transparency laws including the federal physician payment sunshine act which require disclosure of payments and other transfers of value provided by manufacturers of drugs devices biologicals and medical supplies to physicians currently defined to include doctors dentists optometrists podiatrists and chiropractors and teaching hospitals and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations effective january 1 2022 these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain nonphysician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners 

• state local and fo reign law and their regulatory equivalents of each of the above federal laws such as state antikickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services 

reimbursed by any thirdparty payor including private insurers and may be broader in scope than their federal equivalents state and foreign laws that require biopharmaceutical companies to comply with the biopharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and other relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers marketing expenditures or drug pricing and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances are also applicable to us and many of them differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect thus complicating compliance efforts in certain circumstances 

additionally on november 20 2020 hhs finalized a regulation that among other things removed safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers and created new safe harbor for certain fixed fees pursuant to an order entered by the us district court for the district of columbia the portion of the rule eliminating safe harbor protection for certain rebates related to the sale or purchase of a pharmaceutical product from a manufacturer to a plan sponsor under medicare part d has been delayed to january 1 2023 implementation of the this change and new safe harbors for pointofsale reductions in price for prescription pharmaceutical products and pharmacy benefit manager service fees are currently under review by the biden administration and may be amended or repealed it is not clear at this time what effect if any these and other changes to the antikickback safe harbors will have on our business 

the scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities can be time and resourceconsuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us we may be subject to significant sanctions including civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines disgorgement imprisonment reputational harm exclusion from participation in federal and state funded healthcare programs contractual damages and the curtailment or restricting of our operations as well as additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws further if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to similar penalties any action for violation of these laws even if successfully defended could cause a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to incur significant legal expenses and divert management’s attention from the operation of the business in addition the approval and commercialization of any product candidate we develop outside the united states will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above among other foreign laws all of these could harm our ability to operate our business and our financial results 

the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the european union and the uk the provision of benefits or advantages to induce or reward improper performance generally is also governed by the national antibribery laws of eu member states and the uk bribery act 2010 in the uk infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment eu directive 200183ec which is the eu directive governing medicinal products for human use provides that where medicinal products are being promoted to persons qualified to prescribe or supply them no gifts pecuniary advantages or benefits in kind may be supplied offered or promised to such persons unless they are inexpensive and relevant to the practice of medicine or pharmacy this provision has been transposed into the human medicines regulations 2012 and so remains applicable in the uk despite its departure from the eu 

payments made to physicians in certain european union member states must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization or the regulatory authorities of the individual european union member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

the collection and use of personally identifiable data including health data and medical data personal data in the european union is regulated by the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 the gdpr applies to personal data processed in connection with clinical trial activities in eu member states the gdpr imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the eu the gdpr grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal data allows them to exercise certain data subject requests including to request deletion of personal data in certain circumstances and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal recourse in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated further the gdpr imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the european union to the united states or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections failure to comply with the requirements of the gdpr may result in monetary penalties of up to €20 million or 4 of annual worldwide revenue whichever is higher in addition to risking such fines for any failure 

to comply with the gdpr we may require substantial costs in connection with our efforts to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with european data protection requirements 

further the uk’s decision to leave the eu often referred to as brexit has created uncertainty in data protection issues involving the uk for example pursuant to a postbrexit trade deal between the uk and the eu transfers of personal information from the european economic area to the uk are not considered restricted transfers under the gdpr for a period of up to six months from january 1 2021 however unless the european commission makes an adequacy finding with respect to the uk before the end of that period the uk will be considered a “third country” under the gdpr and transfers of european personal information to the uk will require an adequacy mechanism to render such transfers lawful under the gdpr additionally although the uk enacted a data protection act in may 2018 that is designed to be consistent with the gdpr uncertainty remains regarding how data transfers to and from the uk will be regulated notwithstanding brexit the full effects of brexit are uncertain and will remain so until the uk and eu reach a definitive resolution with regards to outstanding trade and legal matters given these possibilities and others we may not anticipate as well as the lack of comparable precedent the full extent to which our business results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by brexit is uncertain 

there is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with gdpr for example it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the eu or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring gdpr compliance may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters health epidemics or other business interruptions such as cybersecurity attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster 

natural disasters or health epidemics could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects if a natural disaster power outage cybersecurity attack health epidemic or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters damaged critical infrastructure such as our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers limited our ability to access or use our digital information systems or that otherwise disrupted operations it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time the disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event cybersecurity liability insurance is difficult to obtain and may not cover any damages we would sustain based on any breach of our computer security protocols or other cybersecurity attack we may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if our products become subject to a product recall it could harm our reputation business and financial results 

the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of certain commercialized products in the case of the fda the authority to require a recall of a biologic product must be based on an fda finding that a batch lot of other quantity of the biologic product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health in addition foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of any investigational medicine in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture manufacturers may under their own initiative recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found a governmentmandated or voluntary recall by us or our strategic collaborators could occur as a result of manufacturing errors design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues recalls of any of our investigational medicines would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales if any 

if we engage in future acquisitions joint ventures or strategic collaborations this may increase our capital requirements dilute our stockholders cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 

we may evaluate various acquisitions and collaborations including licensing or acquiring complementary products ip rights technologies or businesses any potential acquisition joint venture or collaboration may entail numerous risks including 

• increased operating expenses and cash requirements 

• the assumption of additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities 

• assimilation of operations ip and products of an acquired company including difficulties associated with integrating new personnel 

• the diversion of our management’s attention from our existing product programs and initiatives in pursuing such a strategic merger or acquisition 

• retention of key employees the loss of key personnel and uncertainties in our ability to maintain key business relationships 

• risks and uncertainties associated with the other party to such a transaction including the prospects of that party and their existing products or investigational medicines and regulatory approvals and 

• our inability to generate revenue from acquired technology or products sufficient to meet our objectives in undertaking the acquisition or even to offset the associated acquisition and maintenance costs 

in addition if we undertake acquisitions we may utilize our cash issue dilutive securities assume or incur debt obligations incur large onetime expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense 

moreover we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 

our stock price has been and in the future may be subject to substantial volatility from december 7 2018 our first day of trading on the nasdaq global select market through december 31 2020 our stock has traded within a range of a high price of 17850 and a low price of 1154 per share in addition since we began our development efforts with respect to our covid19 vaccine in early 2020 our stock has experienced pronounced and extended periods of volatility as a result of the volatility in our stock price our stockholders could incur substantial losses 

public statements by us government agencies the media competing vaccine developers financial analysts or others relating to the coronavirus outbreak including regarding our and others’ efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine have in the past resulted and may in the future result in significant fluctuations in our stock price given the global focus on the coronavirus pandemic information in the public arena on this topic whether or not accurate has had and will likely continue to have an outsized impact positive or negative on our stock price information related to our clinical trials manufacturing regulatory and commercialization efforts with respect to our covid19 vaccine or information regarding such efforts by competitors with respect to their vaccines and potential vaccines or the evolution of the pandemic may meaningfully impact our stock price 

the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies as a result of this volatility you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price the market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors including 

• the success of our covid19 vaccine sales 

• results of clinical trials of our investigational medicines or those of our competitors 

• the success of competitive products or technologies 

• commencement or termination of strategic alliances 

• regulatory or legal developments in the united states and other countries 

• developments or disputes concerning patent applications issued patents or other proprietary rights 

• the recruitment or departure of key personnel 

• product revenue 

• the level of expenses related to any of our products investigational medicines or clinical development programs 

• the results of our efforts to discover develop acquire or inlicense additional investigational medicines 

• actual or anticipated changes in estimates as to financial results development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts 

• variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us 

• changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems 

• market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors 

• general economic industry and market conditions 

• the numerous programs in our pipeline the development of which could each generate news or significant adverse events that could impact financial results or recommendations by securities analysts and 

• public announcements by us or our strategic collaborators regarding the progress of our development candidates or investigational medicines or similar public announcements by our competitors 

if our quarterly or annual results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially furthermore any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results may in turn cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

our stock price is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to significant price and volume fluctuations in response to market and other factors including the other factors discussed in our filings incorporated by reference herein or in future periodic reports variations in our quarterly operating results from our expectations or those of securities analysts or investors downward revisions in securities analysts’ estimates and announcement by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments 

in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities classaction litigation often has been instituted against that company such litigation if instituted against us could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management’s attention and resources which could seriously harm our business financial condition and results of operations and prospects 

we have broad discretion in the use of our cash cash equivalents and investments and may not use them effectively 

our management will have broad discretion in the application of our cash cash equivalents and investments and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock furthermore our operating expenses have significantly increased due to development and manufacturing activities for our covid19 vaccine program and we may not deploy our expanded capital base effectively the failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse impact on our business cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our investigational medicines pending their use we may invest our cash cash equivalents and investments in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value 

we are in the early stages of developing our policies and practices regarding preapproval access and any policy we develop and implement may result in a negative perception of our company and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as we advance our pipeline patients and their physicians have sought access to our investigational medicines outside of sponsored clinical trials and prior to regulatory approval while we will continue to review and respond to these early access requests at this stage in our development of a new class of medicines we are not providing access to our investigational medicines outside of the clinical trial setting as our development programs progress further we will continue our dialogue with patients and their families advocacy leaders physicians and others on this and other topics we will post our preapproval access policies in accordance with regulatory guidelines 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time subject to certain restrictions described below these sales or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our common stock 

the holders of up to 611 million shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for shares held by affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

additionally the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2018 stock option and incentive plan automatically increased on january 1 2020 and will automatically increase each january 1 thereafter by 4 of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding december 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by our compensation committee our compensation committee elected not to increase the number of shares reserved for issuance under our 2018 stock plan on january 1 2021 if our compensation committee elects to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year our stockholders may experience additional dilution 

in addition certain of our employees executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into rule 10b51 trading plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time under a rule 10b51 trading plan a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee director or officer when entering into the plan without further direction from the employee officer or director a rule 10b51 trading plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances our employees executive officers and directors also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a rule 10b51 trading plan when they are not in 

possession of material nonpublic information to the extent that sales or other distributions of moderna stock by our executive officers or directors are reported publicly whether or not conducted under a 10b51 plan such sales or distributions could lead to a decline in our stock price 

raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or development candidates or investigational medicines 

we may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings debt financings strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire or license ip rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise additional funds through collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties or through asset sales we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or development candidates or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us 

our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

our executive officers directors five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 211  of our outstanding common stock as of february 16 2021 therefore these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions for example these stockholders acting together may be able to exert significant influence over matters such as elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that 

• authorize “blank check” preferred stock which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting liquidation dividend and other rights superior to our common stock 

• create a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered threeyear terms 

• specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors the chairperson of our board of directors our chief executive officer or our president 

• prohibit stockholder action by written consent 

• establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors 

• provide that our directors may be removed only for cause 

• provide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office even though less than a quorum 

• specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors 

• expressly authorize our board of directors to modify alter or repeal our amended and restated bylaws and 

• require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws 

these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us 

any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future capital appreciation if any will be your sole source of gain 

we do not currently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business in addition the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future  

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware or the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us 

pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf 2 any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders 3 any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors officers employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our amended and restated bylaws or 4 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the delaware forum provision the delaware forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the securities act or the exchange act our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the united states district court for the district of massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act the federal forum provision we have chosen the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in cambridge massachusetts in addition our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the delaware forum provision and the federal forum provision provided however that stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder 

we recognize that the delaware forum provision and the federal forum provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the state of delaware or the commonwealth of massachusetts as applicable additionally the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees even though an action if successful might benefit our stockholders while the delaware supreme court ruled in march 2020 that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the securities act be brought in federal court are “facially valid” under delaware law there is uncertainty as to whether other courts will enforce our federal forum provision the federal forum provision may also impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert that the provision is unenforceable or invalid and if the federal forum provision is found to be unenforceable we may incur additional costs in resolving such matters the court of chancery of the state of delaware and the united states district court for the district of massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders 

general risk factors 

unfavorable us or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets including by the current covid19 pandemic or any other health epidemic the most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the most recent global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including weakened demand for our investigational medicines and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on favorable terms if at all a weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers possibly resulting in supply disruption or cause delays in payments for our services by thirdparty payors or our collaborators any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business 

our business and operations in the uk and eu may be negatively impacted by the united kingdom’s withdrawal from the eu 

on june 23 2016 the uk held a referendum in which a majority of voters approved an exit from the eu or brexit after nearly three years of negotiation and political and economic uncertainty the uk’s withdrawal from the eu became effective on january 31 2020 there was a transitional period during which eu laws including pharmaceutical laws continued to apply in the uk however this 

ended on december 31 2020 the uk and eu have signed a euuk trade and cooperation agreement which became provisionally applicable on january 1 2021 and will become formally applicable once ratified by both the uk and the eu this agreement provides details on how some aspects of the uk and eu’s relationship regarding medicinal products will operate particularly in relation to good manufacturing practice however there are still many uncertainties the longterm effects of brexit will depend in part on how the euuk trade and cooperation agreement and any future agreements signed by the uk and the eu take effect in practice such a withdrawal from the eu is unprecedented and it is unclear how the restrictions on the uk’s access to the european single market for goods capital services and labor within the eu and the wider commercial legal and regulatory environment could impact our current and future operations and clinical activities in the uk 

we expect that now the transition period has expired brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the uk determines which eu laws to replicate or replace including those related to the regulation of medicinal products any of these effects of brexit and others we cannot anticipate could negatively impact our business and results of operations in the uk 

the uncertainty concerning the uk’s legal political and economic relationship with the eu following brexit may also be a source of instability in the international markets create significant currency fluctuations andor otherwise adversely affect trading agreements or similar crossborder cooperation arrangements whether economic tax fiscal legal regulatory or otherwise 

our employees principal investigators and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading 

we are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees principal investigators and consultants misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations or the regulations applicable in the eu and other jurisdictions provide accurate information to the fda the ema and other regulatory authorities comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the united states and abroad or report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the fda or other regulatory authorities which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other business arrangements we have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 

employee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business 

our employees may from time to time bring lawsuits against us regarding injury creating a hostile work place discrimination wage and hour disputes sexual harassment or other employment issues in recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses certain companies that have faced employment or harassmentrelated lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business if we were to face any employmentrelated claims our business could be negatively affected 

if we fail to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials our operations also may produce hazardous waste products we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes we will not be able to eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential 

liabilities we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials 

in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these current or future laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 

changes in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in the jurisdictions in which it operates the rules dealing with us federal state and local and nonus income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by tax authorities changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock in recent years many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition or results of operations we urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

if the estimates we make or the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we cannot assure you however that our estimates or the assumptions underlying them will be correct 

the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges 

social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research development candidates investigational medicines and the diseases our development candidates and investigational medicines are being developed to treat social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear this evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business resulting in potential regulatory actions against us for example subjects may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical trial or to report an alleged adverse event when such disclosures occur there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our development candidates and investigational medicines there is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations we could incur liability face regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business 

we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives we are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared 

as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in addition the federal securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the sec and nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies including requirements to file annual quarterly and event driven reports with respect to our business and financial condition and to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly for example these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may not be able to produce reliable financial statements or file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the sec or comply with the nasdaq listing requirements in addition we could make errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm however while we were an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act our auditors were not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year ended december 31 2019 we qualified as a “large accelerated filer” as defined in the 

securities exchange act of 1934 as amended or the exchange act and as a result ceased to qualify as an emerging growth company accordingly commencing with our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 we were required to have our auditors formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 our compliance with section 404 necessitates that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts we will continue to dedicate internal resources potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by section 404 this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements

overview 

we are a biotechnology company pioneering messenger rna mrna therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines to improve the lives of patients mrna medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular membrane or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mrna science delivery technology and manufacturing providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates we are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases independently and with our strategic collaborators 

within our platform we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features we call that group a “ modality” while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases they share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals and pharmaceutical properties programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk we have created six modalities to date 

• prophylactic vaccines 

• systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics 

• cancer vaccines 

• intratumoral immunooncology 

• localized regenerative therapeutics and 

• systemic intracellular therapeutics 

we have designated our prophylactic vaccines and systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modalities as our “core modalities” in these core modalities our strategy is to invest in additional development candidates using our accumulated innovations in technology our process insights and our preclinical and clinical experience our exploratory modalities continue to be a critical part of advancing our strategy to maximize the application of our potential mrna medicines 

2020 business highlights 

we brought five new development candidates forward in 2020 a covid19 vaccine mrna1273 interleukin2 il2 programmed deathligand 1 pdl1 a pediatric respiratory syncytial virus rsv vaccine and an epsteinbarr virus ebv vaccine as part of our mission to use our technology to advance global public health 

in response to the global coronavirus pandemic we are pursuing the rapid development and manufacture of our mrna1273 vaccine for the treatment of sarscov2 the novel strain of coronavirus that causes covid19 in collaboration with the vaccine research center and division of microbiology and infectious diseases of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases or niaid part of the national institutes of health or nih the progress of mrna1273 during 2020 has resulted in the need for us to devote significant resources toward the development and manufacture of this product significant capital investment is necessary for ongoing clinical development manufacturing and distribution of the covid19 vaccine at a scale necessary to meet demand in a global pandemic environment this capital investment includes the ongoing clinical development for updated versions of the covid19 vaccine that may provide continued protection against variants of the sarscov2 virus barda has committed to fund up to 9549 million to accelerate the clinical development and manufacturing process scaleup of our covid19 vaccine under the terms of the agreement barda will fund the advancement of mrna1273 to fda licensure and the scaleup of manufacturing processes the agreement does not contemplate any product stockpiling 

in february and may 2020 we completed two separate public equity offerings resulting in aggregate net proceeds of 185 billion net of underwriting discounts commissions and offering expenses this additional funding has enabled us to substantially expand our manufacturing network purchase the required capital equipment hire appropriate global staff and secure the raw materials and other consumables to manufacture substantial doses of our covid19 vaccine 

in december 2020 we received an emergency use authorization eua from the us food and drug administration fda and an interim order from health canada authorizing our covid19 vaccine for use in the us and canada since january 1 2021 we have received additional provisional interim or conditional approvals for the use and distribution of our covid19 vaccine from regulatory authorities in the european union the united kingdom switzerland qatar israel and singapore  

in august 2020 we entered into a supply agreement with the us government the us supply agreement for the supply of 100 million doses of our covid19 vaccine the agreement was subsequently amended in december 2020 in connection with the us governments exercise of an option for an additional 100 million doses bringing the total to 200 million doses of our covid19 vaccine for a total consideration of up to 319 billion the total consideration includes approximately 3000 million of incentive payments which we earned as a result of securing an emergency use authorization eua before january 31 2021 as a result of our satisfying the requirements for this incentive payment the total price for the supply of the first 100 million doses inclusive of the 3000 million incentive is 153 billion we will receive such incentive payments as product is delivered to and accepted by the us government pursuant to the us supply agreement the us government made a 6014 million upfront payment to us which represents approximately 50 of the fixed price per dose that we are entitled to receive for the committed first 100 million doses we will receive the remainder of the fixed price per dose upon delivery and acceptance of contracted doses to the us government we are required to secure manage and maintain storage for any contracted doses of mrna1273 based on the specific requirements of the contract and deliver the product to designated government facilities we will be reimbursed for such services at a negotiated price subsequent to december 31 2020 the us government exercised a second option to purchase 100 million doses on february 11 2021 bringing its total order to 300 million doses with a remaining option for 200 million doses the price for each option is fixed at a price of 165 billion per 100 million doses the us supply agreement contains terms and conditions that are customary for us government agreements of this nature including provisions giving the us government the right to terminate the agreement if the applicable contracting officer determines that a termination is in the us government’s interest following any such termination we and the us government may agree upon the amount to be paid or remaining to be paid to us because of the termination 

in addition we have entered into supply agreements with several other governmental agencies outside the united states for the supply of our covid19 vaccine the agreements are generally subject to receipt of authorization or approval for the use and distribution of the vaccine from the relevant regulatory authority in each jurisdiction under these agreements we are entitled to upfront deposits for our covid19 vaccine supply initially recorded as deferred revenue as of december 31 2020 we had approximately 380 billion in deferred revenue in connection with the supply agreements with the us government and other governmental agencies which will be recognized as revenue when revenue recognition criteria have been met between the granting of the eua by the fda on december 18 2020 and the end of 2020 we delivered 128 million doses of our covid19 vaccine and recognized product sales of 1999 million in addition we delivered 40 million doses of our covid19 vaccine to the us government under the barda agreement through december 31 2020 for a total of nearly 17 million doses delivered to the us government and canada between receipt of our eua authorization and the end of the year and satisfying the criteria for revenue recognition 

for more information on our strategic priorities for 2021 please see “business—the mrna opportunity—our strategic priorities” above 

the early investment we made in our manufacturing and digital capabilities prepared us to rapidly scale our production to accommodate between 700 million doses and 1 billion doses of our covid19 vaccine in 2021 we are continuing to invest and add staff to build up to potentially 1 billion doses for 2021 

we have a diverse development pipeline and the broad potential applications of mrna medicines have led us to raise significant capital and adopt a longterm approach to capital allocation that balances nearterm risks and longterm value creation as of december 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and investments of approximately 525 billion of which 821 million was related to product sales and 284 billion was related to customer deposits for the future supply of our covid19 vaccine we use this capital to fund operations and investing activities for technology creation drug discovery and clinical development programs infrastructure and capabilities to enable our research engine and early development engine which includes our moderna technology center our digital infrastructure creation of our portfolio of intellectual property acquisition of key raw materials and supplies to support our commercial production quantities development of a commercial team expansion into global markets and administrative support 

since our inception we have incurred significant operating losses our net losses were 7471 million 5140 million and 3847 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively as of december 31 2020 our accumulated deficit was 224 billion 

for the foreseeable future  we may continue to incur significant expenses in connection with our ongoing activities including as we 

• continue our platform research and drug discovery and development efforts 

• conduct clinical trials for our investigational medicines 

• manufacture our covid19 vaccine 

• manufacture clinical trial materials and develop largescale manufacturing capabilities 

• seek regulatory approval for our investigational medicines 

• maintain expand and protect our intellectual property 

• hire additional personnel to support our program development effort to obtain regulatory approval and secure additional facilities for operations 

• build up our commercial operations and organization and 

• continue to operate as a public company 

if we seek to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize further of our investigational medicines we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses which include establishing a sales marketing manufacturing and distribution infrastructure globally as a result we may need substantial additional funding to support our continued operations and pursue our growth strategy in addition to our product sales if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis we may be required to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings structured financings and debt financings government funding arrangements strategic alliances and marketing manufacturing distribution and licensing arrangements we may not be able to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements on favorable terms or at all if we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our programs because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical development we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations 

the covid19 pandemic impacted certain of our business operations for instance we are experiencing disruptions in the conduct of certain of our clinical trials including our ability to initiate and complete our clinical trials within the originally anticipated timelines site initiation participant recruitment and enrollment participant dosing distribution of clinical trial materials study monitoring and data analysis may or continue to be paused or delayed while to date we have not experienced significant disruptions in our supply chain and distribution an extended duration of this pandemic could result in such disruptions in the future 

financial operations overview 

revenue 

the following table summarizes revenue for each period presented in thousands 



we began to record product sales for our covid19 vaccine subsequent to its authorization for emergency use by the fda and health canada in december 2020 for the year ended december 31 2020 we recognized 1999 million of product sales from sales of our covid19 vaccine 

other than product sales our revenue has been primarily derived from governmentsponsored and private organizations including barda darpa and the gates foundation and from strategic alliances with astrazeneca merck and vertex to discover develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines 

the following table summarizes collaboration revenue for the periods presented in thousands 



grant revenue from barda increased significantly in 2020 as a result of an award to accelerate development of our covid19 vaccine 

the following table summarizes collaboration revenue for the periods presented in thousands 



we expect our product sales to significantly increase in 2021 as of december 31 2020 we had signed supply agreements of approximately 1165 billion for the future supply of our covid19 vaccine and had deferred revenue of 380 billion associated with customer deposits received or billable under these agreements additional supply agreements have been agreed upon since december 31 2020 and others are under discussion for 2021 and 2022 deliveries in addition we expect to continue to receive funding from our contract with barda as of december 31 2020 the remaining available funding net of revenue earned was 4443 million to the extent that existing or potential future products generate revenue our revenue may vary due to many uncertainties in the independent development of our mrna medicines and pursuant to our strategic alliances and other factors 

we expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we continue our research and development and commercialization efforts we expect our programs to mature and advance to later stage clinical development and we expect expenses to increase as we seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines and commercialize any approved mrna medicines if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis we may incur losses in the future

cost of sales includes raw materials personnel and facility and other costs associated with manufacturing our commercial product these costs include production materials production costs at our manufacturing facilities thirdparty manufacturing costs and final formulation and packaging costs cost of sales also includes shipping costs and royalties payable to third parties based on sales of our products 

research and development expenses 

the nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs 

research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following 

• cost to develop our platform 

• discovery efforts leading to development candidates 

• preclinical nonclinical and clinical development costs for our programs 

• costs related to prelaunch inventory 

• cost to develop our manufacturing technology and infrastructure and 

• digital infrastructure costs 

the costs above comprise the following categories 

• personnelrelated expenses including salaries benefits and stockbased compensation expense 

• expenses incurred under agreements with third parties such as consultants investigative sites contract research organizations or cros that conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and inlicensing arrangements 

• expenses associated with developing manufacturing capabilities and acquiring materials for preclinical studies clinical trials and prelaunch inventory including both internal manufacturing and thirdparty contract manufacturing organizations or cmos 

• expenses incurred for the procurement of materials laboratory supplies and noncapital equipment used in the research and development process and 

• facilities depreciation and amortization and other direct and allocated expenses incurred as a result of research and development activities 

we use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform and for discovering and developing programs due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are generally not recorded or maintained on a program or modalityspecific basis 

the following table reflects our research and development expenses including direct program specific expenses summarized by modality and indirect or shared operating costs summarized under other research and development expenses during the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 in thousands 



 

1 includes a total of 21 development candidates at each of december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 programspecific expenses include external costs and allocated manufacturing costs of prelaunch inventory mrna supply and consumables and are reflected as of the beginning of the period in which the program was internally advanced to development or removed if development was ceased 

2 relates to an inlicensing agreement entered into in june 2017 with cellscript llc to sublicense certain patent rights 

a “modality” refers to a group of programs with common product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes the programspecific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs which consist primarily of external costs such as fees paid to outside consultants central laboratories investigative sites and cros in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials cmos and allocated manufacturing costs of prelaunch inventory mrna supply and consumables costs to acquire and manufacture prelaunch inventory mrna supply for preclinical studies and clinical trials are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred and subsequently allocated to programspecific manufacturing costs after completion of the programspecific production the timing of allocating manufacturing costs to the specific program varies depending on the program 

development and production schedule we generally do not allocate personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation costs associated with our general platform research technical development and other shared costs on a programspecific basis these costs were therefore excluded from the summary of programspecific expenses by modality 

discovery program expenses are costs associated with research activities for our programs in the preclinical discovery stage and primarily consist of external costs for cros and lab services and allocated manufacturing cost of preclinical mrna supply and consumables 

platform research expenses are mainly costs to develop technical advances in mrna science delivery science and manufacturing process design these costs include personnelrelated costs computer equipment facilities preclinical mrna supply and consumables and other administrative costs to support our platform research technology development and unallocated manufacturing expenses are primarily related to nonprogramspecific manufacturing process development and manufacturing costs 

shared discovery and development expenses are research and development costs such as personnelrelated costs and other costs which are not otherwise included in development programs discovery programs platform research technical development and unallocated manufacturing expenses stockbased compensation and other expenses 

the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities including development of our platform mrna technologies and manufacturing technologies we expense research and development costs as incurred and cannot reasonably estimate the nature timing and estimated costs required to complete the development of the development candidates and investigational medicines we are currently developing or may develop in the future there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development of such development candidates and investigational medicines including but not limited to 

• scope progress and expense of developing ongoing and future development candidates and investigational medicines 

• entry in and completion of related preclinical studies 

• enrollment in and completion of subsequent clinical trials 

• safety and efficacy of investigational medicines resulting from these clinical trials 

• changes in laws or regulations relevant to the investigational medicines in development 

• receipt of the required regulatory approvals and 

• commercialization including establishing manufacturing and marketing capabilities 

as we continue to progress mrna1273 through the development process toward a biologics license application approval and indication expansion of mrna1273 during the current pandemic we expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses at this time the magnitude of these potential expenditures is not known in connection with the barda agreement to accelerate development of mrna1273 significant grant revenue and expenses are expected in 2021 bardas funding is expected to offset those expenses that are covered under the barda agreement subject to our obtaining reimbursement from barda 

changes in expectations or outcomes of any of the known or unknown risks and uncertainties may materially impact our expected research and development expenditures continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development such as our cmv vaccine mrna1647 and our covid19 vaccine generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials we expect our research and development costs to continue to increase in the foreseeable future as our investigational medicines progress through the development phases and identify and develop additional programs there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our investigational medicines including future trial design and various regulatory requirements many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time due to the early stage of development of our investigational medicines moreover future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans 

selling general and administrative expenses 

we started to incur sales and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020 to prepare for commercial operations in connection with the sale of our covid19 vaccine selling general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation for executives finance legal human resources business development and other administrative and operational functions professional fees accounting and legal services information technology and facilityrelated costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property or ip these costs relate to the operation of the business unrelated to the research and development function or any individual program selling general and administrative expenses including iprelated expenses totaled 1883 million 1096 million and 943 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively iprelated expenses including our internal personnelrelated costs were 135 million 134 million and 119 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

we anticipate selling general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to expand the number of programs in development and prepare for the establishment of commercial activities both within and outside the united states we have already incurred additional expenses related to building out a regulatory sales and marketing team to support the sale marketing and distribution of our covid19 vaccine if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our investigational medicines and do not enter into one or more thirdparty commercialization collaboration and manufacturing arrangements we will incur significant additional expenses related to building out these functions 

we have a broad ip portfolio covering our development and commercialization of mrna vaccine and therapeutic programs including those related to mrna design formulation and manufacturing platform technologies we regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development we also hold trademarks and trademark applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions costs to secure and defend our ip are expensed as incurred and are classified as selling general and administrative expenses 

interest income 

interest income consists of interest generated from our investments in cash and cash equivalents money market funds and highquality fixed income securities 

other expense net 

other expense net consists of interest expense gains losses from the sale of investments in marketable securities and other income and expense unrelated to our core operations interest expense is primarily derived from our finance leases related to our moderna technology center manufacturing facility or mtc south and moderna technology center north or mtc north 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions on an ongoing basis we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances facts and experience the effects of material revisions in estimates if any are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates 

while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our 

consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates 

revenue recognition 

product sales 

product sales are associated with our covid19 vaccine supply agreements with the us government and international government agencies these agreements generally do not provide provisions for various forms of variable consideration such as discounts rebates or returns we recognize revenue from product sales using the fivestep model under asc 606 based on the fixed price per dose according to the contracts when control of the product transfers to the customer and customer acceptance has occurred unless such acceptance provisions are deemed perfunctory 

collaboration revenue 

our alliances with strategic collaborators typically contain multiple elements including research and other licenses options to obtain development and commercialization rights research and development services obligations to develop and manufacture preclinical and clinical material and options to obtain additional research and development services and preclinical and clinical material such arrangements provide for various types of payments to us including upfront fees funding of research and development services and preclinical and clinical material technical development regulatory and commercial milestone payments licensing fees option exercise fees and royalty and earnout payments on product sales such payments are often not commensurate with the timing of revenue recognition and therefore result in deferral of revenue recognition 

we analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of accounting standards codification asc topic 808 collaborative arrangements asc 808 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities if we conclude that some or all aspects of the arrangement are within the scope of asc 808 and do not represent a transaction with a customer we recognize our allocation of the shared costs incurred with respect to the jointly conducted activities as a component of the related expense in the period incurred if we conclude that some or all aspects of the arrangement represent a transaction with a customer we account for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of asc 606 revenue from contracts with customers  

to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of asc 606 we perform the following steps i identify the contracts with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied asc 606 requires significant judgment and estimates and results in changes to but not limited to i the determination of the transaction price including estimates of variable consideration ii the allocation of the transaction price including the determination of estimated selling price and iii the pattern of recognition including the application of proportional performance as a measure of progress on servicerelated promises and application of pointintime recognition for supplyrelated promises 

the transaction price is generally comprised of an upfront payment due at contract inception and variable consideration in the form of payments for our services and materials and milestone payments due upon the achievement of specified events other payments the company could be entitled to include tiered royalties earned when customers recognize net sales of licensed products we consider the existence of any significant financing component within our arrangements and have determined that a significant financing component does not exist in our arrangements as substantive business purposes exist to support the payment structure other than to provide a significant benefit of financing we measure the transaction price based on the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods andor services to the customer we utilize either the expected value method or the most likely amount method to estimate the amount of variable consideration depending on which method is expected to better predict the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved with respect to arrangements that include payments for a development or regulatory milestone payment we evaluate whether the associated event is considered probable of achievement and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee such as those dependent upon receipt of regulatory approval are not considered to be probable of achievement until the triggering event occurs at the end of each reporting period we reevaluate the probability of achievement of each milestone and any related constraint and if necessary adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catchup basis which would affect revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment for arrangements that include salesbased royalties including milestone payments based upon the achievement of a certain level of product sales wherein the license is deemed to be the sole or predominant item to which the payments relate we recognize revenue upon the later of i when the related sales occur or ii when the performance obligation to which some or all of the payment has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied consideration that would be received for optional goods andor services is excluded from the transaction price at contract inception 

we generally allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation in consideration of applicable market conditions and relevant entityspecific factors including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated research and development costs however in certain instances we allocate variable consideration entirely to one or more performance obligation if the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the respective performance obligation and the amount allocated is consistent with the amount we would expect to receive for the satisfaction of the respective performance obligation 

we recognize revenue based on the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to the customer for performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time we recognize revenue when control of the goods andor services is transferred to the customer for performance obligations that are satisfied over time we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using a single method of measuring progress which depicts the performance in transferring control of the associated goods andor services to the customer we generally use input methods to measure the progress toward the complete satisfaction of performance obligations satisfied over time with respect to arrangements containing a license to our intellectual property that is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement we recognize revenue from amounts allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license for licenses that are bundled with other promises we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and if over time the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement we evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and if necessary adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catchup basis which would affect revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment 

prelaunch inventory 

prior to an initial regulatory approval for our investigational medicines we expense costs relating to raw materials and production of inventory as research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the period incurred when we believe regulatory approval and subsequent commercialization of our investigational medicines is probable and we also expect future economic benefit from the sales of the investigational medicines to be realized we will then capitalize the costs of production as inventory 

upon the authorization of distribution and use of our covid19 vaccine under an eua in december 2020 we began to capitalize inventory costs associated with our covid19 vaccine as it was determined that inventory costs incurred subsequent to the eua had a probable future economic benefit 

research and development costs 

as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses a significant portion of which are clinical study expenses conducted by thirdparty service providers this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to 

• cros to conduct our clinical trials 

• investigative sites in connection with clinical trials 

• vendors for laboratory services supplies and distribution of materials in connection with clinical trials and 

• vendors in connection with preclinical development activities 

we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones in accruing service fees we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly 

we make estimates of our research and development accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time we recognize costs for certain development activities based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites such as number of sites activated number of patient enrollments and visits and patient duration we determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials we periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary upon settlement these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual costs however due to the nature of estimates we 

cannot provide assurance that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our research activities and clinical trials 

stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units we measure and recognize compensation expense for our stockbased awards granted to our employees and nonemployee directors based on the estimated grant date fair value in accordance with asc 718 compensation—stock compensation  

our stockbased awards are subject to either service or performancebased vesting conditions we recognize compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployee directors with servicebased vesting on a straightline basis based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployee directors with performancebased vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using an accelerated attribution method to the extent the achievement of the performance condition is probable we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur we classify stockbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified 

we determine the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the fair value of our common stock we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model which requires inputs of subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of our stock ii the expected term of the award iii the riskfree interest rate iv expected dividends and v the fair value of common stock due to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data we based our estimate of expected volatility on the estimate and expected volatilities of a guideline group of publicly traded companies for these analyses we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value risk profiles and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stockbased awards we compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stockbased awards we will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available we estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees and nonemployee directors using the simplified method whereby the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option we utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for stock options granted to nonemployees we utilize the contractual term of the option as the basis for the expected term assumption for the determination of the riskfree interest rates we utilize the us treasury yield curve for instruments in effect at the time of measurement with a term commensurate with the expected term assumption the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes based on an asset and liability approach we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income the amount and timing of which are uncertain valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31 2020 we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence including our history of incurring significant losses from operations we will continue to monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets as we may generate profits in 2021 if we are able to fulfill our obligations under the supply agreements for our covid19 vaccine we may release all or a portion of the valuation allowance in the nearterm however the release of the valuation allowance as well as the exact timing and the amount of such release continue to be subject to among other things our level of profitability revenue growth clinical program progression and expectations regarding future profitability we may become subject to income tax audits and adjustments by local tax authorities the nature of uncertain tax positions is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change which may be substantial we develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions and the associated cumulative probabilities using internal expertise and assistance from thirdparty experts as additional information becomes available estimates are revised and refined differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax expense we record reserves for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions these reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

we have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations 

results of operations 

the following tables summarize our consolidated statements of operations for each period presented in thousands 





revenue 

total revenue increased by 7432 million or 1234 in 2020 due to increases in grant revenue product sales and collaboration revenue grant revenue increased by 5167 million or 4245 in 2020 mainly due to an increase in revenue from barda related to our covid19 vaccine development in 2020 product revenue was 1999 million in 2020 from sales of our covid19 vaccine 

subsequent to the authorization by the fda and health canada for emergency use in december 2020 collaboration revenue increased by 266 million or 55 in 2020 primarily due to increased revenue from astrazeneca and vertex attributable to a change in estimated costs for our future performance obligations under the collaboration agreement with astrazeneca and an increase in reimbursable costs under the collaboration agreement with vertex partially offset by a decrease in revenue from merck 

total revenue decreased by 749 million or 55 in 2019 primarily due to decrease in collaboration revenue collaboration revenue decreased by 745 million or 61 in 2019 mainly due to decreased revenue across all our strategic alliances particularly astrazeneca and merck largely driven by our adoption of asc 606 and the completion of the initial fouryear research period under the 2016 merck agreement grant revenue remained relatively flat in 2019 there was a decrease in revenue from darpa as the research and development activities under the darpa awards were substantially concluded at the end of 2018 offset by increases in revenue from the gates foundation and barda 

operating expenses 

cost of sales 

we began capitalizing our covid19 vaccine inventory costs in december 2020 in connection with an emergency use authorization from the fda and an interim order from health canada for use of our covid19 vaccine and based upon our expectation that these costs would be recoverable through commercialization of mrna1273 prior to the capitalization of our covid19 vaccine inventory costs such costs were recorded as research and development expenses in the period incurred we expensed 2420 million of prelaunch inventory costs in 2020 our cost of sales were 79 million or 40 of our product sales in 2020 comprised of thirdparty royalties of 69 million and shipping and handling costs of 10 million as the associated inventory costs were expensed previously if inventory sold during 2020 was valued at cost our cost of sales for 2020 would have been 624 million or 312 of our product sales at december 31 2020 we had 1875 million of zerocost covid19 vaccine inventory that we expect to sell prior to march 31 2021 we expect our cost of sales as a percentage of our product sales will increase reflecting the full cost of manufacturing subsequent to the utilization of our zerocost mrna1273 inventory 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses increased by 8740 million or 176 in 2020 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in clinical trial expenses of 3212 million an increase in manufacturing expenses of 3017 million an increase in personnel related costs of 1052 million an increase in technology and facility related expenses of 742 million and an increase in consulting and outside services of 607 million the increase in 2020 was largely attributable to mrna1273 clinical development and prelaunch inventory buildup prior to the authorization from the fda the increase in personnel related costs was primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees supporting our mrna1273 development activities as well as other research and development programs 

research and development expenses increased by 422 million or 9 in 2019 the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs of 374 million an increase in clinical trial and manufacturing costs of 169 million and an increase in stockbased compensation of 106 million the increases were partially offset by a decrease in inlicensing costs of 220 million related to inlicensing agreements executed in 2017 with cellscript llc and its affiliate mrna ribotherapeutics inc cellscript to sublicense certain patent rights and a decrease in lab supplies and materials of 82 million the increases in personnel related costs and stockbased compensation were largely driven by an increase in the number of employees supporting our research and development programs the inlicensing costs decreased in 2019 as the sublicense grant fees were fully recognized at the end of 2018 

we expect that research and development expenses will increase as we continue to progress mrna1273 through the development process toward a bla approval and indication expansion during the current pandemic and continue to develop our pipeline and advance our product candidates into laterstage development in addition we also expect to incur significant costs related to the development of new generations of our covid19 vaccine designed to address new variants of the virus 

selling general and administrative expenses 

selling general and administrative expenses increased by 786 million or 72 in 2020 the increase was mainly due to an increase in personnel related costs of 309 million an increase in consulting and outside services of 269 million and an increase in legal and other licensing expenses of 142 million the increases in personnel costs and consulting and outside services were primarily attributable to increased headcount and mrna1273 vaccine candidate commercializationrelated activities 

general and administrative expenses increased by 154 million or 16 in 2019 the increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance costs of 52 million an increase in consulting and outside services of 49 million an increase in information technology and facilityrelated costs of 40 million and an increase in personnel related costs of 25 million the increases in insurance costs 

consulting and outside services and personnel related costs were primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees and costs in support of being a publicly traded company 

we expect that selling general and administrative expenses will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as we continue to expand the number of programs and our business operations and continue to build out our global commercial regulatory sales and marketing infrastructure to support the commercialization of our covid19 vaccine 

interest income 

interest income generated from our investments in marketable securities decreased by 138 million or 36 in 2020 mainly attributable to an overall lower interest rate 

interest income generated from our investments in marketable securities increased by 115 million or 43 in 2019 mainly driven by a higher weighted average balance of cash and investments primarily from the net proceeds of our ipo 

other expense income net 

the following tables summarizes other expense income net for each period presented in thousands 





total other expense net decreased by 14 million or 19 in 2020 the decrease was primarily due to an increase in foreign currency gains and a reclassification of other income in 2020 offset by a higher interest expense driven by a new finance lease commenced in 2020 for a laboratory and office space moderna technology center north mtc north please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

total other expense net increased by 94 million in 2019 the increase was mainly attributable to a onetime 70 million cash receipt in 2018 as consideration for the waiver of a third partys previously negotiated commitment and higher interest expense in 2019 of 35 million related to our financing lease liabilities we started recording the interest expense in july 2018 upon the completion of our moderna technology center manufacturing facility or mtc south please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

provision for benefit from income taxes 

there was a tax provision of 25 million in 2020 primarily related to foreign income taxes there were no significant income tax benefits or provisions in 2019 and 2018 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity instruments and from proceeds from certain strategic alliance arrangements and grant agreements during 2020 we entered into supply agreements with the us government and several governmental agencies outside the united states for the supply of mrna1273 our covid19 vaccine and received upfront deposits of 292 billion of which 821 million was recognized as product sales in addition we raised 185 billion in total through two public equity offerings in 2020 as of december 31 2020 we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 525 billion cash cash equivalents and investments are invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation investments consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities are stated at fair value as of december 31 2020 we had current and noncurrent investments of approximately 198 billion and 064 billion respectively 

we began construction of our mtc south facility in the second half of 2016 and completed construction in 2019 in the second quarter of 2019 we entered into an additional lease for office and laboratory space nearby for our mtc north facility and construction on this facility began in 2019 and is continuing our capital expenditures related to our mtc facilities were 466 million 39 million and 865 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively cash disbursements related to our mtc facilities were 417 million 146 million and 945 million for the years ended december 31 2020 2019 and 2018 respectively 

on january 30 2018 and february 15 2018 we issued series g preferred stock for total gross proceeds of 5600 million on may 7 2018 we issued series h preferred stock for gross proceeds of 1250 million of which 130 million was determined to be a premium and recorded to deferred revenue as part of the merck pcvsav agreement executed contemporaneously with our series h redeemable convertible preferred stock issuance 

on december 11 2018 we closed our ipo whereby we sold 26275993 shares of common stock at a price of 2300 per share the shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market on december 7 2018 the aggregate net proceeds received by us from the ipo were 5630 million net of underwriting discounts commissions and offering expenses 

in february 2020 we completed a public equity offering of 30263158 shares of common stock including exercise of the underwriters option overallotment option at a price of 1900 per share the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were 5495 million net of underwriting discounts commissions and offering expenses 

in may 2020 we completed a public equity offering of 17600000 shares of common stock at a price of 7600 per share the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were 130 billion net of underwriting discounts commission and offering expenses 

we have used and intend to use the net proceeds from these equity offerings i to fund working capital needs raw materials labor and capital equipment purchases related to the manufacturing of mrna1273 for distribution in the united states and outside the united states assuming necessary regulatory approvals are obtained and the remainder if any ii to fund clinical development and drug discovery in existing and new therapeutic areas iii to fund further development of our mrna technology platform and the creation of new modalities or iv to fund working capital and other general corporate purposes 

cash flow 

the following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for each period presented in thousands 



operating activities 

we derive cash flows from operations primarily from cash collected from customer deposits related to our covid19 vaccine supply agreements as well as certain governmentsponsored and private organizations and strategic alliances our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business prior to 2020 we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we have invested in our mrna technologies development pipeline digital infrastructure manufacturing technology and infrastructure 

net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was 203 billion and consisted of net loss of 7471 million less noncash adjustments of 1970 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 258 billion noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 930 million leased assets expensed of 623 million depreciation and amortization of 313 million and amortization of investment premiums and discounts of 102 million the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of 384 billion an increase in accrued liabilities of 3884 million an increase in accounts payable of 119 million and an increase in operating lease liabilities of 118 million partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 139 billion an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 2410 million an increase of inventory of 465 million and an increase in operating lease rightofuse assets of 105 million 

net cash used in operating activities in 2019 was 4590 million and consisted of net loss of 5140 million less noncash adjustments of 1087 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 537 million noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 811 million depreciation and amortization of 310 million and amortization of investment premiums and discounts of 37 million the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of 441 million a decrease in accounts payable of 240 million a decrease in other liabilities of 62 million an increase in rightofuse assets operating leases of 57 million and an decrease in accrued liabilities of 34 million partially offset by an increase in operating lease liabilities noncurrent of 126 million a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 98 million and a decrease in accounts receivable of 67 million 

net cash used in operating activities in 2018 was 3309 million and consisted of net loss of 3847 million less noncash adjustments of 965 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 426 million noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 726 million and depreciation and amortization of 249 million the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of 653 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 53 million partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of 150 million and an increase in accrued liabilities of 88 million 

investing activities 

our primary investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of our investments and capital expenditures for manufacturing laboratory computer equipment and software 

net cash used in investing activities in 2020 was 167 billion which included purchases of marketable securities of 296 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 674 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 114 billion and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 2147 million 

net cash used in investing activities in 2019 was 149 million which included purchases of marketable securities of 115 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 316 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 9932 million and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 1687 million 

net cash used in investing activities in 2018 was 3731 million which included purchases of marketable securities of 123 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 1058 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 7834 million and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 1770 million 

financing activities 

we generated cash from financing activities of 203 billion in 2020 primarily from net proceeds from equity offerings of 185 billion net proceeds from the issuance of common stock through our equity plans of 1796 million and proceeds from the purchase of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan of 70 million 

we generated cash from financing activities of 511 million in 2019 primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity plans of 473 million and net proceeds from the purchase of common stock from our employee stock purchase plan of 29 million 

we generated cash from financing activities of 123 billion in 2018 primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock of 6611 million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 5630 million in connection with our ipo 

operation and funding requirements 

since our inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations due to our significant research and development expenses we have an accumulated deficit of 224 billion and 150 billion as of december 31 2020 and 2019 respectively we expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities particularly as we continue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines we also expect our expenses to increase associated with manufacturing costs including our arrangements with our international supply and manufacturing partners our ongoing work on mrna1273 will require significant cash outflows during 2021 most of which may not be reimbursed or otherwise paid for by our partners or collaborators 

we believe that our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2020 will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months from the issuance of our financial statements we are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors including expenses related to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic which may adversely affect our business our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forwardlooking statement and involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 

if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis we may be required to finance future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings structured financings and debt financings government funding arrangements potential future strategic alliances from which we receive upfront fees milestone payments and other forms of consideration and marketing manufacturing distribution and licensing arrangements if we are required to finance future cash needs additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our investigational medicines or slow down or cease work on one or more of our programs if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders or increased fixed payment obligations and any such securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock if we incur indebtedness we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise funds through strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams research programs or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us any of these events could significantly harm our business financial condition and prospects 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2020 we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2020 and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



 

1 the amounts in the table include a total payment of 3389 million associated with our mtc south and mtc north leases for the optional lease extension periods for accounting purpose a lease term is the noncancelable period of the lease and includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that an option will be exercised please refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements 

2 the amounts represent noncancelable fixed payment obligations related to purchases of raw materials contract manufacturing services clinical services and other goods or services in the normal course of business 

under our strategic collaboration agreements we are committed to perform certain research development and manufacturing activities as part of our personalized mrna cancer vaccines or pcv collaboration and license agreement with merck we are committed to perform certain research development and manufacturing activities related to pcv products through an initial phase 2 clinical trial up to a budgeted amount of 2430 million as of december 31 2020 please refer to note 5 to the consolidated financial statements the expenses we expect to incur as part of our commitments under the pcv and other collaboration agreements were not included in the above table as we are not able to determine the timing and amounts of such expenses 

we have agreements with certain vendors for various services including services related to clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs under such agreements we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors mainly to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation the exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated at december 31 2020 we had cancelable open purchase orders of 8969 million in total under such agreements for our clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing these amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay at december 31 2020 assuming we would not cancel these agreements the actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the cancelable open purchase order amounts of 8969 million 

in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

interest rate risk 

our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2020 and 2019 we had cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments in marketable securities of 525 billion and 126 billion respectively our investment portfolio comprises money market funds and marketable debt securities including us treasury securities debt securities of us government agencies and corporate entities and commercial paper which are classified as availableforsale securities our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity and our investment policy defines allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to have very low risk exposure we generally hold investments in marketable debt securities to maturity to limit our exposure to interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates 

our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase due to the shortterm maturities and low risk profiles of our investments we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by one percentage point from levels at december 31 2020 and 2019 the net fair value of our interest sensitive marketable securities would not experience a material change in fair market value 

foreign currency risk 

our revenue generating activities and operations have been primarily denominated in us dollars as we expand internationally our results of operations and cash flows will become increasingly subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates to help manage the exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations we have implemented a balance sheet hedging program 

balance sheet hedging activities 

we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk associated with foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange risks there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations we believe the counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks while we believe the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not material a sustained decline in the financial stability of financial institutions as a result of disruption in the financial markets could affect our ability to secure creditworthy counterparties for our foreign currency hedging programs 

as of december 31 2020 a hypothetical adverse movement of 10 percent in foreign currency exchange rates compared to the us dollars across all maturities would have resulted in potential declines in the fair value on our foreign currency forward contracts used in balance sheet hedging of approximately 365 million we expect that any increase or decrease in the fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by increases or decreases in the underlying exposures being hedged we did not have any foreign currency hedge activities prior to 2020

 item 9a controls and procedures 

evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 

our management with the participation of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2020 the term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in rules 13a15e and 15d15e under the securities exchange act of 1934 or the exchange act means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the sec’s rules and forms disclosure controls and procedures include without limitation controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management including its principal executive and principal financial officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure management recognizes that any controls and procedures no matter how well designed and operated can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the costbenefit relationship of possible controls and procedures based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december 31 2020 our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of such date our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level 

management’s report on internal control over financial reporting 

our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange act rule 13a15f to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles management assessed our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 management based its assessment on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 2013 framework based on that evaluation our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december 31 2020 

the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december 31 2020 has been audited by ernst  young llp an independent registered public accounting firm as stated in their report included in this annual report on form 10k 

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

during the three months ended december 31 2020 we implemented certain internal controls in connection with our inventory capitalization product sales and derivative financial instruments there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the three months ended december 31 2020 which have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer believe that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level however our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how wellconceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by the collusion of two or more people or by a management override of the controls the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

 item 1 business 

the mrna opportunity 

mrna the software of life 

messenger rna or mrna transfers the information stored in our genes to the cellular machinery that makes all the proteins required for life our genes are stored as sequences of dna which contain the instructions to make specific proteins dna serves as a hard drive safely storing these instructions in the nucleus until they are needed by the cell 

when a cell needs to produce a protein the instructions to make that protein are copied from the dna to mrna which serves as the template for protein production each mrna molecule contains the instructions to produce a specific protein with a distinct function in the body mrna transmits those instructions to cellular machinery called ribosomes that make copies of the required protein 

we see mrna functioning as the “software of life” every cell uses mrna to provide real time instructions to make the proteins necessary to drive all aspects of biology including in human health and disease this was codified as the central dogma of molecular biology over 50 years ago and is exemplified in the schematic below 

mrna is used to make every type of protein including secreted membrane and intracellular proteins in varying quantities over time in different locations and in various combinations this is shown in the figure below 

given its essential role we believe mrna could be used to create a new class of medicines with significant potential to improve the lives of patients over the last 40 years the biotechnology industry has created a new category of drugs based on recombinant protein technology these drugs rely on secreted proteins including antibodies and protein replacements to treat a wide range of diseases this category of drugs accounts for over 200 billion in annual worldwide sales however intracellular and membrane proteins represent as much as twothirds of the proteins in humans and are largely beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology based on the ability of mrna to produce these proteins directly in cells we believe that mrnabased medicines have the potential to help patients in ways that could equal or exceed the impact of recombinant proteinbased drugs 

the structure of mrna 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprising four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the molecule that codes for a protein or the coding region the sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons the first codon or start codon aug signals where the ribosome should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein to end protein synthesis three different codons uaa uag and uga serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis in total there are 64 potential codons but only 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins therefore multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid 

the process of protein production is called translation because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids as shown in the figure below the coding region is analogous to a sentence in english much like a start codon a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

the intrinsic advantages of using mrna as a medicine 

we believe mrna possesses inherent characteristics that could serve as the foundation for a new class of medicines these characteristics include 

 as a result mrna could have many of the attractive pharmacologic features of most modern medicines including reproducible activity predictable potency and wellbehaved dose dependency and the ability to adjust dosing based on an individual patient’s needs including stopping or lowering the dose to seek to ensure safety and tolerability 

mrna as a new class of medicines 

based on these and other features we have developed four core beliefs about the value drivers of mrna as a new class of medicines 



 recombinant proteinbased drugs significantly advanced patient care and transformed the biopharmaceutical industry we believe that the development of mrna as a new class of medicines could represent another breakthrough for patients and our industry 

our strategic principles and approach to managing risk 

our strategy is designed to deliver on the full scope of the mrna opportunity over the longterm reaching patients with mrna medicines requires us to make complex choices including how much capital we devote to technology creation drug discovery drug development and infrastructure which programs we advance and how whether we advance programs alone or with strategic collaborators and which capabilities we build internally versus outsource 

to navigate these choices we established five strategic principles that guide our approach to creating longterm value for patients and investors no single strategic principle dominates our choices embedded in every decision we make is also our assessment of the most important risks inherent in our business we believe these risks fall into four categories technology biology execution and financing 

to increase our chances of success we often find it necessary to balance our neartomidterm risks against the strategic principles that guide our approach to longterm value creation 

our strategic principles 

 our approach to managing risk 

in conjunction with the strategic principles that guide our approach to longterm value creation we actively manage the risks inherent in our business at present these categories of risk include technology biology execution and financing we summarize our approach to managing these risks below 



 there is no single strategic principle nor single category of risk that dominates our decisionmaking and universal rules do not exist across our portfolio our tradeoffs generally involve balancing nearterm risks and longterm value creation because development cycles are long our choices are complex we expect the weighting and types of risk we face will evolve as our business matures we believe that disciplined capital allocation across near and longterm choices must be a core competency if we are to maximize the opportunity for patient impact and shareholder value creation 

our progress 

we are encouraged by our results to date across the six modalities that we have established we have 23  programs in development and manufactured dozens of drug substance lots for use in indenabling good laboratory practice or glp toxicology studies “indenabling” refers to studies required for investigational new drug application or ind or equivalent nonus regulatory filings such as a clinical trial application or cta we and our strategic collaborators have completed indenabling glp toxicology programs to support our open inds andor ctas for our development candidates manufactured dozens of current good manufacturing practice or cgmp batches of clinical trial materials and have 12  programs in clinical trials and another one  with an open ind over 1500 subjects have been enrolled in our clinical trials to fund these activities we have raised over 32 billion  as of december 31 2019  including 24 billion  from equity issuances and 08 billion  in upfront payments milestone payments and option exercise fees from strategic collaborators 

our platform 

overview of our platform 

our “platform” refers to our accumulated knowledge and capabilities in basic and applied sciences across mrna the delivery of mrna to target tissues and the manufacturing processes for making potential mrna medicines we invest in basic science to discover foundational mechanistic insights and we invest in applied sciences to invent technology that harnesses those insights we use our platform to identify and develop new mrna medicines when we identify a combination of platform technologies or programs across mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes that can enable shared product features across multiple potential mrna medicines we group those programs as a modality the primary goal of our platform is to identify new modalities and to expand the utility of our existing modalities we are committed to advancing the technological frontier of mrna medicines over the long term 

we define success in our platform as achieving the following pharmacologic properties 

 achieving any of these pharmacologic properties requires many often interdependent technological solutions we organize our efforts into three core scientific areas mrna delivery and manufacturing process as shown in the figure below 

we pursue mrna science both to minimize undesirable activation of the immune system by mrna and to maximize the mrna potency of mrna once inside target cells we pursue delivery science to protect mrna from extracellular enzymes that would degrade it to avoid counterproductive interactions of our delivery vehicles with the immune system deliver mrna to desired tissues and facilitate mrna transport across cell membranes to the translational machinery within cells finally we have learned that the methods for producing mrna and lipid nanoparticle or lnp delivery systems can have profound positive and negative effects on pharmacology we pursue process science to optimize these features for our future medicines and to develop technical capabilities to scale our potential mrna medicines for clinical development 

we have incurred over 5000 million of expense to advance our platform technology and our intellectual property this investment has underpinned the creation of all six of our existing modalities and helped us to establish fundamental intellectual property we intend to sustain our investment in our platform in the future because we believe we can establish new modalities and continue to make meaningful improvements in the performance of our current modalities 

the success of our current platform and the current pipeline of over 20  programs that it underpins depends on hundreds of small advances in our three core scientific areas examples of many critical advances that we have made are described below these advances demonstrate our significant progress to date and exemplify our approach to tackling hundreds of smaller scientific problems and organizing them into technological solutions 

our platform mrna science 

an overview of mrna biology 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprised of four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the mrna molecule that serves as instructions for protein synthesis the coding region the exact sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons one codon the start codon aug serves to signal where the ribosome should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids this process is called translation finally three different codons uaa uag and uga can serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis the production of proteins from mrna sequences is called translation and is used to make all human proteins the production of mrna from dna is called transcription 

as shown in the figure below the coding region in an mrna molecule is analogous to a sentence in english the start codon indicates the start of the protein much like a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

in every cell hundreds of thousands of mrnas make hundreds of millions of proteins every day a typical protein contains 200600 amino acids therefore a typical mrna coding region ranges from 6001800 nucleotides 

in addition to the coding region mrnas contain four other key features 1 the 5’ untranslated region or 5’utr 2 the 3’ untranslated region or 3’utr 3 the 5’ cap and 4 a 3’ polyadenosine or polya tail the sequence of nucleotides in the 5’utr influences how efficiently the ribosome initiates protein synthesis whereas the sequence of nucleotides in the 3’utr contains information about which cell types should translate that mrna and how long the mrna should last the 5’ cap and 3’ polya tail enhance ribosome engagement and protect the mrna from attack by intracellular enzymes that digest mrna from its ends 

as a result of this biology mrna has several key features first mrna is exquisitely specific there is a onetoone correspondence between an mrna molecule and the protein dictated by the coding sequence second the biological effects of mrna are amplified because each mrna copy can be translated thousands of times we believe that in some cases a small number of mrna copies per cell may be sufficient to induce a pharmacologic effect finally mrna is impermanent mrnas produce proteins for a defined and biologicallyregulated period of time without risk of changing genes or cell dna if dosing of mrna stops protein production will stop and the biological effects generally can be reversed 

decades of academic investigation have uncovered the basic mechanisms of mrna translation parallel efforts have uncovered how the innate immune system determines selfmrna versus foreign rna from rnabased viruses we are grateful for the deep scientific foundation established by these pioneers yet as we seek to develop mrna into medicines we often find ourselves at the frontiers of current understanding therefore we invest in both applied and basic research seeking to advance both the state of our technology and the state of the scientific community’s understanding of mrna examples of advances in mrna science that combine nucleotide chemistry sequence engineering and targeting elements are described below

the innate immune system has evolved to protect cells from foreign rna such as viral rna by inducing inflammation and suppressing mrna translation once detected many cells surveil their environment through sensors called tolllikereceptors or tlrs these include types that are activated by the presence of doublestranded rna tlr3 or uridine containing rna fragments tlr7 tlr8 additionally all cells have cytosolic doublestranded rna sensors including retinoic acid inducible genei or rigi that are sensitive to foreign rna inside the cell 

the immune and cellular response to mrna is complex context specific and often linked to the sensing of uridine to minimize undesired immune responses to our potential mrna medicines our platform employs chemicallymodified uridine nucleotides to minimize recognition by both immune cell sensors such as tlr378 and broadlydistributed cytosolic receptors such as rigi mrna produced using our synthesis technologies and containing unmodified uridine results in significant upregulation of secreted cytokines such as ip10 as shown in the figure below administration of monocytederived macrophages or mdms with unmodified mrna formulated in lnps results in an increased ratio of ip10 transcripts relative to a housekeeping gene by substituting unmodified uridine with a modified uridine we can substantially reduce immune cell activation in this assay the control contains 

only transfection agent and no mrna in multiple preclinical experiments we have demonstrated reduced immune cell activation including of b cells lower immunoglobulin secretion and lower cytokine expression when administering mrna made with modified uridine versus unmodified uridine to date when deploying these technologies we have yet to observe doselimiting toxicity attributable to the mrna encoding proteins from our drug substance even at the exaggerated doses in indenabling glp toxicology programs importantly in preclinical testing our chemicallymodified uridine has not significantly affected the ribosome’s ability to read and translate the mrna sequence

mrna sequence engineering maximizing protein expression 

mrna exists transiently in the cytoplasm during which time it can be translated into thousands of proteins before eventually being degraded our platform applies bioinformatic biochemical and biological screening capabilities most of which have been invented internally that aim to optimize the amount of protein produced per mrna we have identified proprietary sequences for the 5’utr that have been observed to increase the likelihood that a ribosome bound to the 5’end of the mrna transcript will find the desired start codon and reliably initiate translation of the coding region 

we additionally design the nucleotide sequence of the coding region to maximize its successful translation into protein as previously described there are often multiple codons that encode for a specific amino acid the amount of protein produced by an mrna sequence is known to be partly determined by the codons it uses with certain codons being more or less common in endogenous mrnas we have found that the amount of protein produced is also determined by the secondary structure of mrna or the propensity of mrna to fold on itself with more structured mrnas producing more protein we designed a set of sequences which independently varied codon usage and structure of the mrna as shown in the figure below protein expression in the alpha mouse liver 12 cell line is highest for sequences containing more commonly occurring codons and also more structured mrna both codon usage and structure have an independent and additive effect on protein expression shown as mean expression solid line as measured by fluorescence of the expressed protein with 95 confidence interval in gray the total expression area under the curve or auc and standard error of the mean for auc are shown for each quadrant in relative fluorescence units per hour by optimizing translation initiation and efficiency we have further increased the average number of fulllength desired proteins expressed per molecule mrna this permits us to reduce the mrna doses required to achieve the same therapeutic benefit 

sequences with more structure and more common codons in mrna maximize protein expression  in vitro 

targeting elements enabling tissuetargeted translation 

all nucleated cells in the body are capable of translating mrna resulting in pharmacologic activity in any cell in which mrna is delivered and translated to minimize or prevent potential offtarget effects our platform employs technologies that regulate mrna translation in select cell types cells often contain short rna sequences called micrornas or mirnas that bind to mrna to regulate protein translation at the mrna level different cell types have different concentrations of specific micrornas in effect giving cells a microrna signature microrna binding directly to mrna effectively silences or reduces mrna translation and promotes mrna degradation we design microrna binding sites into the 3’utr of our potential mrna medicines so that if our mrna is delivered to cells with such micrornas it will be minimally translated and rapidly degraded 

as an example we have demonstrated by intratumoral administration in an animal model that an mrna encoding a cytotoxic protein and containing a microrna binding site can be used to selectively kill cancer cells while protecting systemic tissues such as liver cells in a mouse model of cancer hep3b subcutaneous xenograft mouse liver enzyme levels and immunohistochemistry or ihc of cleaved caspase3 indicate production of an apoptosisinducing protein encoded by mrna in tumor cells but not healthy liver cells when the mrna has multiple mir122 target sites this is denoted as 3x122ts in the figure below mir122 is more prevalent in noncancerous liver cells but absent in the cancerous liver cells we published this work in  nucleic acid therapeutics  in 2018

and microrna binding sites in mouse study 

our platform delivery science 

we focus on the delivery of our mrna molecules to specific tissues our mrna can in specific instances such as our vegf therapeutic be delivered by direct injection to a tissue in a simple saline formulation without lipid nanoparticles or lnps to locally produce small amounts of pharmacologically active protein however the blood and interstitial fluids in humans contain significant rna degrading enzymes that rapidly degrade any extracellular mrna and prevent broader distribution without lnps additionally cell membranes tend to act as a significant barrier to entry of large negativelycharged molecules such as mrna we have therefore invested heavily in delivery science and have developed lnp technologies as well as alternative nanoparticle approaches to enable delivery of larger quantities of mrna to target tissues 

lnps are generally composed of four components an amino lipid a phospholipid cholesterol and a pegylatedlipid or peglipid each component as well as the overall composition or mix of components contributes to the properties of each lnp system lnps containing mrna injected into the body rapidly bind proteins that can drive uptake of lnps into cells once internalized in endosomes within cells the lnps are designed to escape the endosome and release their mrna cargo into the cell cytoplasm where the mrna can be translated to make a protein and have the desired therapeutic effect any mrna and lnp components that do not escape the endosome are typically delivered to lysosomes where they are degraded by the natural process of cellular digestion 

examples of tools we developed by using our platform include proprietary lnp formulations that address the steps of mrna delivery including cell uptake endosomal escape and subsequent lipid metabolism and for avoidance of counterproductive interactions with the immune system examples of delivery tools we have developed are described below 

chemistry novel lipid chemistry to potentially improve safety and tolerability 

we initially used lnp formulations that were based on known lipid systems which we refer to as “legacy lnps” a recognized limitation of these legacy lnps is the potential for inflammatory reactions upon single and repeat administration that can impact tolerability and therapeutic index our laterdeveloped proprietary lnp systems are therefore designed to be highly tolerated and minimize any lnp vehiclerelated toxicities with repeat administration  in vivo  the changes we made have included engineering amino lipids to avoid the immune system and to be rapidly biodegradable relative to prior lipids as shown in the figure below administered intravenously in nonhuman primates at 02 mgkg our proprietary lnps demonstrate rapid clearance of the lipid from panel a plasma and b various organs 12 hours post administration

even in the case of vaccines where one might hypothesize that lnpinduced immune stimulation could potentially increase the effectiveness of the vaccine we have demonstrated in preclinical studies that we can maintain the desired immune response to the vaccine while reducing undesired local immune reaction or reactogenicity to the lnp as shown in the figure below representative histology sections in the muscle stained with hematoxalin and eosin two days after a single intramuscular administration in rats demonstrated less inflammation and muscle cell necrosis with our proprietary lnps vs legacy lnps containing 01 mg of our mrna as exemplified in the box with the legacy lnp in panel a necrosis and degeneration of muscle cells and inflammation were observed dotted box with our proprietary lnps inflammation dotted box and muscle cell necrosis were less extensive serum cytokine levels shown in panel b are lower with our proprietary lnps vs legacy lnps

composition proprietary lnps enhance delivery efficiency 

our platform includes extensive inhouse expertise in medicinal chemistry which we have applied to design large libraries of novel lipids using these libraries in combination with our discovery biology capabilities we have conducted high throughput screens for desired lnp properties and believe that we have made fundamental discoveries in preclinical studies about the relationships between structural motifs of lipids and lnp performance for protein expression by screening for components and compositions that enhance the amount of mrna delivered per cell and protein expression we have demonstrated with intravenous administration up to a sixfold improvement in protein production over the prior state of the art for lnps as shown in the figure below n3 rats 95 ci shown 

enhanced protein production with our proprietary lnp in rat study 

surface properties novel lnp design to avoid immune recognition 

we have designed our proprietary lnp systems for sustained pharmacology upon repeat dosing by eliminating or altering features that activate the immune system these are based on insights into the surface properties of lnps upon repeated dosing surface features on traditional lnps such as amino lipids phospholipids and peglipids can be recognized by the immune system leading to rapid clearance from the bloodstream a decrease in potency upon repeat dosing and an increase in inflammation 

based on our insights into these mechanisms we have engineered our lnp systems to reduce or eliminate undesirable surface features in preclinical studies in nonhuman primates for our systemic therapeutic development candidates that use our novel lnp systems we have been able to repeat dose with negligible or undetectable loss in potency liver damage and immune system activation 

our platform manufacturing process science 

we invest significantly in manufacturing process science to impart more potent features to our mrna and lnps and to invent the technological capabilities necessary to manufacture our potential mrna medicines at scales ranging from micrograms to kilograms as well as achieve pharmaceutical properties such as solubility and shelf life we view developing these goals of manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties as stage appropriate for each program in some cases this includes inventing novel analytical technologies that make it possible to connect analytical characterization of mrna and lnps to biological performance 

mrna manufacturing process improving pharmacology 

our platform creates mrna using a cellfree approach called  in vitro  transcription in which an rna polymerase enzyme binds to and transcribes a dna template adding the nucleotides encoded by the dna to the growing rna strand following transcription we employ proprietary purification techniques to ensure that our mrna is free from undesired synthesis components and impurities that could activate the immune system in an indiscriminate manner applying our understanding of the basic science underlying each step in the manufacturing process we have designed proprietary manufacturing processes to impart desirable pharmacologic features for example increasing potency in a vaccine using a model antigen injected intramuscularly in mice at a 3 µg mrna dose the figure below shows the significant improvement in cd8 t cell response we have achieved through mrna manufacturing process science and engineering as evidenced by process b 

manufacturing process changes to tune immune response in mouse study 

lnp manufacturing process improving pharmacology 

our platform technology includes synthetic processes to produce lnps traditionally lnps are assembled by dissolving the four molecular components amino lipid phospholipid cholesterol and peglipid in ethanol and then mixing this with mrna in an aqueous buffer the resulting mixture is then purified to isolate lnps from impurities such impurities include molecular components that have not been incorporated into particles unencapsulated mrna that could activate the immune system and particles outside of the desired size range 

going beyond optimization of traditional manufacturing processes we have invested in understanding and measuring the various biochemical and physical interactions during lnp assembly and purification we have additionally developed stateoftheart analytical techniques necessary to characterize our lnps and biological systems to analyze their  in vitro  and  in vivo  performance with these insights we have identified manufacturing process parameters that drive lnp performance for example the potency in a secreted therapeutic setting these insights have allowed us to make significant improvements in the potency of our lnps as exemplified in the figure below for example expression of a secreted protein in our relaxin program azd7970 demonstrates an approximate eightfold increase in auc and approximate sixfold increase in maximum concentration for manufacturing process y versus manufacturing process x in rats dosed intravenously with 05 mgkg mrna 

manufacturing process changes to enhance relaxin protein production by mrna in rat study 

our platform progress to date 

since our inception we have solved numerous interdependent problems related to the pharmacologic features of our potential mrna medicines these features are detailed and exemplified below please also see the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” for recent clinical results for our investigational medicines including cmv vaccine mrna1647 hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 and pcv mrna4157 utilizing moderna proprietary technology 

  dosedependent protein expression at clinically relevant levels 

we have demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to generate consistent dosedependent levels of protein which is particularly important for therapeutics a recent example is from our indenabling nonhuman primate study for our antibody against chikungunya virus program mrna1944 we demonstrated linear dosedependence meaning three and tenfold increases in the dose of mrna led to three and tenfold increases in antibody as shown in the figure below at the top dose antibody levels reached 

162 ± 46 µgml sd following first dose 0 hours and effectively doubled to 288 ± 100 µgml upon second dose 168 hours this dose regimen also maintained antibody trough levels above 2 µgml for 100 days in nonhuman primates a level consistent with clinically efficacious levels of many approved antibodies all doses 03 1 and 3 mgkg tested in nonhuman primates showed no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna1944 and all other observations were generally reversible

reproducible pharmacology including upon repeated dosing 

by combining advances in mrna delivery and manufacturing process science we have demonstrated in preclinical studies sustained and reproducible pharmacology the figure below shows a recent example in a mouse model that recapitulates metabolic defects in propionic acidemia or pa in this rare disease a defect in one or both of two different subunits pcca and pccb of the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase results in accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 2methylcitrate or 2mc in mice hypomorphic for the pcca subunit monthly intravenous or iv administration of mrnas encoding pcca and pccb formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna3927 resulted in a significant and sustained lowering of 2mc throughout the duration of the 6month study compared to control luciferase mrna 1 mgkg n6group

decreased immune activation upon repeat dosing in nonhuman primates 

we have observed decreased immune activation with repeat dosing in nonhuman primates as shown in the figure below panel a indicates serum concentration of human erythropoietin or hepo with repeat dosing of mrna encoding hepo in our proprietary lnps with weekly iv administration at 02 mgkg in nonhuman primates panels b and c demonstrate comparable serum concentrations of mcp1 promoting immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation and c5b9 indicative of innate immune activation via the complement system with our proprietary lnp at 02 mgkg weekly iv infusion in nonhuman primates vs legacy lnp

in addition to this example we have completed multiple indenabling toxicology studies under glp for our two systemic therapeutics modalities for many such programs the no adverse event level was the top dose tested generally 2 mgkg or higher we believe that by combining proprietary mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing process technologies we have significantly advanced the potential therapeutic index of our potential mrnabased therapeutics 

pharmacologic activity in the target tissue and cell 

while some of our modalities such as systemic secreted therapeutics can leverage many different cell types to make therapeutic proteins others such as systemic intracellular therapeutics may require delivery of our mrna into specific tissues for instance hepatocytes in certain liver metabolic diseases combining our proprietary mrna delivery and manufacturing process technologies we have observed ontarget pharmacologic activity in hepatocytes in nonhuman primates the ontarget potency of this approach 

contrasts with traditional delivery technologies in the figure below our proprietary lnp and process result in mrna delivery to and protein expression in liver hepatocytes in nonhuman primates as demonstrated with a reporter mrna detected by  in situ  hybridization and a reporter protein detected by immunohistochemistry at 12 hours after iv infusion at 05 mgkg 

mrna delivery to and protein expression in hepatocytes with our proprietary lnps in nonhuman primate study 

our platform’s future improving and expanding our modalities 

we are committed to sustaining investment in our platform both in basic science to elucidate new mechanistic insights and in applied science to discover new technologies that harness these insights our platform investments have enabled six modalities to date most of which have already led to multiple development candidates and investigational medicines in our pipeline we believe that sustaining our investment in platform research and development will enable further improvements in the current modalities and will lead to the creation of new modalities both of which will benefit our clinical pipeline in the years ahead 

creating modalities with shared product features 

our approach to developing modalities 

within our platform we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features we call that group a “ modality ” while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases they share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals as well as pharmaceutical properties programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk we have created six modalities to date 

 when entering into a new modality our approach is consistent with our strategic principles and perspectives on risk management discussed previously the tenets of our approach are summarized below 

 illustrating our approach from our first modality to today 

we started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality because we believed this modality faced lower technical hurdles relative to other areas our early formulations of mrna tended to stimulate the immune system which would present a challenge to therapeutics but was a desired feature for vaccines in addition many potential prophylactic vaccine antigens are wellcharacterized allowing us to reduce biology risk lastly the dosing regimens for vaccines require as few as one or two administrations and generally involve relatively low doses 

for our first programs in this modality we chose our h10n8 and h7n9 pandemic influenza vaccines each requiring expression of a single membrane protein we chose to pursue two programs in two separate but parallel clinical trials to establish the flexibility of our platform 

when both programs met our goals for safety tolerability and pharmacology we accelerated and expanded our vaccine pipeline to include multiple commercially meaningful and increasingly complex vaccines these included a combination vaccine designed to protect against two unrelated respiratory viruses human metapneumovirus or hmpv and human parainfluenza 3 or piv3 and a vaccine that combines six different mrnas our cytomegalovirus or cmv vaccine to express a complex pentameric antigen we also sought strategic alliances with defense advanced research projects or darpa biomedical advanced research development authority or barda and merck  co or merck to allow us to rapidly expand our pipeline and complement our capabilities with their expertise 

over time we have taken on more challenging applications and technological hurdles with each successive modality but we have also tried to build upon our prior experiences to manage risk for example in our cancer vaccines modality we are now applying our technology to elicit t cell responses to potentially recognize and eradicate cancer as a logical extension of our prophylactic vaccines 

modality having demonstrated local expression of protein in our vaccines we expanded into local therapeutic applications for example in our intratumoral immunooncology modality we are seeking to use local expression to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming tumor microenvironments we can also use local expression to drive regenerative processes as in our vascular endothelial growth factor a or vegfa program most recently we have expanded into two new modalities that use systemic delivery of mrna to encode secreted and cell surface or intracellular proteins we have moved multiple programs in these areas into development for the treatment of diseases as varied as rare genetic disorders preventing viral infections or treating heart failure 

expanding within our designated core modalities 

in 2019 we believe that positive phase 1 data from our infectious disease vaccine portfolio including our cmv vaccine and chikungunya antibody program reduced the risk of our prophylactic vaccines and systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modalities which we have now designated core modalities in these core modalities our strategy is to invest in additional development candidates using our accumulated innovations in technology our process insights and our preclinical and clinical experience as such we have brought five new development candidates forward in early 2020 interleukin2 “il2” programmed deathligand 1 “pdl1” a pediatric respiratory syncytial virus “rsv” vaccine an epsteinbarr virus “ebv” vaccine and a sarscov2 vaccine as part of our mission to use our technology to advance global public health our exploratory modalities continue to be a critical part of advancing our strategy to maximize the application of our potential mrna medicines 

how modalities continue to build our pipeline 

we believe our portfolio of modalities—each with distinct technological and biological risk profiles—allows us to maximize longterm value for patients and investors we see our six current modalities as six distinct multiproduct pipelines that represent different risk profiles and benefit from common infrastructure and a shared platform technology we believe the high technology correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of the pipeline in that modality based on learnings from the initial programs we believe the lower technology correlation between modalities allows us to compartmentalize the technology risks 

we believe our ongoing investments in our platform will lead to the identification of additional new modalities in the future and will expand the diversity of our pipeline 

executing on our broad pipeline 

in order to capitalize on the breadth of the mrna opportunity we built a set of capabilities across the drug development value chain to enable us to efficiently execute on many pipeline programs in parallel 

mrnas encode proteins across diverse biology using the same chemical building blocks arranged into different sequences this lends itself to common rules when designing a new mrna medicine and common processes for manufacturing we have invested in scalable infrastructure built on a digital backbone and enabled by automation to advance a large pipeline of mrna programs in parallel 

our capabilities and infrastructure are grouped into three basic units or engines that are applied at different stages of the drug development value chain as shown in the following figure 

our current pipeline programs utilize our research engine and early development engine we are starting to build the late stage development and commercial engine to handle the further advancement of our programs each of these engines integrates critical internal capabilities with outsourced flexible capacity 

our  research engine  enables us to advance new product ideas into development candidates via our drug discovery efforts and includes infrastructure to enable rapid supply of thousands of preclinical mrnas for research involving  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments in order to accelerate programs from idea to development candidate designation 

our  early development engine  enables progression of preclinical development candidates to investigational medicines upon ind filing or its equivalent through early clinical trials that seek to demonstrate human proof of concept or hpoc this includes internal and outsourced infrastructure for indenabling glp toxicology studies the scale up and cgmp manufacture of the investigational medicine initial regulatory submissions and the execution of clinical trials 

our  late stage development and commercial engine  is being built to enable progress of our investigational medicines from hpoc through latestage development to approval and eventual commercialization catalyzed by our progress with our cmv vaccine program toward a phase 3 clinical trial we are establishing internal infrastructure for cgmp manufacturing of late stage development supply of products regulatory submissions and capabilities to execute later stage clinical trials commercial supply investments will be planned in the future 

all of these engines are supported and enabled by our integrated digital investments our focus on highly talented and motivated team members and our deep capital base 

our  digital infrastructure  facilitates efficient integration and control of virtually every aspect of what we do we design and implement digital operations to control or support complex workflows accelerate learnings across our enterprise realtime and provide deeper insights through analytical tools artificial intelligence and custom automation 

our  talented employees  drive our mission across this value chain for patients and investors our culture also plays an invaluable role in our execution at all levels in our organization an example of our commitment to the development of our employees is our investment in moderna university our extensive program of internal and external course offerings curated to meet the learning and development needs of our people 

our  capital  from our investors and strategic collaborators enables the scale required to execute on our pipeline we sought and continue to seek diverse funding sources of approximately 32 billion  in cash we have received through december 31 2019  08 billion  has been in the form of upfront payments milestone payments and option exercise payments from strategic collaborators such 

as astrazeneca and merck and 24 billion  has been from equity issuances in both private and public markets to a diverse set of global investors as of december 31 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 13 billion  

examples of our proprietary infrastructure 

our drug design studio enables rapid design of multiple mrnas 

as our scientists create new mrna concepts they can design mrnas for research and testing within days using our proprietary systems we utilize the softwarelike property of mrna in our proprietary webbased drug design studio our scientists request mrnas for a specific protein and the protein target is automatically converted to an initial optimized mrna sequence using our sequence designer module they can tailor entire mrnas from the 5’utr to the coding region to the 3’utr based on our everimproving proprietary learnings the mrna sequence is then further optimized using our proprietary bioinformatics algorithms our digital ordering then ensures rapid and accurate transmission of sequences to our modular synthesis robotics 

our high throughput systems facilitate rapid synthesis of research grade mrna 

once our scientists design mrnas we make them at a small scale to test them in cells or in animal models to see if our ideas will work we integrated the drug design studio mrna sequence into a modular synthesis system comprised of custom highthroughput automation for making up to 1000 orders of unique mrna sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks at 11000 mg per lot the amounts required for testing in cells or animal models this has accelerated our learnings by allowing us to test many different mrnas in parallel 

our moderna technology center  “ mtc ”  manufacturing site in norwood ma provides modular and automated capacity that can scale with our pipeline 

manufacturing is strategically important to us and we believe we need to control a significant portion of our manufacturing supply chain we initially used an outsourced global supply chain to make our multicomponent mrna products however we believe that managing quality supply and timing in such a supply chain for cgmp material could increase our overall business risk accordingly we elected in 2016 to build our own manufacturing facility we opened our newly constructed 200000 square foot moderna technology center or mtc manufacturing facility in norwood ma in july 2018 and brought multiple cgmp suites online thereby providing integration of our supply chain from raw materials to filled vials at a single site we can make mrna lipids key raw materials and lnps at this site to control quality and supply while also potentially creating new manufacturing intellectual property in february 2019 based on our anticipated future growth we entered into a lease agreement for additional office and laboratory space nearby as part of our mtc facility in norwood totaling an additional approximately 200000 square feet we can readily flex the capacity at our mtc facility via its modular systems to produce up to 100 cgmp lots per year this capacity will support our current pipeline will enable significant future pipeline expansion and under certain scenarios could serve some commercial supply needs 

overview of our modalities 

at moderna we define a modality as a group of potential mrna medicines that share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features typically programs within a modality will also share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals and their pharmaceutical properties we have created six modalities to date 

 we believe our portfolio of modalities each with distinct technological and biological risk profiles allows us to maximize longterm value for patients and investors we see our six current modalities as six distinct multiproduct pipelines that represent different risk profiles and benefit from common infrastructure and a shared technology platform we believe the risk correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of the pipeline in that modality based on learnings from the initial programs we believe the lower risk correlation between modalities allows us to mitigate the risks of expanding into new areas the cell map illustration of our pipeline in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” depicts the diversity of the biology of our pipeline across our six modalities 

i prophylactic vaccines overview  core modality 

we designed our prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent or control infectious diseases this modality currently includes nine development candidates all of which are vaccines against viruses the goal of any vaccine is to safely preexpose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen called an antigen so that the immune system is prepared to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future and prevent infection or disease 

within this modality our portfolio includes programs for both commercial and global health uses we have strategic alliances with merck on select commercial vaccines and barda darpa the national institutes of health or nih as well as the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations or cepi on global health vaccine programs we have accumulated several innovations in technology have gained process insights and built a significant set of preclinical and clinical experiences in our prophylactic vaccines modality based on these we believe this modality is core to our portfolio and we have expanded this portfolio with three new development candidates in 2020 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

prophylactic vaccines opportunity 

vaccines to prevent infectious diseases are one of the great innovations of modern medicine in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322 million americans from falling ill 21 million hospitalizations 732000 deaths 295 billion of direct costs and 13 trillion in social costs the commercial opportunity for vaccines is significant with more than 35 billion in annual worldwide sales of vaccines and with 16 different vaccine franchises each generating more than 500 million in annual worldwide sales in 2017 more innovative vaccines have been able to achieve pricing per regimen generally ranging from 5 to 20 times that of seasonal flu vaccines 

prophylactic vaccines product features 

we believe mrnabased vaccines offer several advantages including 

 prophylactic vaccines status and next steps 

our prophylactic vaccines modality currently includes eight programs five of which have entered into clinical trials in addition to the eight programs being developed the h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 are two public health programs that are not being further developed without government or other funding of these programs we have demonstrated desired pharmacology in the form of immunogenicity in the phase 1 clinical trials for the following h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 rsv vaccine mrna1777 chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 and cmv vaccine mrna1647 for the zika vaccine mrna1325 although the phase 1 safety and tolerability 

data generated would permit additional dose escalation of mrna1325 our current development efforts are focused on our nextgeneration vaccine mrna1893 which has been shown to be 20 times more potent in nonhuman primate zika challenge studies we will not further develop mrna1325 we have an ongoing phase 1 trial for the next generation zika vaccine mrna1893 and merck is conducting a phase 1 trial for an additional rsv vaccine mrna1172 



for our commercial vaccine programs we expect the next series of milestones will involve the reporting of phase 2 safety and immunogenicity data from our cmv vaccine mrna1647 and phase 1b safety and immunogenicity data for our hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 for the programs being conducted by our strategic collaborator merck the next milestones will be the safety and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 trial for the second rsv vaccine mrna1172 which has been shown to be more potent than the first mrna1777 in preclinical studies for our global health programs the next series of milestones will involve the reporting of phase 1 safety and immunogenicity data for our next generation zika vaccine mrna1893 and phase 1 safety and potential immunogenicity data for our sarscov2 vaccine mrna1273 we do not intend to advance our h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 our h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 or our chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 through further clinical development without government or other thirdparty funding 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

ii cancer vaccines overview  exploratory modality 

we designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens defined below this modality has two programs currently for neoantigen vaccines a personalized cancer vaccine or pcv program and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called kras both conducted in collaboration with merck the goal of a cancer vaccine is to safely expose the patient’s immune system to tumor related antigens known as neoantigens to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response this exploratory modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique to a patient as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

cancer vaccines opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from checkpoint inhibitors as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available therapies in addition treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms principally the local immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells which prevent either access to or recognition by t cells 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor t cell therapies have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens 

cancer vaccines product features 

we believe that mrna technology is an attractive approach for cancer vaccines for many reasons including

we are currently developing two programs within our cancer vaccines modality our personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 is being developed in collaboration with merck and is in a multiplearm phase 1 trial a second personalized cancer vaccine nci4650 was being developed in collaboration with the national cancer institute or nci and was in an investigatorinitiated singlearm phase 1 trial which has been completed the two vaccines mrna4157 and nci4650 differ in the neoantigen selection protocols used but are otherwise substantially the same our second program within this modality mrna5671 is a kras vaccine our strategic collaborator merck has a phase 1 trial ongoing for mrna5671 



we expect the next steps for the pcv program mrna4157 to involve the continued reporting of immunogenicity data from the phase 1 clinical trial in cancer patients and the continuation of the randomized phase 2 trial to assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab improves relapsefree survival compared to pembrolizumab alone the next steps for the kras vaccine mrna5671 include continuation of the phase 1 trial by our strategic collaborator merck 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

iii intratumoral immunooncology overview  exploratory modality 

we designed our intratumoral immunooncology modality to treat or cure cancer by transforming the tumor microenvironment to drive anticancer t cell responses against tumors our mrna technology within this modality allows for the combination of multiple therapeutics that can be directly injected into a tumor with the goal of activating the tumor microenvironment to kill cancer cells in the injected tumor as well as in distal tumors known as the abscopal effect intratumoral administration allows for localized effect of these therapeutics that could be toxic if administered systemically this exploratory modality has three development candidates 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

intratumoral immunooncology opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 there have been several advances in the treatment of cancer through immunemediated therapies in recent years however the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer remains poor especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement and are sometimes termed immunologically “cold” we aim to activate the tumor microenvironment with our mrna therapeutics in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors 

intratumoral immunooncology product features 

we believe our approach to immunooncology using our mrna medicines could complement checkpoint inhibitors and has several advantages over recombinant proteinbased drugs including 

 intratumoral immunooncology status and next steps 

we have three programs in this modality the first program in this modality ox40l mrna2416 was designed to overcome technological challenges in advancing this modality including engineering the mrna sequence to minimize offtarget effects utilizing our proprietary lnps to enhance safety and tolerability and to demonstrate expression of a membrane protein in patients ox40l mrna2416 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase 12 trial in the united states and protein expression has been demonstrated in a number of patients our second program ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 has dosed patients in a phase 1 study for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma our third program il12 medi1191 is being developed in collaboration with astrazeneca 

  



the monotherapy arm of the phase 1 trial for mrna2416 has been completed and we are not planning an expansion cohort of mrna2416 as a monotherapy we have initiated a dosefinding cohort at 4 mg mrna2416 given in combination with durvalumab imfinzi® followed by a phase 2 expansion cohort in ovarian cancer we plan to collect phase 1 clinical trial data including potential clinical responses for ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 astrazeneca has initiated an openlabel multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral injections of il12 medi1191 alone or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

iv localized regenerative therapeutics overview  exploratory modality 

we designed our localized regenerative therapeutics modality to develop mrna medicines to address injured or diseased tissues our mrna technology in this modality allows for the local production of proteins that provide a therapeutic benefit in the targeted tissue the development of our program in this modality azd8601 for the local production of vegfa is being led by our strategic collaborator astrazeneca this program completed a phase 1ab clinical trial in which we observed both a dosedependent protein production and a pharmacologic effect as measured by changes in local blood flow in patients we believe this data provides clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

localized regenerative therapeutics opportunity 

there are multiple applications for tissue regeneration with astrazeneca we have focused on ischemic heart failure for the first program coronary artery disease the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle in 2015 coronary artery disease resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally 

localized regenerative therapeutics product features 

we believe our approach to localized regenerative therapeutics using mrna has several advantages over alternative approaches including 

 localized regenerative therapeutics status and next steps 

our localized vegfa program azd8601 which is being developed by astrazeneca has completed a phase 1ab trial to describe its safety tolerability protein production and activity in diabetic patients the study has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of demonstrating protein production and changes in blood flow post azd8601 administration in this trial azd8601 was administered by intradermal injection in the forearm skin of patients for single ascending doses these data are consistent with studies previously conducted in preclinical models we believe these data provide clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting    



astrazeneca has initiated a phase 2a trial for azd8601 in ischemic heart disease the phase 2a study is designed to provide initial safety and tolerability data in approximately 24 coronary artery bypass patients 

this program is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

v systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics overview  core modality 

we designed our systemic secreted therapeutics modality to increase levels of desired secreted proteins in circulation or in contact with the extracellular environment in order to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide secreted proteins such as antibodies or enzyme replacement therapies across a wide range of diseases such as heart failure infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases this modality has benefitted from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation we have accumulated several innovations in technology have gained process insights and have built a set of preclinical and clinical experiences in our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality based on these we believe this modality is core to our portfolio and we have expanded this portfolio with two new development candidates in a new autoimmune therapeutic area in 2020 our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality has five development candidates 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics opportunity 

the ability to systemically deliver mrna for a therapeutic effect would allow us to address a number of diseases of high unmet medical need systemically delivered secreted and cell surface therapeutics address conditions often treated with recombinant proteins that are typically administered to the blood stream these current therapies include for example 

 systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics product features 

systemically delivered secreted and cell surface therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins our potential advantages in these areas include 



systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics status and next steps

we expect the next steps for the antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 program will be additional phase 1 clinical trial safety and serum antibody level data we plan to file inds and take our programs for relaxin azd7970 fabry disease mrna3630 il2 mrna6231 and pdl1 mrna6981 into the clinic for phase 1 testing 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

vi systemic intracellular therapeutics overview  exploratory modality 

we designed our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality to increase levels of intracellular proteins using cells in the human body to produce proteins located in the cytosol or specific organelles of the cell to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide intracellular proteins such as intracellular enzymes and organellespecific proteins as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies our initial focus within this exploratory modality is on rare genetic diseases this modality currently has four programs 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic intracellular therapeutics opportunity 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics focus on areas currently not addressable with recombinant proteins which are typically administered systemically and cannot reach the inside of the cell objectives for potential new therapies in this area include for example increasing the levels of 

 systemic intracellular therapeutics product features 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins our potential advantages in these areas include 

 systemic intracellular therapeutics status and next steps 

we have four systemic intracellular therapeutics development candidates in our pipeline our intracellular programs address methylmalonic acidemia or mma mrna3704 propionic acidemia or pa mrna3927 phenylketonuria or pku mrna3283 and glycogen storage disorder type 1a or gsd1a mrna3745 



we have received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission for the mma program the fda has also designated the investigation of mrna3704 for the treatment of isolated mma due to mut deficiency as a fast track development program we have initiated a phase 12 trial for mma mrna3704 as of february 12 2020 we have enrolled the first patient in this trial this patient has entered an observational period prior to treatment which evaluates the patient’s baseline disease prior to starting the treatment period we expect the next steps for mrna3704 will be phase 12 clinical trial safety proof of concept and biomarker data we have received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission for the pa program the fda has also granted fast track designation to mrna3927 with an open ind currently we expect the next steps for mrna3927 to be initiation of the phase 1 clinical trial to describe safety proof of concept and biomarker data in pa patients we have an ongoing global natural history study for mma and pa up to 60 pa and 60 mma patients in the united states and europe will be followed prospectively for 13 years enrollment in this study has been completed retrospective data are being collected as available pku mrna3283 and gsd1a mrna3745 are currently in preclinical development we plan to file inds and take these programs into the clinic for phase 1 testing 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

our pipeline 

this section describes the pipeline that has emerged thus far from the combination of our strategy our platform our infrastructure and the resources we have amassed complete descriptions of our programs are found in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

since we nominated our first program in late 2014 we and our strategic collaborators have advanced in parallel a diverse development pipeline which currently consists of 24  development candidates across our 23  programs of which 17  have entered clinical studies and another one has an open investigational new drug application “ind” over 1500  subjects have been enrolled in our clinical trials since december 2015 our diverse pipeline comprises programs across six modalities and a broad range of therapeutic areas a modality is a group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features and the associated combination of mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes aspects of our pipeline have been supported through strategic alliances including with astrazeneca merck and vertex pharmaceuticals or vertex and governmentsponsored organizations and private foundations focused on global health initiatives including barda darpa nih cepi and the bill  melinda gates foundation 

our selection process for advancing new development candidates reflects both programspecific considerations as well as portfoliowide considerations programspecific criteria include among other relevant factors the severity of the unmet medical need the biology risk of our chosen target or disease the feasibility of clinical development the costs of development and the commercial opportunity portfoliowide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform components within a modality thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs in the modality and in some cases in other modalities 

the breadth of biology addressable using mrna technology is reflected in our current development pipeline of 23  programs these span 28 different proteins or protein complexes 11 different antigens including viruslike particles for infectious disease vaccines two different cancer vaccines one personalized cancer vaccine addressing neoantigens and one for a shared cancer antigen four different immunomodulator targets including membrane and systemically secreted proteins for immunooncology programs one secreted local regenerative factor for a heart failure program five secreted or cell surface proteins of diverse biology an antibody an engineered protein hormone a lysosomal enzyme a secreted cytokine and a cell surface receptor and four intracellular enzymes for rare disease programs the diversity of proteins made from mrna within our development pipeline is shown in the figure below 

the following chart shows our current pipeline of 24  development candidates across our 23  programs grouped into modalitiesfirst the 2 core modalities where we believe we have reduced the technology risk followed by the 4 exploratory modalities in which we are continuing to investigate the clinical use of mrna medicines 

  

portfoliowide evidence in support of our platform and approach 

we have generated significant learnings across our portfolio that we believe provide compelling support for our approach and pipeline across a broad array of human diseases 

we have generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity in the clinic for multiple programs in our core modality of prophylactic vaccines 

we have nine  development candidates in various stages of preclinical or clinical development two of which are being developed by our strategic collaborator merck in the prophylactic vaccines modality which is one of our core modalities in addition we have two development candidates for h10n8 vaccine and chikungunya vaccine which are not being progressed any further pending government or other agency funding of these development candidates the cmv vaccine mrna1647 is the most advanced with an ongoing phase 2 trial among our prophylactic vaccines we have generated clinical safety and tolerability data in more than 1000 subjects in addition we have observed the ability in clinical trials to elicit neutralizing antibodies to viral antigens from six  prophylactic vaccine programs to date our two influenza vaccines the rsv vaccine being developed in collaboration with merck the chikungunya vaccine being developed in collaboration with darpa our hmpvpiv3 vaccine and our cmv vaccine both the preclinical models and immune responses in humans showed increased antibody levels to pathogenic viral antigens 

we have demonstrated the ability to manufacture clinical supplies for our core modality of prophylactic vaccines in less than 30 days 

the mrna1273 program is to develop a vaccine against sarscov2 clinical supply for this mrna vaccine was designed and manufactured in 25 days 

we have generated safety tolerability and pharmacology data in the clinic for the lead program in our core modality of systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics 

we have demonstrated the ability of cells preclinically to make and secrete antibodies and soluble modulating factors that exert their pharmacologic activity by binding to targets and in some cases having a signaling effect we have five development candidates this this core modality we have generated safety and tolerability data for the antibody against chikungunya virus program mrna1944 in a phase 1 clinical trial there have been no serious aes in the study all aes were transient and resolved spontaneously without treatment we have clinically demonstrated doserelated increases in antibody levels produced which were at protective levels at all doses and we have demonstrated that these antibodies were functional by way of neutralizing activity against chikungunya virus for our relaxin program we have demonstrated an ability to make relaxin as a secreted and engineered protein which can impact heart failure in preclinical models 

we continue to describe safety and tolerability in clinical trials from hundreds of subjects for programs in our exploratory modalities 

the translation of preclinical safety and tolerability into the clinic is a key step for each of our programs and in totality supports the creation of a new class of medicines we continue to generate safety and tolerability data across ten  investigational medicines in four  different exploratory modalities 

we have demonstrated pharmacologic effect in the clinic for certain of our exploratory modalities through immunological responses 

for pcv mrna4157 which is the most advanced program in clinical development within the cancer vaccines modality we have observed antigen specific t cell responses in some patients in the ongoing clinical trial for ox40l mrna2416 in the intratumoral immunooncology modality we have observed early indications of the ability to impact the tumor microenvironment from tumor regression in injected lesions and an adjacent uninjected lesion 

we have demonstrated the ability of our intratumoral immunooncology programs to transform immunologically cold tumor microenvironments in preclinical studies for our ox40l triplet ox40lil23il36γ  and il12 programs these responses include longterm t cell responses that eliminate tumors in animal models and makes them able to combat a second tumor challenge indicating immunological memory we also have preclinical evidence of immunological responses for programs in our cancer vaccines modality including personalized cancer vaccines and kras vaccine 

we have demonstrated pharmacologic effect for certain of our exploratory modalities through enzymedriven changes in metabolic phenotypes 

we have tested our ability to impact metabolic phenotypes via the expression of over 24 different types of proteins we have also progressed four development candidates methylmalonic acidemia or mma propionic acidemia or pa phenylketonuria or pku and fabry disease through early preclinical development efforts we have demonstrated the ability of our mrna development candidates to drive metabolic change in animal models for mma pa pku and fabry disease 

we have produced a diverse set of proteins across both core and exploratory modalities 

our scientists in conjunction with scientists from merck and astrazeneca and other strategic collaborators have tested over 12000 unique mrna sequences in  in vitro  and  in vivo  preclinical studies this includes over 500  in   vivo  preclinical studies that were designed to show evidence of pharmacologic effect or the production of the desired protein these studies included the following types of proteins 

 

fifteen  firstinhuman trials since december 2015 and clinical material supply 

we invest in capabilities and infrastructure that enable us to execute at scale we first dosed a subject in a clinical trial in december 2015 we or our strategic collaborators have achieved firstinhuman for fifteen  different mrna investigational medicines eleven  of those programs were run and sponsored by us 

each firstinhuman or fih trial involved successful completion of one or more indenabling glp toxicology studies successful technical development scaleup and cgmp manufacture of adequate quantities of mrna drug product ind or cta regulatory filings and interactions with health authorities and successful clinical operations startup activities we or our strategic collaborators have run clinical trials in the united states europe and australia 

conclusion 

we believe that this body of preclinical and clinical data are indicative of our significant progress and provides a strong foundation for our ongoing mission to create a new class of medicines for patients 

program descriptions 

using our platform we have found solutions to many scientific and technical challenges in order to develop the desirable features of our potential mrna medicines for different applications a “modality” refers to a group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes 

each of our modalities is designed to overcome the challenges of delivering the right amount of mrna to the right tissue at the right times across a variety of applications in advancing our platform technologies and identifying new product features for novel mrna medicines we may designate additional modalities 

we started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality as we believed there would be lower technical hurdles for vaccines compared to therapeutics early formulations of mrna tended to stimulate the immune system which is a desired feature for a vaccine but not therapeutics in addition antigens for many viruses tend to be wellcharacterized and of lower biology risk also dosing regimens for vaccines can require as few as one or two administrations 

i program descriptions in our prophylactic vaccines modality 

we designed our prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent or control infectious diseases since we nominated our first program in late 2014 this modality has grown to currently include nine active programs all of which are vaccines against viruses the goal of any vaccine is to safely preexpose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen called an antigen so that the immune system is prepared to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future and prevent infection or disease 

within this modality our portfolio includes programs for both commercial and global health uses we have strategic alliances with merck on select commercial vaccines and with the biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda the defense advanced research projects agency or darpa the national institutes of health or nih as well as the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations or cepi on global health vaccine programs 

our global public health portfolio is focused on epidemic and pandemic diseases in which funding has been sought from government and nonprofit organizations given current funding and priorities the influenza h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 are being deprioritized at this time and removed from the active pipeline contingent upon future funding discussions on funding the influenza h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 through approval are ongoing 

our prophylactic vaccine pipeline is shown below 

opportunity 

vaccines to prevent infectious diseases are one of the great innovations of modern medicine in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322 million americans from falling ill 21 million hospitalizations 732000 deaths 295 billion of direct costs and 13 trillion in social costs the commercial opportunity for vaccines is significant with more than 35 billion in annual worldwide sales including 16 different vaccine products each generating more than 500 million in annual worldwide sales in 2017 

our approach 

our vaccine research approach starts by identifying the antigens most likely to induce a protective immune response against a specific infectious disease we test one or more antigens  in vivo  in multiple animal species the immune response can be measured in multiple ways including 

 clinical correlates of protection are levels of immune response that when achieved in response to vaccination are associated with protection against infection or disease influenza for instance has an established correlate of protection based on the serum hemagglutination inhibition or hai assay hai titers of 40 or above are associated with 50 to 70 protection against influenza however such correlates are generally only available for approved vaccines as a result new vaccines generally but not always have to demonstrate efficacy against clinical disease before being approved our first two programs in this modality are h10n8 and h7n9 vaccines for an established antigen with hai clinical correlates 

typically subjects require only a limited number of administrations of a vaccine to confer longlasting protection many of our mrna vaccines are developed to be administered in two doses one to prime the immune response and the second to boost it in cases where populations have been exposed to the virus previously such as with many respiratory viruses a subject might be administered a single dose of an mrna vaccine 

we believe that our potential mrna vaccines will have a more standardized manufacturing process compared to traditional vaccines that would provide considerable advantages current approaches include attenuation and replication of live viruses and cellculture methods to produce recombinant antigens these approaches require considerable customization compared to the standardized process of producing mrna vaccines 

we believe the inherent characteristics of mrna coupled with our strategy to execute at scale will allow us to bring potential mrna vaccines to the clinic in a relatively short period of time we have chosen to be methodical for our early programs to understand the technology risks within the modality if needed as in the case of a pandemic we could potentially exploit the scalability of mrna medicines and our infrastructure to rapidly advance a potential mrna vaccine to the clinic 

we believe that the positive safety and immunogenicity data obtained from six separate phase 1 clinical trials with our prophylactic vaccines including the most recent results with our cmv vaccine candidate mrna1647 have provided support for a reduced risk profile with respect to key aspects of our approach and technology in infectious disease vaccines we believe the clinical data demonstrate that our proprietary vaccine technology is generally welltolerated and can elicit durable immune responses to viral antigens we have discussed the platform nature of our vaccine technology with fda including our body of nonclinical and chemistry manufacturing and controls cmc experience and they have provided specific guidance on how to leverage our body of nonclinical data generated using the vaccine platform potentially expediting preclinical development of our novel vaccines we have designated prophylactic vaccines as a core modality we also believe we have demonstrated the ability to leverage common technological and digital platforms and a flexible manufacturing infrastructure to advance a large portfolio quickly and in parallel therefore consistent with our portfolio strategy we are expanding our portfolio of vaccines against important infectious diseases in early 2020 we introduced three new development candidates in this modality mrna1345 for the prevention of pediatric respiratory disease caused by rsv mrna1189 for the prevention of ebv infection and associated diseases and mrna1273 for the prevention of disease caused by sarscov2 each of these programs is described in detail below along with the other programs in this core modality 

prophylactic vaccines modality commercial programs 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 and mrna1172 summary 

mrna1777 rsv vaccine program completed dosing in a phase 1 clinical trial our strategic collaborator merck has initiated phase 1 clinical trial with mrna1172 which has been shown to have enhanced potency in preclinical studies 

respiratory syncytial virus or rsv is one of the most common causes of respiratory disease in infants and the elderly more than 86000 children and about 177000 older adults are hospitalized due to rsv associated respiratory infections each year in the united states to date no effective vaccine to prevent rsv has been approved and the only approved prophylaxis treatment is limited to the monoclonal antibody palivizumab marketed as synagis in the united states for pediatric patients at high risk for rsv infection in collaboration with merck we designed mrna1777 to encode a membraneanchored version of stabilized prefusion f protein the main target of potently neutralizing and protective antibodies this vaccine is administered as a single dose with no boost we conducted the phase 1 trial for mrna1777 in australia mrna1172 or v172 has been shown to have enhanced potency in preclinical studies compared to mrna1777 therefore further development on mrna1777 has been paused and merck has initiated a phase 1 trial in the united states for mrna1172 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 and mrna1172 disease overview 

rsv impacts young children and older adults and no approved vaccine exists today 

rsv causes upper and lower respiratory tract illness worldwide and is transmitted primarily via aerosolized droplets from an infected person or via contamination of environmental surfaces with infectious secretions following introduction of rsv into the nose or upper respiratory tract the virus replicates primarily in the ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium upper respiratory symptoms typically begin within several days of exposure in healthy adults the infection may remain confined to the upper respiratory tract however in those with compromised immune systems such as premature infants the elderly or individuals with underlying respiratory disease lower respiratory tract infections commonly occur and may manifest as wheezing bronchiolitis pneumonia hospitalization or even death infections with rsv follow a seasonal pattern occurring primarily in the northern hemisphere between the months of november and april and in the southern hemisphere primarily between march and october 

more than 86000 children are hospitalized due to rsv infection each year in the united states about 177000 older adults are hospitalized each year in the united states due to rsvassociated respiratory infections with approximately 14000 deaths as a result rsv infection is common in adults over the age of 60 years occurring in an average of 55 of older adults every season and resulting in physician’s visits for 17 of infected older adults the cost of rsv disease to society can be considerable 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 and mrna1172 our product concept 

prevent rsv infections with an improved rsv antigen using a single vaccine dose 

our rsv investigational medicine mrna1777 includes an mrna encoding an engineered form of the rsv fusion f glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion conformation in an lnp the f protein is present as a homotrimer on the surface of rsv the prefusion conformation of the f protein interacts with a host cell membrane and the conformational change from prefusion to postfusion drives virus fusion with a host cell the majority of rsvspecific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent people are directed to epitopes present only on the prefusion conformation of the f protein the prefusion state of the f protein elicits a superior neutralizing antibody response compared to the postfusion state in animal studies conducted by others a schematic of the prefusion f protein on the surface of a host cell with sites recognized by neutralizing antibodies is depicted in the figure below the inset on the left of the figure shows the intended design of the mrna formulated in lnp and the inset on the right shows the intended prefusion f protein on the surface of the cell we believe that neutralizing antibodies elicited by mrna1777 may lead to an efficacious rsv vaccine 

mrna1172 includes an mrna encoding for an engineered form of the rsv f glycoprotein in a merck proprietary lnp 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 and mrna1172 preclinical information 

mrna vaccines encoding different versions of the prefusion f protein have been evaluated in mice cotton rats and african green monkeys or agm these studies demonstrate that mrna vaccines encoding the prefusion f protein induce robust neutralizing antibody titers in preclinical species tested do not lead to vaccineenhanced respiratory disease evaluated in cotton rats and are protective against rsv challenge evaluated in cotton rats and agm the data for a study in agm are shown in the figure below in this study one group of agm 4 per group was vaccinated intramuscularly with vaccine a second group was infected with 55 log 10  plaque forming units or pfu of rsv strain a2 intranasally as a positive control and a third group received no vaccine as a negative control each on weeks 0 4 and 8 serum neutralizing antibody titers or sn titers were measured on the indicated weeks and are shown in panel a all animals were challenged intranasally and intratracheally on study week 10 on multiple time points after the challenge virus present in bronchoalveolar lavage or bal fluid was quantified by plaque assay as shown in panel b in this study we observed an increase in serum neutralizing titers with each vaccine dose the animals that received mrna1777 showed complete protection no virus detected in lungs similar to the control group immunized with rsv a2 these results are shown in the figures below

rsv vaccine mrna1777  mrna1172 clinical data 

the phase 1 trial for mrna1777 in australia generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity and has been completed further development of mrna1777 has been paused pending data from the ongoing phase 1 trial for mrna1172 sponsored by merck 

the phase 1 trial for rsv vaccine has met its objectives of assessing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1777 versus placebo including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for rsv vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed a humoral immune response as measured by neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a for dose levels one two and three of mrna1777 

the mrna1777 phase 1 study is a randomized partially doubleblind placebocontrolled doseescalation firstinhuman study to describe the safety tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy adult subjects in australia we are the sponsor for this trial the study evaluated three dose levels in healthy younger adults and 4 dose levels in healthy older adults all subjects were given a single intramuscular injection the key objectives of the study included 

 the key endpoints for the study included safety and tolerability of mrna1777 

the study was conducted in two parts part a evaluated healthy younger subjects ages   18 and   49 years and part b evaluated healthy older subjects ages   60 and   79 years there were four dose levels where the highest dose or dose four was twelve times the lowest dose or dose one and dose three the second highest dose was eight times the lowest dose in part a dose levels one two and three were evaluated the safety data from the sentinel safety group for each dose level was reviewed before permitting enrollment of the expansion group within that dose level cohort the safety data of each expansion group was reviewed before permitting dose escalationenrollment of the sentinel safety group at the next dose level in part b all four dose levels were evaluated the first sentinel dose cohort was triggered after review of the first sentinel dose level cohort in part a the safety data from the sentinel safety group for each dose level cohort was reviewed before permitting enrollment of the expansion group within that dose level cohort the safety data of each expansion group was reviewed before permitting dose escalationenrollment of the sentinel safety group at the next dose level part b includes the highest dose level dose four which was enrolled after review of the available safety and immunogenicity data of the preceding part b dose level cohorts expansion groups in part a and b were both randomized 31 mrna1777 placebo 

this 200subject study has been completed as of april 9 2018 we have the majority of data through three months 90 days postvaccination for younger subjects in dose levels one and two and for older subjects in doses one two and three based on the interim data as of april 2018 dose levels one two and three of mrna1777 were observed to elicit a humoral immune response as measured by neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a neutralizing antibody titers against rsv b dose level three only dose levels one and two have yet to be assayed absolute serum antibody titers to rsv prefusion f protein and rsv postfusion f protein and competing antibody titers to rsv prefusion f protein in a dosedependent manner up to dose level two in both younger and older subjects the immune response measured by neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a in older adults that received dose level three of mrna1777 was not higher than that of the subjects that received dose level two we have observed an increase in neutralizing antibody titers relative to placebo in younger adult subjects in panel a and older adult subjects in panel b who received our rsv vaccine as shown in the figure below in the figure geometric mean titer and 95 confidence interval are depicted by time for neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a for older and younger subjects at day ninety between 10 and 19 healthy younger subjects and between 11 and 27 healthy older subjects were tested at each dose level

in addition based on interim data as of april 2018 we observed an increase in t cell response relative to baseline at day 15 and day 60 in both healthy younger and healthy older adult subjects vaccinated with doses two and three of mrna1777 

based on interim safety data as of april 9 2018 mrna1777 was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities at dose levels one two and three in both the younger and older adults as of september 2018 the highest dose level which was evaluated in older subjects only dose level four was not as well tolerated as the lower dose levels however across all treatment arms there were no treatmentrelated serious adverse events or saes treatment emergent adverse events or teaes leading to withdrawals adverse events or aes of special interest or new onset of chronic illnesses or autoimmune disorders in either of the age cohorts there were no patterns in clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 

as of september 19 2018 we have observed 15 saes in nine subjects all of which were deemed unrelated to study product these saes occurred approximately one to ten months from receipt of study product and included aortic aneurysm repair paralytic ileus spinal decompression death from preexisting cardiomyopathy hernia transient ischemic attack peripheral vascular disorder vasovagal syncope diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer anterior cruciate ligament tear left knee tendon tear right knee tendon tear left patella dislocation right patella dislocation and bilateral patella tendon repair 

based on the interim safety tolerability and immunogenicity data in collaboration with merck we have opted to pause further development of mrna1777 merck is conducting a phase 1 trial with mrna1172 in the united states 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 summary 

our cmv program targets congenital cmv infections to reduce or prevent birth defects 

congenital cytomegalovirus or cmv infection is the leading cause of birth defects in the united states despite several attempts to date there is no vaccine approved to prevent congenital transmission of cmv we believe that in addition to the glycoprotein b or gb protein antigen a successful cmv vaccine would need to include the pentamer a 5protein membranebound antigen complex required for epithelial endothelial and myeloid cell infection by the virus a cmv vaccine containing the pentamer as a recombinant protein or a replication defective virus is complex to make and scale we used our platform to generate an mrna vaccine designed to make the pentamer in its natural membranebound conformation this investigational medicine is designed to prevent or control cmv infection and includes five mrnas encoding for the pentamer as well as one mrna encoding for cmv gb that has previously demonstrated partial clinical efficacy the phase 1 trial for mrna1647 has generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity as of september 2019 interim data from the phase 1 trial indicated that the vaccine was generally welltolerated there were no vaccinerelated serious adverse events the most common solicited local adverse reaction or ar was injection site pain the most common solicited systemic ars were headache fatigue myalgia and chills a doserelated increase in neutralizing antibody titers was observed in cmvseronegative participants at seven months one month after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels based on the interim data from the phase 1 trial we have initiated a phase 2 trial for mrna1647 in the united states 

cmv mrna1647 disease overview 

cmv is a major cause of birth defects with no approved vaccine 

human cmv is a common human pathogen and member of the herpes virus family seropositivity demonstrating prior exposure to virus increases with age and is approximately 4060 in women of childbearing potential in the united states however general awareness of cmv is not high less than 1020 of adults are aware of cmv and most healthy adults after initial primary cmv infection do not have symptoms however approximately 0607 of newborns are congenitally infected by cmv annually in industrialized countries congenital cmv results from infected mothers transmitting the virus to their unborn child and it is the leading cause of birth defects with approximately 25000 newborns per year in the united states infected birth defects occur in approximately 20 of infected babies and include permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities which can include hearing loss often permanent vision impairment varying degrees of learning disability decreased muscle strength and coordination and even death some studies report approximately onethird of infants with severe congenital disease will die within the first year of life and the survivors their caregivers and health systems bear significant longterm burdens 

there is currently no available vaccine for cmv and many previous attempts at developing a vaccine to reduce or prevent congenital transmission have been missing a key antigen the pentamer we believe the pentamer is critical for the infection of epithelial endothelial and myeloid cells by the virus we believe the pentamer was not included in certain prior recombinant protein vaccine attempts due to the complexity of producing it as a multiunit antigen complex prior vaccine studies demonstrated insufficient efficacy against cmv infection and limited durability of immune response a vaccine that leads to durable immunity in women of childbearing age would address a critical unmet need in the prevention of congenital cmv infection 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 our product concept 

we are developing a single vaccine with complex antigens to prevent or control infection 

our ability to generate a multiantigen vaccine enables us to combine a traditional target antigen gb with the pentamer in order to specifically focus the immune system on these important antigens we believe this gives us greater potential to produce neutralizing antibodies that can block cmv transmission from the mother to the fetus our approach to block transmission could either be 

 unlike a proteinbased or liveattenuated vaccine our mrna instructs cells to specifically make predetermined antigens with a structure that mimics the one presented to the immune system by the virus thus focusing the immune system on these important antigens 

mrna1647 comprises six mrnas that encode for these known hardtomake cmv antigens in a proprietary lnp 



 an illustration of our proposed approach for cmv is shown in the figure below 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 preclinical information 

we have published preclinical data for our cmv vaccine 

we have demonstrated that the pentamer and gb mrnas can elicit potent and durable antibody titers against the antigens in mice and nonhuman primates and have published these results in  vaccine  in 2018 in one study mice were immunized with the pentamer and gb mrnas encapsulated in our proprietary lnp serum samples were taken from the mice at specific timepoints post vaccination postvaccination neutralizing titers were measured by admixing serial dilutions of each sample with cmv virus incubating the mixture in a human primary epithelial cell culture and counting the number of infected cells we used cytogam an approved product for prevention of cmv in transplant patients as a control in our experiment cytogam is cytomegalovirus immune globulin from pooled plasma of cmv seropositive donors the table below shows the neutralization antibody titers in epithelial cells for escalating vaccine doses in mice demonstrating our ability to generate neutralizing antibodies we also observed that at the highest dose our mrna vaccine generated a response more than 75fold higher than cytogam at estimated clinical levels in addition we have also observed that the pentamer and gb mrnas can elicit strong t cell responses

cmv vaccine mrna1647 clinical data 

we have demonstrated safety and tolerability and generated immunogenicity data in our phase 1 trial based on the interim phase 1 data we have initiated a phase 2 trial with mrna1647 

we announced positive data from the second interim analysis of the phase 1 clinical trial of mrna1647 which has completed enrollment and is evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1647 in 181 healthy adult volunteers the clinical trial population includes those who are naïve to cmv infection “cmvseronegative” and those who had previously been infected by 

cmv “cmvseropositive” participants were randomized to receive either placebo or 30 90 180 or 300 µg of mrna1647 on a dosing schedule of 0 2 and 6 months this second planned interim analysis assessed safety and immunogenicity of the first three dose levels 30 90 and 180 µg at seven months one month after the third vaccination and the highest dose level 300 µg at three months one month after the second vaccination neutralizing antibody titers levels of circulating antibodies that block infection were assessed in two assays utilizing epithelial cells and fibroblasts which measure immune response to the pentamer and gb vaccine antigens respectively gb antigenspecific t cell responses after the second and third vaccinations were measured in a subset of cmvseronegative participants in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels utilizing an elispot assay pentamerspecific t cell assays remain in development vaccineinduced neutralizing antibody responses in the cmvseronegative group were compared to the baseline neutralizing antibody titers in the cmvseropositive group noting that prior maternal cmv infection is associated with an approximately 30fold lower risk of congenital cmv infection compared to the risk in the setting of maternal primary cmv infection 

in cmvseronegative participants at seven months one month after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

a doserelated increase in neutralizing antibody titers was observed in both epithelial cell and fibroblast assays 

after the third vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against epithelial cell infection were greater than 10 times higher in the 90 and 180 µg dose levels than cmvseropositive baseline titers at the 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

after the third vaccination neutralizing antibody titers against fibroblast infection were 13 to 14 times higher than cmvseropositive baseline titers at the 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

in cmvseropositive participants at seven months one month after the third vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels 

a doserelated increase in neutralizing antibody titers was observed in both epithelial cell and fibroblast assays 

the third vaccination boosted neutralizing antibody titers against epithelial cell infection to levels of 22fold to 40fold over baseline titers in all dose levels 

the third vaccination boosted neutralizing antibody titers against fibroblast infection to levels of approximately 4fold to 6fold over baseline titers in all dose levels 

participants receiving 300 µg of mrna1647 followed through three months one month after the second vaccination continued to show consistent dosedependent increases in neutralizing antibodies against epithelial cell infection and against fibroblast infection in both cmvseronegative and cmvseropositive groups safety and tolerability in participants receiving 300 µg of mrna1647 was comparable to that observed at the 180 µg dose level in a subset of cmvseronegative participants in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels gb antigenspecific t cell activation was observed at all dose levels after the second and third vaccinations 

a safety analysis indicated that the vaccine was generally welltolerated there were no vaccinerelated serious adverse events the most common solicited local adverse reaction or ar was injection site pain the most common solicited systemic ars were headache fatigue myalgia and chills fever was reported in 055 of cmvseronegative treatment groups and in 867 of cmvseropositive treatment groups in general solicited systemic ars occurred less frequently after the third vaccination compared to the second and were more common in the cmvseropositive cohorts compared to the cmvseronegative cohorts grade 3 solicited ars were more common in cmvseropositive participants and were fatigue 027 of a given dose cohort chills 027 of a given dose cohort and fever 033 of a given dose cohort as reported in the previous interim analysis there was a single grade 4 ar of an isolated lab finding of elevated partial thromboplastin time which was elevated at baseline grade 1 and selfresolved on the next lab test with no associated clinical findings safety and tolerability data at the 300 µg dose level were generally similar to that observed at the 180 µg dose level 

although the small sample size limits the conclusions that can be drawn from the data the findings from this interim analysis build on an earlier interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity data through one month after the second vaccination in the 30 90 and 180 µg dose levels a 12month interim analysis of safety and immunogenicity which will report safety and immunogenicity results through six months after the third vaccination is pending 

phase 2 start and phase 3 planning 

mrna1647 is the first mrna vaccine for an infectious disease to enter a phase 2 study the randomized observerblind placebocontrolled doseconfirmation phase 2 study will investigate the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1647 in approximately 252 healthy cmvseronegative and cmvseropositive adult volunteers in the us participants are randomized to receive either placebo or 50 100 or 150 µg mrna1647 on a dosing schedule of 0 2 and 6 months this phase 2 study is testing the intended phase 3 formulation which contains the same lipid nanoparticle “lnp” used in the phase 1 study the first interim analysis will evaluate safety and immunogenicity at three months one month after the second vaccination and is intended to inform phase 3 dose selection 

we are actively preparing for a global randomized observerblind placebocontrolled phase 3 pivotal study to evaluate the efficacy of mrna1647 against primary cmv infection in women of childbearing age we have solicited and received type c meeting feedback 

from the us food and drug administration “fda” on the preliminary design of the pivotal trial we believe this can be achieved with a trial with no more than 8000 participants and feasibility assessments of study sites has already begun across north america and europe the pivotal trial design will be finalized after discussion with the fda and other global health authorities manufacturing and planning are already underway for the pivotal phase 3 study which we expect to start in 2021 additional lottolot consistency and adolescent bridging clinical trials are being planned 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 summary 

we are developing a vaccine to address two viruses that are leading causes of respiratory infection 

human metapneumovirus or hmpv and human parainfluenza virus 3 or piv3 are important causes of respiratory tract infections in children despite the substantial impact hmpv and piv3 have on human health attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to rsv to date no vaccine to prevent hmpv or piv3 infections has been approved our platform allows us to combine mrnas encoding antigens for the two pathogens in one combination vaccine enabling a single vaccine that could protect against both respiratory infections in our approach we utilize mrna sequences encoding for the membrane fusion f glycoproteins or f proteins for each of the viruses we have generated safety tolerability and immunogenicity data from the phase 1 trial for mrna1653 in the united states which has been completed based on this data we have a phase 1b trial for mrna1653 ongoing in the united states in healthy adults and children aged 1236 months 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 disease overview 

hmpv and piv3 have a substantial impact on human health yet have lagged in research and attention relative to rsv 

there is no approved vaccine for hmpv although this rna virus has been determined to be one of the more frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections hmpv has been detected in 4 to 15 of patients with acute respiratory infections hmpv causes disease primarily in young children but can also infect adults the elderly and immunocompromised individuals clinical signs of infection range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to lifethreatening severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia hmpv was discovered in 2001 and identified as a leading cause of respiratory infection 

there is no approved vaccine for piv3 although this rna virus is recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections in children infections from parainfluenza virus or piv account for up to 7 of acute respiratory infections among children younger than 5 years of the four piv types identified piv3 most frequently results in infections and leads to the more serious lower respiratory tract infections compared to the other three piv types though piv3 related infections were identified in the past awareness of their burden to patients and hospitals has risen over the past several years 

the majority of hmpv or piv3associated hospitalizations in children occur under the age of 2 years despite the substantial impact hmpv and piv3 have on human health attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to rsv awareness of hospitalizations due to hmpv or piv3 infections have risen and we believe that a single vaccine intended for active immunization of infants and toddler against both hmpv and piv3 would be valuable previous attempts at developing a vaccine have focused on only hmpv or piv alone with no known attempts at a combination vaccine 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 our product concept 

our approach is to develop a combination vaccine for all infants and toddlers 

mrna1653 is a single investigational vaccine consisting of two distinct mrna sequences that encode the membrane f proteins of hmpv and piv3 coformulated in our proprietary lnp as shown in the figure below 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 preclinical information 

our mrna vaccine is immunogenic in multiple species 

we have evaluated multiple combinations for hmpvpiv3 mrna vaccines encoding fulllength f proteins for hmpv and piv3 viruses in mice sprague dawley rats cotton rats and african green monkeys or agm each following intramuscular or im injection these studies demonstrate that mrna encoding for f proteins from these viruses induce robust neutralizing antibody titers in all species tested for example neutralizing antibody titers for mrna encoding for f proteins of hmpv and piv3 encapsulated in lnp in mice are shown in the figure below c57bl6 mice were immunized with 033 2 or 12 µg of formulated material intramuscularly on study days 1 and 29 neutralizing antibody titers were measured in serum collected on day 43 results are represented as geometric mean titers or gmt of seven mice per group in the figure below neutralizing antibody titers in mice after immunization with mrna for hmpv and piv3 in our proprietary lnp by hmpv left panel and piv3 right panel are depicted along with the lower limit of quantification or lloq of the assay 



neutralizing antibodies are thought to be important for protection against hmpv and piv3 the titer of neutralizing antibodies induced by natural infection from hmpv or piv3 can be used to benchmark the titers induced by our hmpvpiv3 vaccine in preclinical models and in our clinical trial we determined the geometric mean neutralizing antibody titer for 15 seropositive adult donors to be 3807 range 499 to 20751 for hmpv and 263 range 47 to   1024 for piv3 our hmpvpiv3 mrna vaccine induces a similar neutralizing antibody titer in mice after 2 vaccinations of the dose levels evaluated as shown in the figure above and we believe it has the potential to confer protection in humans 

we have demonstrated that our hmpv and piv3 mrna combination vaccine does not lead to vaccineenhanced respiratory disease evaluated in cotton rats and is protective against hmpv or piv3 viral challenge evaluated in cotton rats and agm 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 clinical data 

we have generated safety tolerability and immunogenicity data from a phase 1 trial in the united states which has been completed based on the data we have a phase 1b trial in healthy adults and children aged 1236 months ongoing in the united states 

the mrna1653 phase 1 study is a blinded randomized observerblind placebocontrolled dose ranging firstinhuman study to evaluate the safety and tolerability reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mrna1653 in healthy adult subjects in the united states the study evaluates four dose levels of mrna1653 25 75 150 and 300 µg administered intramuscularly at day one and month one with the onemonth immunization randomized to be mrna1653 or placebo in the dose selection phase of the study 

the key objectives of the study include evaluating 

 the key endpoints for the study include safety and tolerability of mrna1653 

the schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below in the doseescalation phase there was sequential enrollment into one of the four dose levels of mrna1653 or placebo advancement to the next dose level was permitted after an internal safety review in the doseescalation phase five subjects were randomly assigned in a 41 ratio to receive mrna1653 or placebo the safety monitoring committee or smc reviewed safety data after doseescalation enrollment was completed to permit enrollment into the doseselection phase at the three highest dose levels with acceptable safety profiles in addition the smc periodically reviewed safety data during the doseselection phase 

124 subjects were enrolled in the study and subjects received both doses based on an unblinded evaluation of safety data from the doseescalation phase by the smc the three highest dose levels 75 150 and 300 µg were evaluated in the doseselection phase the study has been completed 

interim data from the phase 1 trial showed that a single vaccination with mrna1653 boosted serum neutralization titers against hmpv and piv3 and that the magnitude of the boost was similar at all dose levels tested consistent with prior exposure to hmpv and piv3 all study participants had neutralizing antibodies against both viruses at baseline one month after a single mrna1653 vaccination the hmpv neutralization titers were approximately sixfold greater than baseline and piv3 neutralization titers were 

approximately threefold greater than baseline based on geometric mean ratios a second mrna1653 vaccination one month after the first vaccination did not further boost antibody titers in addition the interim data showed that hmpv and piv3 serum neutralizing antibody titers remained above baseline through seven months mrna1653 was found to be generally well tolerated no saes adverse events of special interest or adverse events leading to withdrawal were reported injection site pain was the most commonly reported ae and the most common grade 3 ae 

we are conducting a phase 1b trial to evaluate mrna1653 in healthy adults and children aged 1236 months the phase 1b trial is a randomized observerblinded placebocontrolled doseranging trial to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of mrna1653 in healthy adults 1849 years of age and three dose levels in children 1236 months of age with serologic evidence of prior hmpv and piv3 exposure as of february 12 2020 24 adults were randomized in the ratio 111 to receive two doses of 30 μg of mrna1653 150 μg of mrna1653 or placebo two months apart 

pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 summary 

we are developing a pediatric rsv vaccine which we intend to ultimately combine with mrna1653 our hmpvpiv3 vaccine to address a wide array of viral respiratory illness in young children 

rsv is one of the most common causes of respiratory disease in infants and children under the age of five together with human metapneumovirus “hmpv” and human parainfluenza virus 3 “piv3” the three viruses represent the majority of the causes of respiratory tract infections in children to date no vaccine to prevent any of these three infections has been approved our platform allows us to combine mrnas encoding multiple antigens in one vaccine utilizing mrna sequences encoding for the membrane fusion f glycoproteins “f proteins” for each of the viruses we believe we can develop a single vaccine that could protect against all three respiratory infections in young children we intend to develop mrna1345 independently in early clinical development and subsequently to evaluate its use in combination with mrna1653 

to date no effective vaccine to prevent rsv has been approved and the only approved prophylactic treatment is the monoclonal antibody “mab” palivizumab marketed as synagis in the united states for pediatric patients at high risk for rsv infection the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 is being developed for active immunization of young children to protect them from rsvassociated respiratory disease like our rsv development candidates in collaboration with merck mrna1777 and mrna1172 or merck v172 the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 encodes a membraneanchored version of the stabilized prefusion f protein the main target of potently neutralizing and protective antibodies mrna1345 was engineered for increased expression and immunogenicity relative to mrna1777 and the mrna and protein sequence of mrna1345 are distinctive from both mrna1777 and mrna1172 or merck v172 the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 is formulated in our proprietary lnp and is being developed solely by us under the terms of our collaboration with merck we retain the right to commercialize certain mrna vaccines for the prevention of rsv infection in populations of up to 12 years of age when in combination with our hmpv and piv3 vaccine mrna1653 

pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 disease overview 

rsv is the leading cause of unaddressed severe lower respiratory tract disease and hospitalization in infants and young children worldwide 

rsv is a common cause of respiratory tract illness with most children infected at least once by two years of age the virus is transmitted primarily via contamination of environmental surfaces with infectious secretions and symptoms typically begin within several days of exposure the illness may manifest as wheezing bronchiolitis pneumonia hospitalization or even death in the united states it is estimated that over two million children younger than five years of age receive medical attention and more than 86000 are hospitalized due to rsv infection annually globally it is estimated that rsv is responsible for over approximately 33 million episodes of acute lowerrespiratory tract infection 32 million hospitalizations and as many as 118000 deaths per year in children younger than five years of age infections with rsv follow a seasonal pattern occurring primarily in the northern hemisphere between the months of november and april and primarily in the southern hemisphere between the months of march and october 

  

pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 our product concept 

prevent rsv disease in young children with an improved rsv antigen and our proprietary lnp formulation in the context of a combination vaccine that prevents other viral respiratory illnesses 

the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 encodes an engineered form of the rsv f proteins stabilized in the prefusion conformation and is formulated in our proprietary lnp the f protein is present as a homotrimer on the surface of rsv the prefusion conformation of the f protein interacts with a host cell membrane and the conformational change from prefusion to postfusion drives virus fusion with a host cell the majority of rsvspecific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent people are directed to epitopes present only on the prefusion conformation of the f protein the prefusion state of the f protein elicits a superior neutralizing antibody response compared to the postfusion state in animal studies conducted by others a schematic of the prefusion f protein on the surface of a host 

cell with sites recognized by neutralizing antibodies is depicted in the figure below the inset on the left of the figure shows the intended design of the mrna formulated in our proprietary lnp the same lnp formulation as mrna1653 and the inset on the right shows the intended prefusion f protein on the surface of the cell we believe that neutralizing antibodies elicited by mrna1345 may lead to an efficacious rsv vaccine in young children 

pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 preclinical information 

we evaluated expression and conformation of the f protein by treating cultured cells with mrna from mrna1345 and measuring f protein on the cell surface using a prefusion conformationindicating mab called am14 the figure below shows that prefusion f protein is detected on cells treated with mrna1345 and at a greater level than cells treated with mrna1777 

  

rsvf expression by cultured cells treated with mrna from mrna1345 or mrna1777 

we have demonstrated that the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 induces robust rsv neutralizing antibody titers in mice for example the left panel below shows the results of a study in which mice were immunized with different dose levels of mrna1345 intramuscularly on study days 1 and 21 and rsv neutralizing antibody titers were measured in serum collected on day 33 when compared to the results of a similar mouse study conducted with mrna from mrna1777 formulated in the same proprietary lnp as mrna1345 the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 was shown to be significantly more immunogenic we believe we can leverage 

our body of nonclinical clinical and cmc experience from our vaccine portfolio to expedite preclinical development of our pediatric rsv mrna1345 vaccine 

serum neutralizing titers in mice for mrna1345 and for mrna1777 mrna formulated in our same proprietary lnp 

                   

clinical trials of a formalininactivated rsv vaccine conducted in the 1960s resulted in higher rates of severe rsv disease in vaccinated infants than in control infants a finding referred to as vaccine enhanced respiratory disease “erd” it is thought that nucleic acidbased vaccines including mrna present a lower risk of erd because of their biologic similarities with live virus given that the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 is designed to enable intracellular production of prefusion f protein by a person’s own cells we believe that it likely recapitulates the antigenic presentation and immune cell stimulation as seen with natural infection further the mrna1777 rsv vaccine did not predispose for erd in a cotton rat rsv model to provide further confirmation that the pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 does not present a risk for erd additional preclinical studies will be conducted prior to clinical development of mrna1345 in rsv seronegative children or infants 

pediatric rsv vaccine mrna1345 clinical plan 

we plan to conduct a phase 1 doseranging safety and immunogenicity trial for mrna1345 in healthy adults and proceed to rsvseropositive children after a review of the adult data following the assessment of the results of this phase 1 study and potential future doseranging studies in younger rsvseronegative children we plan to evaluate the timeline for the combination of mrna1345 with mrna1653 our hmpvpiv3 vaccine for further development as a combination rsvhmpvpiv3 vaccine 

epsteinbarr virus vaccine mrna1189 summary 

our ebv vaccine seeks to prevent the development of infectious mononucleosis and ebv infection 

ebv a member of the herpesvirus family that includes cmv infects approximately 90 of people by adulthood with primary infection typically occurring during childhood and late adolescence approximately 50 and 89 seropositivity respectively in the us ebv is the major cause of infectious mononucleosis “im” in the us accounting for over 90 of the approximately 12 million cases of im in the us each year im can debilitate patients for weeks to months and in some cases can lead to hospitalization and splenic rupture ebv infection is associated with the development and progression of certain lymphoproliferative disorders cancers and autoimmune diseases in particular ebv infection and im are associated with increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis “ms” an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system there is no approved vaccine or effective treatment for ebv similar to cmv ebv has lytic and latent stages in its lifecycle and contains on its surface envelope multiple glycoproteins and glycoprotein complexes gp350 ghgl ghglgp42 and gb that mediate virus entry and infection in different cell types ebv gp350 mediates attachment to b cells through binding to the complement receptor 2 “cr2” followed by binding of the viral ghglgp42 complex to human leukocyte antigen “hla” class ii infection of epithelial cells instead requires binding of ghgl to a 

different set of receptors for both b cell and epithelial cell entry binding of an ebv ghgl complex to a cellspecific receptor leads to activation of gb which in turn facilitates viruscellmembrane fusion and infection ghgl and gb comprise the core viralfusion machinery conserved across all herpesviruses 

similar to our cmv vaccine mrna1647 product concept we used our platform to generate an mrna vaccine containing five mrnas encoding for gp350 gb gh gl and gp42 which are expressed in their native membranebound conformation for recognition by the immune system we have observed preclinical immunogenicity in the form of high and durable levels of antigenspecific antibodies against both b cell and epithelial cell infection in mice and in nonhuman primates “nhps” we intend to conduct a phase 1 trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine to understand its potential to prevent primary infection and prevent im following ebv infection in seronegative adults 

epsteinbarr virus disease overview 

ebv is the major cause approximately 90 of im and has been associated with the development of a range of malignancies and autoimmune disorders 

ebv is a common herpesvirus that is spread through bodily fluids most commonly saliva and is contracted primarily by young children and adolescents adolescents and young adults seroconvert at high rates particularly in collegeaged populations approximately 1025 per year resulting a seroprevalence of approximately 90 by the age of 20 after primary infection the virus establishes latency and persists in that state for life in most infected individuals the virus can reactivate intermittently over time even in immunocompetent hosts the virus usually infects resting b cells in the oropharynx or epithelial cells which line the mucosal surfaces of the body and in turn infect b cells b cells disseminate systemically and act as a reservoir for latent virus primary infection can cause im in 35 to 75 of instances depending on age and is characterized by symptoms requiring physician visits including sore throat lymph node swelling fever body aches and fatigue often resulting in months of missed work and school for patients and caregivers 

there is currently no approved vaccine against ebv but the potential of gp350 alone to reduce the rate of im has already been clinically demonstrated an experimental vaccine developed by others consisting of adjuvanted recombinant gp350 protein led to a reduction in the incidence of im in 78 of the participants in a phase 2 study of 181 healthy volunteers between the ages of 1625 however there was no significant difference between groups in protection against asymptomatic ebv infection we believe that the addition of ghgl and gb has the potential to provide protection against epithelial cell infection we believe the immune response against gp350 ghgl or gb has the potential to provide b cell protection which may be further enhanced by the inclusion of gp42 by preventing infection in epithelial cells and b cells this mrna vaccine has the potential not only to significantly reduce the rate of im but also to prevent ebv infection 

ebv infection is associated with increased risk of developing certain cancers and multiple sclerosis in western industrialized countries ebv is implicated in the development of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder conditions as well as multiple cancers including hodgkin’s lymphoma additionally in those seropositive for ebv development of infectious mononucleosis is associated with a greater than 2fold increased relative lifetime risk of developing multiple sclerosis in east asia ebv is associated with 8099 of nasopharyngeal carcinomas that arise in africa ebv is implicated in the development of approximately 95 of cases of endemic burkitt’s lymphoma together approximately 15 of worldwide cancer deaths are attributable to ebvassociated malignancies 

  

ebv vaccine mrna1189 our product concept 

we are developing a vaccine with multiple antigens designed to prevent development of infectious mononucleosis and ebv infections 

similar to our cmv vaccine mrna1647 product concept we believe that an effective ebv vaccine must generate an immune response to antigens that are required for viral entry in most of the susceptible cell types we have thus designed our ebv vaccine mrna1189 to elicit an immune response to ebv envelope glycoproteins gp350 as well as gb gp42 and the ghgl complex which are required for infection of both epithelial and b cells mrna1189 contains five mrnas encoding the viral proteins gp350 gb gp42 gh and gl encapsulated in our proprietary lnps proteins translated from our mrna will be displayed on the cell surface in their native conformation stimulating the production of neutralizing antibodies by training the immune system to recognize and neutralize the machinery used to infect b and epithelial cells we believe that our vaccine has the potential to prevent ebv primary infection and therefore the development of im further in the longrun should our ebv vaccine be approved we may pursue postmarketing and population studies to potentially evaluate its impact on other ebvassociated diseases our ebv vaccine utilizes the same proprietary platform technology as our cmv vaccine mrna1647 which was generally welltolerated and demonstrated durable neutralizing antibody titers higher than those measured in cmvseropositive patients following up to three doses of mrna1647 in our phase 1 trial 

ebv vaccine mrna1189 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to induce antibodies against ebv antigens required for viral entry into b cells and epithelial cells 

naïve balbc mice were given two doses of a vaccine against ebv antigens in combination approximately four weeks apart antibody titers against viral proteins involved in epithelial cell entry ghgl and gb or b cell entry gp350 ghgl and gb were measured in peripheral blood at day 57 results shown here represent five animals per group and demonstrate high levels of antigenspecific immunoglobulin g “igg” as compared to negative controls 

day 57 postvaccination 

ebv vaccine mrna1189 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1189 in seronegative adults 

we intend to conduct a phase 1 trial to test the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine to understand its potential to prevent primary infection and prevent im following ebv infection in seronegative adults 

prophylactic vaccines global health programs 

our global health portfolio for prophylactic vaccines seeks to leverage our mrna technology to address epidemic and pandemic diseases we are currently working with strategic collaborators such as barda darpa and nih to fund and support our programs within this area the first programs in this portfolio h10n8 vaccine and h7n9 vaccine helped identify and overcome the technical challenges with mrna vaccines and could eventually address pandemics for these viruses we have also gone from mrna sequence to a firstinhuman trial for zika vaccine in twelve months as we continue to build infrastructure and capabilities in the research engine and early development engine we believe we can help address future pandemics rapidly given current funding and priorities the influenza h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 are being deprioritized at this time contingent upon future funding discussions on funding the company’s influenza h7n9 vaccine program through approval are ongoing 

through investment in our platform and manufacturing technology we have established the capability to design and manufacture small batches of cgmp vaccines within 60 days this has been clinically demonstrated by our personalized cancer vaccine “pcv” program mrna4157 for which we have demonstrated the ability to manufacture and release a “customdesigned” vaccine for an individual patient within 60 days of sequencing the patient’s tumor we believe that this capability can be applied to rapidly produce clinical supply of mrna vaccine candidates for early clinical studies in collaboration with the vaccine research center “vrc” and division of microbiology and infectious diseases “dmid” of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases “niaid” part of the national institutes of health “nih” as well as the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations “cepi” we are pursuing the rapid manufacture of a vaccine to address the current sarscov2 outbreak we have leveraged our learnings across our vaccines to design and manufacture clinical supplies for our sarscov2 vaccine in 25 days sarscov2 was first identified in wuhan china on january 7 2020 

sarscov2 vaccine mrna1273 summary 

in collaboration with the nih and cepi we are rapidly developing a vaccine to address the sarscov2 outbreak 

in collaboration with the nih and cepi we are applying our platform for rapid vaccine design and manufacture to produce a vaccine against sarscov2 virus in response to the currently emerging outbreak of sarscov2 sarscov2 is a novel coronavirus that has infected thousands of people since identification on january 7 2020 spreading to multiple continents in collaboration with the vrc we are developing an mrnabased vaccine designed to express the coronavirus spike s protein based on the genomic sequence of sarscov2 on january 13 2020 the nih and our infectious disease research team finalized the sequence for the sarscov2 vaccine and we mobilized toward clinical manufacture as of february 24 2020 the first clinical batch has been shipped to and received by the nih for use in their planned phase 1 clinical trial in the us 

sarscov2 disease overview 

sarscov2 is a novel coronavirus with demonstrated animaltohuman and humantohuman transmission that has spread rapidly from china to multiple continents 

coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can lead to respiratory illness including middle east respiratory syndrome “mers” and severe acute respiratory syndrome “sars” coronaviruses are transmitted between animals and people and can evolve into strains not previously identified in humans on january 7 2020 sarscov2 was identified as the cause of pneumonia cases in wuhan china and additional cases have been found in a growing number of countries 

estimates from the world health organization as of february 19 2020 indicate that there are approximately 75000 confirmed cases in at least 25 countries and over 2000 deaths worldwide the suspected number of infections is likely to be substantially higher it is important to note that there is not yet a good understanding of the rate of asymptomatic infection currently there are no approved vaccines specific to sarscov2 

sarscov2 vaccine mrna1273 our product concept 

we are developing a vaccine against the spike protein complex to prevent sarscov2  infection 

in collaboration with the vrc we have selected the viral spike protein as the antigen for our sarscov2 vaccine mrna1273 our vaccine includes mrna encoding the spike protein which we believe will form a homotrimeric complex on the cell surface as it does when expressed on the surface of coronavirus particles the spike protein complex is necessary for membrane fusion and host cell infection and has been the target of experimental vaccines against the coronaviruses responsible for mers and sars we are leveraging our manufacturing platform to respond rapidly to the ongoing public health crisis 

sarscov2 vaccine mrna1273 representative preclinical information regarding a related coronavirus mers 

we have demonstrated the ability to induce neutralizing antibodies that confer protection against viral challenge with a related coronavirus mers 

we have begun evaluating our sarscov2 vaccine construct in animal models with further testing of the clinical batch expected shortly in an existing collaboration with the vrc to develop a vaccine against mers we designed an mrnabased vaccine targeting the prefusionstabilized spike protein 

in preclinical studies to assess the immunogenicity of the potential vaccine against mers rabbits were dosed with either one or two doses of vaccine one dose plus a booster at day 21 and then challenged with mers virus at day 42 at day 46 mers viral load was measured in the throat and nose and via bronchoalveolar lavage “bal” we observed induction of neutralizing antibodies which were sufficient to affect an approximately 3log reduction in viral titers in the nose and approximately 4log reduction in viral titers detected from bal viral titers in the throat were reduced to the lower limit of detection 

  



                

h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 summary 

our h10n8 and h7n9 investigational vaccines demonstrate the potential of our platform to respond to an influenza pandemic 

influenza is one of the most variable and deadly infectious diseases ranging from 1200056000 deaths per year in the united states alone the antigens in circulating seasonal influenza strains change slightly which is called antigenic drift from one year to the next necessitating a change in the vaccine to match the new strains potential pandemic influenza strains can arise very quickly from substantial changes in antigens which is called antigenic shift and because preexisting immunity is nonexistent in some populations they can be pathogenic addressing a potential pandemic requires the ability to produce an effective vaccine rapidly we believe that our platform enables the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines as a proof of concept we developed vaccines for h10n8 and h7n9 avian influenza strains where there is a quantitative correlate for protection in humans hemagglutinin inhibition or hai titer of   140 we have observed tolerability and immunogenicity in phase 1 clinical trials for both mrna vaccines for h10n8 and h7n9 and have published preclinical and interim clinical data for h10n8 in  molecular therapy  in 2017 and phase 1 results for h10n8 and h7n9 in vaccine  in 2019 we do not intend to progress these programs through clinical development on our own we may advance these programs with government or other grant funding 

h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 disease overview 

traditional vaccines cannot respond easily to a new influenza pandemic 

influenza a is an rna virus with a genome packed into eight individual gene segments that code for at least eleven functional proteins needed for infection replication and evasion of host antiviral responses the two major glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virion are hemagglutinin or ha and neuraminidase or na both of which are crucial for infection ha mediates viral entry into host cells by binding to sialic acid containing receptors on the host cell surface and causing fusion of viral and host endosomal membranes na mediates enzymatic cleavage of the viral receptor at late stages of infection allowing for the release of progeny virions 

influenza a viruses infect a variety of species including birds pigs sea mammals and humans wild aquatic birds serve as the reservoir of influenza a viruses infecting avian and mammalian species although many of these viruses are nonpathogenic in birds and most do not infect humans in recent decades some avian influenza viruses such as h10n8 and h7n9 have crossed the species barrier to cause human disease 

there have been five epidemics of human infection due to h7n9 totaling over 1500 cases with mortality rates of 3447 to date there have been three reported cases of h10n8 of which two have been fatal for both h10n8 and h7n9 severe or fatal infections are characterized by rapid progression to respiratory failure within days of initial symptoms 

there are efforts ongoing to develop a h7n9 vaccine and a universal influenza vaccine that covers h10n8 however we believe the use of traditional methods to produce these vaccines can lead to several shortcomings in the vaccine these include 

 h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 our product concept 

our platform can bring mrna encoding for influenza ha antigen to clinical testing rapidly 

our h10n8 and h7n9 influenza vaccine programs are each based on the mrna sequence for the cell viral ha membrane protein in a legacy lnp mrna1440 encodes for the ha protein of the h10n8 strain and mrna1851 encodes for the ha protein of the h7n9 strain 

we believe that mrna technology offers several advantages to traditional approaches of producing these vaccines including 

 h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 preclinical information 

we have observed immunogenicity of our mrna h10n8 vaccine in multiple species 

the level of a vaccine’s protection against influenza infection is traditionally measured using the hai assay the european medicines agency or ema and us food and drug administration or fda have endorsed hai titers of   140 to indicate an antibody level considered to be 50 protective against infection this benchmark was based on data from inactivated vaccines and varies with age group and setting 

proofofconcept for the use of mrna vaccines encoding the ha protein from h10n8 has been demonstrated in murine studies after a single dose of h10n8 vaccine mice exhibited antibody production sufficient to achieve hai titers of   140 which is regarded as a quantitative correlate for protection from influenza supporting immunogenicity data in ferrets and cynomolgus monkeys for the h10n8 vaccine have also been published by us in  molecular therapy  in 2017 

we have also observed immunogenicity of our mrna h7n9 vaccine in multiple species 

proofofconcept for the use of mrna vaccines encoding the ha protein from h7n9 influenza a virus has been demonstrated in murine studies after vaccination with mrna vaccines mice exhibited antibody production sufficient to achieve ha inhibition titers of   140 additionally a single dose of h7n9 vaccine protected 100 of mice from a lethal challenge with h7n9 virus even 84 days after completion of immunization in a ferret study where h7n9 vaccine was administered intradermally a reduction in 

lung viral titers was observed when ferrets were challenged 7 days post immunization supporting immunogenicity data in cynomolgus monkeys have also been reported by us in  molecular therapy  in 2017 

h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 clinical data 

the phase 1 clinical trial for h10n8 in germany has been completed and we have generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity 

the results of the phase 1 trial for h10n8 vaccine were reported by us in vaccine in 2019 the trial met its objectives of describing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1440 vs placebo including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for h10n8 vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed 100 of the subjects demonstrating hemagglutinin inhibition or hai titer   140 at day 43 21 days postsecond vaccination for the 100 µg dose where hai   140 is regarded as a quantitative correlate for protection from influenza we believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding in this randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled doseranging study we evaluated safety and immunogenicity of im dose levels of 25 50 75 100 and 400 µg on a twodose vaccination schedule on day 1 and day 21 we also evaluated intradermal or id dose levels of 25 and 50 µg on a twodose vaccination schedule on day 1 and day 21 the study objectives were safety tolerability and immunogenicity by hai and microneutralization or mn assays 201 subjects were enrolled in this study of which 145 received im vaccination and 56 received id vaccination of the 145 subjects in the im vaccination group there were 30 30 24 23 and 3 subjects in the 25 50 75 100 and 400 µg dose level groups respectively thirtyfive subjects received the placebo the phase 1 trial was conducted with the name of the intervention listed as val506440 in accordance with our legacy naming convention we have since changed our naming convention and have adopted mrna1440 in place of val506440 

doses up to 100 µg administered im demonstrated immunogenicity in the phase 1 trial the 75 µg cohort was started later and we chose not to proceed with its completion because the safety tolerability and immunogenicity data generated supported further development of the 100 µg dose intradermal vaccination was associated with high rates of solicited adverse events or aes mainly injection site reactions and we elected to discontinue enrollment of the id cohorts

 the phase 1 clinical trial for h7n9 vaccine in the united states has ended and we have generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity 

the results of the phase 1 trial for h7n9 vaccine were reported by us in vaccine in 2019 the trial has met its objectives of assessing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1851 vs placebo including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for h7n9 vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed 96 of the subjects demonstrating hai titer   140 at day 43 21 days postsecond vaccination for the 25 µg dose where hai   140 is regarded as a quantitative measure for protection from influenza we believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding this randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled doseranging study evaluated intramuscular or im dose levels of 10 25 and 50 µg using two vaccination schedules day 1 day 22 and day 1 month 6 the objectives were safety tolerability and immunogenicity by hai and mn assays 156 subjects were enrolled in this study 30 subjects per dose cohort received two doses of 10 µg 25 µg and 50 µg at days 1 and 22 10 subjects per dose cohort received one dose of 10 25 and 50 µg at day one and a total of 9 of those subjects received a second dose at 6 months data not shown thirtysix subjects received placebo a total of 10 subjects withdrew from the study the phase 1 trial was conducted with the name of the intervention listed as val339851 in accordance with our legacy naming convention we have since changed our naming convention and have adopted mrna1851 in place of val339851

zika vaccine mrna1893 summary 

in collaboration with barda we have advanced a second generation zika vaccine candidate to phase 1 

zika is an infectious disease caused by the zika virus in which infection during pregnancy has been linked to severe brain damage in infants with congenital infection and guillainbarré syndrome in adults to date no vaccine to prevent zika infection has been approved in september 2016 we were awarded a contract with barda to be reimbursed up to approximately 1250 million for the development of a zika mrna vaccine in order to rapidly respond to a potential epidemic we developed a zika vaccine mrna1325 which went from mrna sequence design to firstinhuman clinical testing in twelve months in addition we also developed a second zika vaccine mrna1893 mrna1893 at 120 of the dose demonstrated better protection in nonhuman primates as compared to mrna1325 mrna1893 is in a phase 1 trial in the united states as of february 12 2020 we have enrolled 90 subjects in the phase 1 trial 

zika vaccine mrna1893 disease overview 

we faced a zika epidemic in 2015 for which there were no vaccines or treatments 

the zika virus is a single stranded rna virus of the flaviviridae family it was first isolated in a rhesus macaque in the zika forest uganda in 1947 and the first human case was documented in 1952 seroepidemiology data suggest that it is endemic to regions of africa and asia where the  aedes  mosquito vectors are found zika virus is predominantly spread by mosquitos from the  aedes  genus but it can also be transmitted congenitally sexually and through blood donation 

in 2007 a zika infection outbreak progressed across the pacific islands it arrived in brazil in 2015 and the epidemic spread across the americas this led to the world health organization or who declaring it a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 during the period there were tens of thousands of cases of microcephaly and congenital zika syndrome reported in infants and of resulting neurological sequelae such as guillainbarré syndrome reported in adults 

zika infection is usually asymptomatic or mild in adults leading to fever rash and conjunctivitis however infection of women during pregnancy can result in devastating microcephaly in newborns microcephaly is a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head and brain associated with lifelong neurodevelopmental delay seizures intellectual disability balance 

problems and dwarfism  short stature resulting in significant disability and requiring lifelong support to date over one million cases of zika have been officially reported in latin america since most of the cases are asymptomatic we believe the actual number of cases may be far higher international travel means that zika infection has the potential to take on global significance while the number of cases has declined in the past couple of years there is currently no treatment or vaccine available for the zika virus to prevent and respond to potential future epidemics 

currently there is no approved vaccine for zika designing and synthesizing conformationally correct protein antigen vaccines attenuated or vectored live viral vaccines or inactivated vaccines is time consuming and challenging these traditional vaccine approaches have therefore found it difficult to respond fast enough to the emerging zika epidemic 

zika vaccine mrna1893 our product concept 

we advanced a complex antigen to the clinic in twelve months and followed up with a next generation vaccine 

we believe our platform allows for rapid development of mrna vaccines with complex immunogenic antigens faster than traditional vaccines in order to rapidly deploy an mrna vaccine for zika we leveraged available sequences and legacy lnps to develop mrna1325 mrna1325 contains a sequence encoding for structural proteins in the zika virus the intended design is for translation of a polyprotein and processing inside the cell to make a secreted viruslike particle or vlp this process mimics the response of the cell after natural infection as shown in the figure below 

continued efforts at identifying different mrna sequences with improved immunogenicity led to mrna1893 a sequence distinct from mrna1325 that increases production of zika vlps and generates enhanced immunogenicity and protection in preclinical animal models compared to mrna1325 mrna1893 is also formulated in our proprietary lnp 

zika vaccine mrna1893 preclinical information 

we have observed and published our immunogenicity data for our zika vaccine 

the mrna sequences for mrna1325 and mrna1893 have been tested in mice and nonhuman primates or nhps we have published a subset of these data in the journal  cell  in 2017 the mrna sequence for mrna1893 produces equivalent immunogenicity and better protection compared to the sequence used in mrna1325 at 120 of the dose in nhps as shown in the figure below in this study mrna vaccine or placebo was administered intramuscularly in a twodose vaccination schedule 28 days apart with five animals included in each group nhps were challenged with zika virus 28 days postboost and viral titers were measured post challenge via quantitative pcr measurements were quantified in terms of focus forming units 

sequence for mrna1893 provided comparable protection to that of mrna1325 in nonhuman primate challenge study 

zika vaccine mrna1893 clinical data 

we are conducting a phase 1 trial for mrna1893 in the united states and we will not further develop mrna1325 

we are currently enrolling in a phase 1 randomized observerblind placebocontrolled doseranging study to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna1893 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age inclusive in endemic and nonendemic zika regions mrna1893 is administered intramuscularly in a twodose vaccination schedule 28 days apart at four dose levels 10 µg 30 µg 100 µg and 250 µg key objectives of the study include 

 

subjects were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion in an approximate 41 ratio to receive mrna1893 or placebo at one of four dose levels 10 µg 30 µg 100 µg and 250 µg with each subject receiving two vaccinations separated by 28 days twentyfive of the enrolled participants at each dose level will be flavivirus seronegative and five will be flavivirus seropositive 

as of february 12 2020 we have enrolled 90 subjects with 30 subjects each in the 10 µg 30 µg and 100 µg dose cohorts 

ii program descriptions in our cancer vaccines modality 

we designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens defined below this modality has two programs currently for neoantigen vaccines a personalized cancer vaccine or pcv program and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called kras both conducted in collaboration with merck the goal of a cancer vaccine is to safely expose the patient’s immune system to tumor related antigens known as neoantigens to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique to a patient as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from checkpoint inhibitors as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available therapies in addition treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms principally the local immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells which prevent either access to or recognition by t cells 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor t cell therapies have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens 

our approach 

we are developing mrnabased cancer vaccines to utilize the antitumor killing capacity of t cells to drive antitumor efficacy evidence of tumor killing by t cells in treating certain cancers has increased in the last decade with advances in immunotherapies the immune system’s antitumor response relies on t cells recognizing tumor cells as nonself and eradicating these “foreign” cells human leukocyte antigen or hla complexes are a diverse set of genes or alleles that present fragments of proteins from inside hla i or outside hla ii cells to the immune system a person’s hla type defines what hla alleles they express and can restrict what antigen may be presented to their immune system antigens presented in hla molecules are recognized by t cell receptors or tcrs present on the cell surface of cd4 and cd8 t cells these two main classes of t cells have distinct mechanisms to potentially attack tumor cells cd4 cells play an important role in activating other immune cells after recognition of antigens in hla ii molecules whereas cd8 cells can have direct cytotoxic cell killing capabilities upon recognition of antigens in hla i molecules both cell types have been demonstrated to have important roles in driving an effective antitumor immune response 

over the past three decades there have been many attempts to develop cancer vaccines few of which have been successful key reasons include 1 past attempts were directed against shared “self” nonmutated antigens 2 nearly all previous attempts utilize peptide fragments to try to mimic peptides displayed by hla i molecules this method may not have been able to mimic the natural processing and presentation of antigens by the immune system and therefore may not be recognized and 3 earlier work was done in the era prior to the benefit of checkpoint inhibitors 

we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular cancer in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program 

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 summary 

we are collaborating with merck to use the strength of our platform to develop cancer vaccines with multiple neoantigens unique to each patient also known as personalized cancer vaccines or pcvs 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells in a variety of cancer settings despite these advances many patients still have incomplete or no response to anticancer therapies one approach is to administer a cancer vaccine that encodes for peptides containing mutations found in their cancer ie to create a personalized cancer vaccine composed of neoantigens unique to a patient’s tumor previous attempts have demonstrated the ability of mrna and peptidebased platforms to drive immune responses toward patientspecific neoantigens preclinical studies have shown that the combination of cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors provides improved benefit over singleagent therapies our platform is positioned for bringing personalized cancer vaccines to patients with our proprietary  in silico  design of each patient’s neoantigenbased mrna vaccine to be coupled with our automated cellfree manufacturing processes and infrastructure based in our mtc facility in norwood ma as well as our digital infrastructure we believe these attributes coupled with our proprietary lnps help differentiate our approach from ongoing efforts at developing mrnabased cancer vaccines mrna4157 is administered either as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab marketed in the united states as keytruda this is in collaboration with merck as governed by a joint steering committee nci4650 is a personalized cancer vaccine being tested by the national cancer institute or nci as a monotherapy for patients with advanced metastatic cancers nci4650 differs from mrna4157 in its neoantigen selection process mrna4157 has a phase 1 trial ongoing in the united states and phase 2 trial ongoing in the united states and australia the nci4650 phase 1 trial in the united states was completed in november 2019 as of february 12 2020 15 patients with resected solid tumors melanoma colon and lung cancers received mrna4157 as adjuvant monotherapy after resection of their primary tumor an additional 56 patients with metastatic unresected solid tumors melanoma bladder lung colon prostate head and neck and endometrial cancers received at least one dose of mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab as of june 2019 we have detected antigen specific t cell responses in both the monotherapy arm and in combination with pembrolizumab we have also observed clinical activity in some patients receiving mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab we and our strategic collaborator merck have a phase 2 trial of adjuvant mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma ongoing 

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 our product concept 

rapid personalized current good manufacturing practice or cgmp manufacturing to bring personalized cancer vaccines to patients 

as tumors grow they acquire mutations some of which create new protein sequences or neoantigens that can be presented on hla molecules in the tumor and recognized as nonself by t cells these neoantigens can be shared as in mrna5671 or are completely unique to an individual patient’s tumor in addition to the neoantigens being unique and patient specific the presentation of those neoantigens is also dependent on a patient’s specific hla type identification of patientspecific hla type and tumor neoantigens through next generation sequencing paired with our proprietary  in silico  design of each patient’s mrna vaccine and rapid manufacturing for a specific patient allows us to rapidly deliver a completely unique and personalized medicine to patients 

we believe that antigenencoded mrna is an attractive technology platform for neoantigen vaccination for cancer patients for the following reasons 



our personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 consists of an mrna that encodes up to 34 neoantigens predicted to elicit both class i cd8 and class ii cd4 responses designed against each individual patient’s tumor mutations and specific to their hla type nci4650 includes both neoantigens known to be immunogenic as identified through  ex vivo  experimentation on the patient’s immune cells and neoantigens predicted by the nci bioinformatics algorithm for both mrna4157 and nci4650 the neoantigens are encoded in a single mrna sequence and therefore termed a neoantigen concatemer each patientspecific mrna4157 and nci4650 is formulated in our proprietary lnps designed for intramuscular injection an illustration of the intended design of mrna4157 and nci4650 is shown in the figure below 

each mrna4157 and nci4650 is produced using an integrated batch manufacturing process that is the same regardless of the sequence of the neoantigens to be produced the overall process involves five major steps that are highly integrated and intended to enable a robust chain of custody and chain of identity an overview of the system is provided in the figure below 

the process includes the following steps 



specifically for each patient the tumor sample and peripheral blood samples are collected and immediately sent for ngs analysis whole exome sequencing or wes data are generated from both the tumor and blood samples with the blood sample serving as the germline unmutated reference wes results from the blood sample are also to be used to determine the patient’s hlatype using an ngsbased approach the tumor transcriptome is determined by mrna sequencing or rnaseq the hla typing wes and rnaseq results for each patient are provided as inputs to our proprietary vaccine design algorithm which predicts which neoantigens could be the most immunogenic the mrna sequence is then manufactured using an automated workflow to enable a rapid turnaround time the final drug product is shipped to the clinical site for administration to the same patient that provided the original biopsy 

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 preclinical information 

we have utilized model antigens as surrogates for pcv to demonstrate the ability to elicit a robust t cell response with a single mrna 

we have completed preclinical studies to characterize the ability of an mrna vaccine to induce a robust and specific t cell response to multiple antigens specifically the ability of our mrna vaccines to elicit

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 clinical data 

our phase 1 trial for pcv is currently ongoing in the united states and our phase 2 trial for pcv is currently ongoing in the united states and australia 

the phase 1 trial is an openlabel multicenter study to assess the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna4157 alone in subjects with resected solid tumors and in combination with the cpi pembrolizumab marketed in the united states as keytruda in subjects with inoperable solid tumors the study is sponsored by us mrna4157 is administered by intramuscular injection on the first day of each 21day cycle and for a maximum of 9 doses mrna4157 is administered as monotherapy part a or in combination with pembrolizumab parts b c and d in the united states four mrna4157 dose levels of 004 mg 013 mg 039 mg and 1 mg will be explored in part a and part b through dose escalation the following cancers are being investigated nonsmall cell lung cancer subject to certain entry criteria small cell lung cancer melanoma bladder urothelial carcinoma human papillomavirusnegative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and a variety of solid malignancies 

the key objectives of the study include 



a schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below 

as of february 12 2020 15 patients with resected solid tumors melanoma colon and lung cancers received mrna4157 as adjuvant monotherapy after resection of their primary tumor an additional 56 patients with metastatic unresected solid tumors melanoma bladder lung colon prostate head and neck and endometrial cancers received at least one dose of mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab 

in our dose escalation of mrna4157 in part a monotherapy we have detected antigen specific t cell responses this is measured by restimulating unexpanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells with sets of peptides corresponding to neoantigens encoded by the patientspecific mrna4157 and is shown in the figure below individual data points indicate technical replicates 

antigenspecific t cell responses for one patient at the 013 mg dose level in part a of the phase 1 clinical trial for pcv vaccine mrna4157 

as of june 2019 mrna4157 was welltolerated at all dose levels studied with no doselimiting toxicities or grade 3 or 4 adverse events aes or saes reported when administered as a monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab the most common grade 2 adverse events were fatigue soreness at the injection site colitis and myalgias a cohort of patients at the top dose level 1 mg are undergoing apheresis and deeper characterization of immunogenicity responses data from one such patient as of june 2019 showed neoantigenspecific cd8 tcell responses were detected to 10 out of 18 class i neoantigens after the 4 th  dose of the vaccine compared to 018 at baseline clinical responses one complete response  five partial responses at doses ranging from 00410 mg were observed in 6 out of 20 patients receiving at least one dose of mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab the complete response occurred to pembrolizumab monotherapy before mrna4157 was administered of the five partial responses two were seen in patients previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor of the 13 patients who received adjuvant mrna4157 monotherapy all patients have completed a full course of vaccination per the study protocol eleven patients remained disease free up to 75 weeks on study 

nci4650 is in an investigatorinitiated singlearm openlabel trial involving up to 12patients with advanced metastatic disease sponsored by national cancer institute this trial has been completed as of november 2019 

we and our strategic collaborator merck are conducting a randomized phase 2 study to assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab improves relapsefree survival compared to pembrolizumab alone the study has a primary endpoint of relapse free survival with a primary analysis at 12 months and will be conducted with patients that have had complete resection of cutaneous melanoma but remain at high risk of recurrence as of february 12 2020 25 patients have been dosed with either mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab or pembrolizumab alone 

a schematic of the phase 2 trial is shown in the figure below 

kras vaccine mrna5671 summary 

in collaboration with merck we are developing a cancer vaccine mrna5671 with mrnas encoding for a concatemer of mutations in the kras oncogene protein 

although monotherapy checkpoint inhibitor treatment can provide significant benefit for some cancer patients many have incomplete or no response to therapy presenting a need for alternative therapies to stimulate antitumor immunological responses finding oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell epitopes has considerable therapeutic implications point mutations in the kras gene occur in about 22 of human cancers such as colorectal nonsmall cell lung and pancreatic cancers direct inhibition of kras has proven challenging and to date there are no successful krastargeted cancer therapies it has been reported that krasmutant neoantigens can be presented on certain human hlas therefore one approach is to immunize the body to naturally synthesize neoantigen peptides that contain common kras mutations for presentation to the immune system by mrna we have designed an mrna to generate and present kras neoantigens to the immune system from the four most common kras  mutations we transferred the ind to merck since merck is the sponsor of the phase 1 trial the phase 1 trial is being conducted by merck and is currently ongoing in the united states patients will either be dosed with mrna5671 as monotherapy or in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab 

kras vaccine mrna5671 our product concept 

our approach is to encode multiple mutations of kras in our mrna vaccine administered together with a checkpoint inhibitor 

oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell neoantigens have considerable potential therapeutic implications 1 driver mutations are subject to positive selection as they confer survival advantages for the tumor and 2 such neoantigens could be shared between patients enabling an easier approach to developing and manufacturing such therapeutic or curative interventions 

kras is a frequently mutated oncogene in epithelial cancers primarily lung colorectal cancer or crc and pancreatic cancers the four most prevalent kras mutations associated with these malignancies are g12d g12v g13d and g12c which constitute 80 to 90 of kras mutations kras has multiple downstream signaling pathways and although drugs have been developed to target individual effectors direct inhibition of kras could be more efficacious direct inhibition of kras has proven challenging as have past efforts at generating a cancer vaccine against kras these attempts have proven to be ineffective likely due to either the lack of concomitant administration of a checkpoint inhibitor or vaccines which have been only minimally immunogenic none of the historic attempts at a kras vaccine used mrna 

immune stimulators are often incorporated in vaccines to improve immune response to the antigens of interest stimulator of interferon gene or sting is a cytosolic nucleotide sensor known to trigger type 1 interferon responses and has been reported to promote antigen specific t cell responses sting has been reported to promote antitumor immunity and vaccines including sting agonists eg cyclic dinucleotides show overall improvement of immune responses to poorly immunogenic antigens merck has opted to advance mrna5671 without sting mrna and may choose to include sting mrna in further clinical development of this vaccine 

in order to drive t cell mediated antitumor responses our mrna vaccine includes an mrna encoding for a concatemer of sequences encoding the four most common kras mutations encapsulated in our proprietary lnp our mrna vaccine will be dosed either as monotherapy or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor an illustration of one approach for mrna5671 is shown in the figure below 

kras vaccine mrna5671 preclinical information 

we have observed the utility of kras mrna vaccine in vivo 

the immunogenicity of our kras vaccine is supported by several preclinical studies in which we observed that our mrna encoding for kras mutations can be made in cells and presented in transgenic mice with specific hla i alleles 

one of these models was a transgenic mouse model expressing a specific human hla this is shown in the figure below these transgenic mice were vaccinated with either mrna encoding a11positive control antigens control single mutant kras neoantigen or the concatemer of the four most common mutant kras neoantigens plus mrna encoding sting mrna was formulated in our proprietary lnp and delivered intramuscularly on day 1 and day 15 t cell responses were measured on day 22 by restimulating splenocytes with either medium or wild type or mutant kras peptides panel a—kras mutation 1 and panel b – kras mutation 2 robust and specific antigen specific cd8ifn γ t cell responses were detected in splenocytes after restimulation with kras mutation 1 peptide and kras mutation 2 peptide

iii program descriptions in our intratumoral immunooncology modality 

we designed our intratumoral immunooncology modality to treat or cure cancer by transforming the tumor microenvironment to drive anticancer t cell responses against tumors this modality currently has three programs our mrna technology within this modality allows for the combination of multiple therapeutics that can be directly injected into a tumor with the goal of activating the tumor microenvironment to kill cancer cells in the injected tumor as well as in distal tumors known as the abscopal effect intratumoral administration allows for localized effect of these therapeutics that could be toxic if administered systemically 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 there have been several advances in the treatment of cancer through immunemediated therapies in recent years however the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer remains poor especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement and are therefore termed immunologically “cold” we aim to activate the tumor microenvironment with our mrna therapeutics in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors 

our approach 

our intratumoral immunooncology modality is focused on driving robust specific anticancer t cell responses transforming cold tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment into one that is immunologically “hot” thereby resulting in a productive anticancer immune response our goal is to discover and develop locally administered or intratumoral immunemediated therapies to deliver mrna encoding for potent immunestimulatory proteins that can act at the site of the injected tumor reduce systemic toxicities and potentially create an “abscopal effect” where distal tumor sites are also impacted these may be combined with checkpoint inhibitors to boost the response all of the mrnas utilized in this modality are designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of microrna binding sites thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability 

earlier efforts by others on the utility of intratumoral immunemediated therapies have been established in murine models of cancer in many of our preclinical studies focusing on demonstrating bioactivity and efficacy in mice we have employed surrogate mrnas encoding murine homologs given that human proteins may not be sufficiently crossreactive in mice and that the use of human proteins in mice would be expected to elicit antiforeign protein immune responses 

ox40l mrna2416 summary 

our immunooncology approach to enhance specific t cell responses in the tumor microenvironment via expression of the membrane t cell costimulator ox40l by intratumoral injection of ox40l mrna 

there have been several recent advances in the treatment of cancer through activation of the immune system however many patients with advanced stages of cancer respond to few therapies and continue to face a poor outlook alternative strategies to activate an immunologic antitumor response while at the same time reducing systemic toxicities are required to this end we have developed an investigational mrna therapeutic coding for wildtype ox40 ligand or ox40l protein a membrane protein normally expressed on antigen presenting cells upon immune stimulation that augments an activated immune response mrna2416 encodes for wildtype ox40l which is a membrane protein a class of proteins that we believe cannot be manufactured for administration to tumor cells by recombinant technologies mrna2416 is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors following local intratumoral injection we are currently sponsoring a phase 12 trial that is ongoing in the united states we amended the protocol to add a phase 1 dose escalation cohort in combination with durvalumab followed by a phase 2 expansion cohort in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma as part of the current trial as we anticipate synergistic activity of mrna2416 in combination with durvalumab 

as of february 12 2020 41 patients were dosed with mrna2416 39 patients in monotherapy and 2 patients in combination with durvalumab as of october 22 2018 26 patients were evaluated for response with mrna2416 monotherapy and the best overall response was stable disease n6 two patients with ovarian cancer have demonstrated clinical observations of tumor shrinkage in injected andor uninjected lesions based on these clinical observations we have opted to expand the trial to a phase 2 expansion cohort in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma 

ox40l mrna2416 mechanistic overview 

ox40l is a t cell costimulator 

the generation of optimal t cell responses requires t cell receptor or tcr engagement by presented epitopes eg cancer antigens and a positive secondary signal achieved through costimulatory molecules like ox40 ox40 receptor also known as tnfrsf4 or cd134 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor or tnf receptor superfamily and is upregulated on activated immune effector cells upon tcr activation ox40 is endogenously stimulated via ox40l a homotrimeric membrane protein normally expressed on professional antigen presenting cells binding of ox40 by ox40l in the presence of a recognized antigen enhances the expansion of cd4 and cd8 t cells increases t cell effector function and enhances survival of experienced t cells for increased memory capacity prior clinical attempts of activating ox40 with agonist antibodies may have been hampered via antibody interactions with other cells we believe that introduction of ox40l in tumor sites via mrna may serve to boost t cell responses and we believe intratumoral administration of mrna encoding for ox40l may be an attractive method of enhancing anticancer immunity 

ox40l mrna2416 our product concept 

our approach is to deliver ox40l mrna in a lipid nanoparticle intratumorally to produce a membrane t cell costimulator 

our product consists of mrna coding for the human sequence of ox40l formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna2416 was designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of a microrna binding site thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability following intratumoral injection a specific antitumor immune response is expected to be induced via proliferation and migration of t cell clones with specificity for the cancer that may also result in systemic antitumor responses an illustration of our approach for this program is shown in the figure below an earlier concept of this development candidate included a legacy lnp however we observed sufficient toxicity findings in an indenabling glp toxicology study to abandon the legacy lnp toxicity findings were largely diminished when the development candidate was switched from a legacy lnp to our proprietary lnp 

ox40l mrna2416 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of cancer using our approach 

intratumoral administration of mouse ox40l mrna in our proprietary lnp resulted in production of ox40l protein in the tumor microenvironment and draining lymph node in mice the activity of mouse ox40l or mox40l was evaluated in syngeneic models including an h22 hepatocellular carcinoma model with this model h22 cancer cells were subcutaneously implanted on the flank of balbc mice following tumor growth mice were randomized into treatment groups and treated with weekly intratumoral injections of formulated mrna encoding mox40l or a negative control mrna repeated weekly intratumoral injections of mox40l mrna in a syngeneic h22 mouse model resulted in 50 of the mrnatreated mice with no measurable disease at the end of the study survival of mice treated with negative control mrna and mrna encoding murine ox40l are depicted in gray and red respectively in the figure below mice with subcutaneous h22 tumors were treated intratumorally with 75 µg of mrna formulated in lnps on days 8 16 and 24 post cancer cell implant 6 of 12 mice treated with mox40l mrna were complete responders with no detectable tumor burden at day 100 whereas negative control mrna formulated in lnps yielded no complete responders survival curves were plotted by considering any reason a mouse was removed from study including the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3  as a survival event 

we further demonstrated generation of anticancer immunological memory after ox40l mrna treatment as no tumor growth was observed in mice in the six initial complete responders that were reinjected with the same h22 cancer cells 

50 complete responders n12 with mouse ox40l mrna in h22 syngeneic mouse model study 

the potential ability of intratumoral ox40l mrna to yield benefit in a largely checkpoint inhibitor cpirefractory setting was tested in the mc38s colon carcinoma tumor mouse model in this study mice were treated with mrna 6 weekly intratumoral injection of 50 µg of mox40l mrna or negative control mrna or cpi antibody 5 twiceweekly intraperitoneal injections of 10 mgkg of an anti‑pdl1 antibody or isotype control antibody monotherapies or with a combination of mox40l mrna  antipd‑l1 shown below the combination of mox40l mrna  antipd‑l1 antibody resulted in complete tumor regression in 8 of 15 animals 53 crs whereas only 0 to 2 of 15 mice exhibited complete responses to active mox40l mrna or anti‑pd‑l1 monotherapies and negative controls 

we further demonstrated generation of anticancer immunological memory after ox40l mrna  αpdl1 treatment as no tumor growth was observed in mice in the eight initial complete responders that were reinjected with the same mc38 cancer cells 

53 complete responders n15 with mouse ox40l mrna  αpdl1 in mc38 cpi refractory syngeneic 

mouse model study 

ox40l mrna2416 clinical data 

our interim data indicate that intratumoral treatment with ox40l mrna has no dose limiting toxicities and has led to clinical observations of tumor regression in two patients with ovarian cancer but the tumor regression at the doses studied do not meet recist criteria for partial responses in the phase 12 trial in the united states 

the phase 12 trial for mrna2416 is an openlabel multicenter study of repeated intratumoral injections of mrna2416 in patients with advanced relapsedrefractory solid tumor malignancies and lymphomas in the united states mrna2416 will be administered at day 1 and day 15 of a 28day cycle with a maximum of 6 cycles the objectives of this phase 12 study include evaluating safety and tolerability of mrna2416 administered intratumorally and to define the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion other endpoints include pharmacokinetic analyses as well as assessment of biomarkers of immunological response in tumor the dose levels being tested in the monotherapy arm of the trial were 1 mg 2 mg 4 mg and 8 mg the monotherapy arm of the study has been completed and we are not planning an expansion cohort of mrna2416 as a monotherapy we have initiated a dosefinding cohort at 4 mg mrna2416 given in combination with durvalumab imfinzi® followed by a phase 2 expansion cohort in ovarian cancer 

in the monotherapy arm of the study following completion of the safety cohort patients were enrolled into one of the following three biopsy cohorts 

 a schematic of the trial design is shown in the figure below 

as of february 12 2020 41 patients were dosed with mrna2416 39 patients in monotherapy and 2 patients in combination with durvalumab as of november 15 2018 safety was reported on 28 patients treated with monotherapy mrna2416 in approximately 18 of patients we have observed rapid onset of multiple grade 2 and a single grade 3 transient reversible injection related reactions all of which were resolved with antihistamines corticosteroids or supplemental oxygen three suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or susars were reported of the three one was the grade 3 serious adverse event or sae described above a second case was reported for a grade 2 noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the patient was kept overnight at the hospital in the third case a patient diagnosed with stage iiic ovarian carcinoma experienced a skin ulceration during treatment deemed to be a nonserious adverse event located within the injected tumor which had begun to regress following treatment with mrna2416 after the last administered dose of mrna2416 and after the patient withdrew from the trial for personal reasons the wound was smaller in size subsequently the patient underwent additional treatment for disease progression with cytoxanavastin the wound increased significantly in size and avastin was discontinued due to patient preference and wound healing concerns the patient was then hospitalized due to worsening of the skin ulceration by which time the injected tumor was noted to be absent though other lesions were present although no longer in the study this hospitalization was deemed by the investigator as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction related to study drug but deemed by us as possibly related to study drug after discharge from the hospital the patient died this death was reported to be due to disease progression not study drug after the intratumoral injection of mrna2416 in other patients no other skin ulceration has been observed related to study drug 

of the 26 patients dosed with mrna2416 as of october 22 2018 the best overall response was stable disease n6 including two patients with ovarian cancer in which there was tumor shrinkage in injected andor uninjected lesions 

we have collected and analyzed eight paired biopsies of tumors pre and postinjection of mrna2416 through october 22 2018 of these eight six paired biopsies are from injected lesions and two are from uninjected lesions in three of the six paired biopsies from injected lesions where tumors showed evidence of the location of the injection site and had viable tissue from the biopsy to analyze we have observed an increase in ox40l protein after mrna administration in one of these cases we have observed ox40l protein expression in the injected lesion for a biopsy collected at cycle 1 day 2 as shown by quantitative immunofluorescence staining in the figure below staining in red denotes ox40l protein and 4’6diamidino2phenylindole or dapi stains dna to indicate nuclei in blue cytokeratin staining in green indicates keratin filaments often used to mark epithelial cancer cells 

ox40l protein production in tumor cells of a patient with ovarian cancer dosed with mrna2416 



in the remaining three of the six paired biopsies from injected lesions we did not observe ox40l protein increase possibly because there was no noted evidence of injection site or there was extensive tissue necrosis 

ox40lil23il36 γ  triplet mrna2752 summary 

our immunooncology approach to transform the tumor microenvironment intratumoral injection of ox40lil23il36γ 

despite recent advances in immunemediated therapies for cancer the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer is poor we are developing triplet mrna2752 and other programs to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming cold tumor microenvironments into productive “hotter” immune landscapes with local intratumoral therapies triplet mrna2752 utilizes the intrinsic advantage of mrna to multiplex and to produce membrane and secreted proteins with mrna in a single investigational medicine triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding human ox40l interleukin 23 or il23 and 

interleukin 36 gamma or il36γ that are encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and administered intratumorally ox40l is a membrane protein whereas il23 and il36γ are secreted cytokines we believe our approach has the advantage of localized high concentration gradients of il23 and il36γ compared to recombinant proteins administered systemically or intratumorally additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which we believe recombinant protein technologies cannot enable the combination of ox40l il23 and il36γ has shown robust activity in preclinical cancer models and is synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors in addition this combination elicits an antitumor response on distal tumors via the “abscopal effect” as well as treated tumors in preclinical studies a phase 1 trial of triplet mrna2752 is ongoing 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 mechanistic overview 

triplet mrna2752 is designed and tailored to activate the immune system in two ways 

this potential mrna medicine is a novel mrnabased therapeutic agent containing multiple mrnas that code for the wild type human ox40l il23 and il36γ proteins that have distinct functions yet work synergistically in mediating anticancer responses triplet mrna2752 brings two approaches into a single multimechanism therapy 

 the generation of optimal t cell responses requires t cell receptor or tcr engagement by presented epitopes eg cancer antigens and a positive secondary signal achieved through costimulatory molecules like ox40 ox40 receptor also known as tnfrsf4 and cd134 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor or tnf receptor superfamily and is upregulated on activated immune effector cells upon tcr activation ox40 is endogenously stimulated via ox40l a homotrimeric membrane protein normally expressed on professional antigen presenting cells binding of ox40 by ox40l in the presence of a recognized antigen enhances the expansion of cd4 and cd8 t cells increases t cell effector function and enhances survival of experienced t cells for increased memory capacity therefore introduction of ox40l via mrna may serve to boost t cell responses we believe that in addition to boosting t cell responses via ox40l expression the expression of proinflammatory cytokines within a treated tumor may serve to ignite and transform an immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into a productive anticancer immune response the initial focus was on cytokines with wellestablished roles in initiating inflammation and bridging innate to adaptive immunity in humans namely the il1 and il12 families respectively specifically anticancer effects have been observed by introduction of il1 family member il36γ in preclinical mouse models of cancer il12 family members including il23 are often referred to as central coordinators of immune responses largely due to their capacity to bridge innate to adaptive immunity 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 our product concept 

the potential advantage of mrna to target multiple immunostimulatory pathways in tumors 

we are developing triplet mrna2752 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma as a single agent or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding ox40l il23 and il36γ encapsulated in our proprietary lnp triplet mrna2752 is designed to make these proteins in cells of the local tumor environment or lymph node our approach potentially has the advantage of localized gradients of two important cytokines il23 and il36γ rather than a systemic administration or intratumoral injection of cytokine proteins that would lead to quick diffusion away from the tumor additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which would be challenging to administer to either a tumor or systemically as a recombinant membrane protein capable of costimulation of t cells mrna for il23 produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il23a subunits with a linker between the subunits mrna for il36γ produces a protein with introduced signal peptide to bypass a need for upstream processing for release and activity in addition all three mrna were designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of microrna binding sites thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability an illustration of our approach for triplet mrna2752 is shown in the figure below

as described earlier preclinical work was conducted using mouse homologs the combination local therapy of ox40lil23il36γ mrnas achieved 70100 complete response rates in two mc38 syngeneic mouse models of cancer one that is normally relatively responsive and the other completely refractory to systemic checkpoint inhibitor treatment the triple combination therapy had better results than individual and doublet mrna combinations in one study mice carrying bilateral mc38s tumors received 5 µg total mrna injected into the right flank tumor only 25 µg each mrna administered for doublets and 167 µg each for triplet combinations the survival plots are graphed in the figure below survival events were triggered when animals surpassed the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3  for both tumors combined animals removed from study for other reasons were censored and indicated below as horizontal lines prior to day 100 20 mice were included in each cohort depicted and there were 10 11 and 20 complete responders ie no measurable disease at either tumor site for the il23il36γ il23ox40l and ox40lil23il36γ treatment groups respectively at 100 days post cancer cell implant we also found that a single dose of ox40lil23il36γ mrna was able to induce complete disease control at both treated and distal sites sometimes known as an abscopal effect this underscores the potential of our approach to lead to a welltolerated and broadly active therapy for treatment of multilesional and metastatic cancers 

100 n20 complete responders with mouse ox40lil23il36γ mrna in mc38 dual flank syngeneic mouse model study 

in addition to ox40lil23il36γ mrna monotherapy activity we have further observed that a single suboptimal dose of ox40lil23il36γ mrna therapy was synergistically active with systemically administered antipd1pdl1 as well as antictla4 antibodies again demonstrating complete response rates of   70

il12 medi1191 summary 

our immunooncology approach to transform the tumor microenvironment il12 as a localized secreted protein in collaboration with astrazeneca 

another strategy for cancer patients with immunologically cold tumors is to transform the tumor microenvironment by introducing proinflammatory cytokines directly into tumors or draining lymph nodes in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing medi1191 that is an mrna for il12 encapsulated in our proprietary lnp to be delivered intratumorally systemic administration of recombinant il12 protein was poorly tolerated in early clinical trials and exhibited generally low response rates medi1191 can enhance the immune response by positively impacting both antigen presenting cells and t cells and local intratumoral expression of il12 can potentially improve tolerability compared to systemic protein treatments astrazeneca is conducting a phase 1 clinical trial for medi1191 which is to be coadministered with a checkpoint inhibitor 

il12 medi1191 mechanistic overview 

il12 is a powerful immunemodulator that bridges innate and adaptive responses 

the il12 family members are often referred to as central controllers of immune responses due to their capacity to bridge from innate to adaptive immunity il12 is a potent immunemodulator typically associated with a type 1 immune response and production of interferongamma   while preclinical studies using il12 have resulted in dramatic antitumor effects in syngeneic cancer models clinical development of systemically administered recombinant il12 has been hampered by systemic toxicity 

il12 medi1191 our product concept 

in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing intratumoral delivery of il12 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor 

intratumoral delivery of il12 has been observed to be a feasible approach to overcome the toxicity associated with systemic il12 administration for example intratumoral delivery of an il12 containing dna plasmid by injection followed by electroporation has shown promising activity in combination with pembrolizumab in a phase 1 study with patients with metastatic melanoma such an approach may be limited to accessible lesions amenable to electroporation in contrast it may be more feasible to inject our mrna delivered by our proprietary lnp into both accessible and visceral tumors 

medi1191 is being developed for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor medi1191 consists of our proprietary lnp encapsulating an mrna for human il12b p40 and il12a p35 subunits the mrna produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il12a subunits with a linker between the subunits the mrna sequence has been engineered to enhance protein production and is designed to decrease the amount of protein that might be made in hepatocytes for better tolerability an illustration of our approach for il12 is shown in the figure below 

il12 medi1191 preclinical information 

we have conducted several preclinical studies in which we observed activity with our approach 

as described earlier our preclinical work was conducted with a mouse homolog of il12 in a tumor model that we have characterized as completely refractory to checkpoint therapy and associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 

treatment with il12 transformed the tumor microenvironment with notable activation of natural killer and dendritic cells and an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes in this checkpoint inhibitor refractory mouse model of cancer a single dose of il12 mrna yielded around 30 complete response rates as an mrna monotherapy as shown in panel a below and was synergistically active with systemically administered antipdl1 antibody or α pdl1 demonstrating complete response rates of   70 as shown in panel b of the figure below the xaxis represents days after subcutaneous implantation of mc38r tumor cells test articles were administered on day 11 for mrna treatments and on days 11 14 18 and 21 for antibody treatments all antibody treatments were administered at 20 mgkg there were 15 mice per group in this study survival curves were plotted by considering any reason a mouse was removed from study including the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3  as a survival event ntc is a nontranslating control mrna synergy of locally administered il12 mrna with systemic α pdl1 treatment was also observed on distal tumors that were not directly administered mrna

astrazeneca is the sponsor and leading the clinical development for medi1191 

we are responsible for generating a preclinical data package to support indcta filing and clinical supply for early clinical development astrazeneca will lead the early clinical development we expect a lower starting dose for medi1191 in the clinical trial compared to our other intratumoral programs 

an openlabel multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral injections of medi1191 alone and in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor durvalumab is ongoing 

iv program descriptions in our localized regenerative therapeutics modality 

we designed our localized regenerative therapeutics modality to develop mrna medicines to address injured or diseased tissues our mrna technology in this modality allows for the local production of proteins that provide a therapeutic benefit in the targeted tissue the development of our program in this modality azd8601 for the local production of vegfa is being led by our strategic collaborator astrazeneca this program recently completed a phase 1ab clinical trial in which we observed both a dosedependent protein production and a pharmacologic effect as measured by changes in local blood flow in patients we believe these data provide clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting as a potential therapeutic 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

localized regenerative therapeutics modality opportunity 

there are multiple applications for tissue regeneration with astrazeneca we have focused on ischemic heart failure for the first program coronary artery disease the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle in 2015 coronary artery disease resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally 

vegfa azd8601 program summary 

addressing ischemic heart failure—vegfa as a localized therapeutic in collaboration with astrazeneca 

heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states accounting for one in every four deaths and is often due to the inability of adult humans to regenerate heart tissue current approved therapies do not specifically address heart regeneration previous attempts at cardiac regeneration have included stem cell grafting and gene therapy but have faced challenges with safety or efficacy in collaboration with astrazeneca we are pioneering a unique approach to treating ischemic heart failure a condition where the cardiac muscle does not get enough blood supply to perform its contractile function vascular endothelial growth factor a or vegfa can promote cardiac tissue revascularization the goal of this program is to promote recovery of cardiac function through partial tissue regeneration the mrna in this program is in a saline formulation without lnps and is expected to act locally our strategic collaborator astrazeneca has conducted a phase 1ab clinical study in diabetic patients in europe the study has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of dosedependent protein production and changes in blood flow astrazeneca has moved this program to a phase 2a trial that is being conducted in europe and is designed to test safety and tolerability of epicardial injections for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery 

vegfa azd8601 disease overview 

vegfa can promote blood vessel growth to potentially address ischemic heart failure 

heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states accounting for one in every four deaths coronary artery disease or cad the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle cad resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally in 2015 

several treatments are available for patients with ischemic heart failure current treatments include revascularization of the coronary arteries to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac function and therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate excess fluids in congested tissues including betablockers angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii inhibitors and aldosterone receptor blockers as diuretics however adult humans are unable to regenerate myocardium tissue following injury and the treatment options described above cannot compensate for this 

vegfa is a potent angiogenic factor that promotes growth of blood vessels preclinical data suggests that expression of this growth factor in the ischemic heart could increase blood flow and partially restore cardiac function 

vegfa azd8601 our product concept 

local delivery of vegfa mrna to increase local concentration of vegfa protein while reducing systemic distribution of therapeutic vegfa protein 

vegfa protein acts as a powerful promoter of blood vessel growth systemic injection of vegfa protein increases vegfa exposure throughout the body which can lead to side effects but is very shortlived in circulation therefore any therapy involving vegfa needs to be localized to elevate local protein concentration and drive revascularization while minimizing systemic side effects astrazeneca has opted to pursue the localized application of vegfa mrna in a simple saline formulation in the heart muscle to elevate local protein concentration for longer periods due to increased local protein production this 

potentially allows for an extended pharmacodynamic effect at the specific site of injection compared to systemic or local administration of a recombinant protein version of vegfa some of the early animal work for mrna vegfa was published by our academic cofounder dr kenneth chien in  nature biotechnology  in 2013 showing improved cardiac function with increased survival with treatment 

vegfa azd8601 preclinical information 

astrazeneca has observed the activity of vegfa for ischemic heart failure in several preclinical animal models 

preclinical work has been conducted at astrazeneca in models of ischemic heart failure in mouse rat and pig models of myocardial infarction direct injection in the heart muscle myocardium of vegfa mrna led to elevated cardiac vegfa protein levels and improved cardiac function the data have been published by astrazeneca in  molecular therapy  in 2018 the table below illustrates the beneficial effects of azd8601 in the mini pig two months after the myocardial infarct procedure and injection of the vegfa mrna in this table left ventricular ejection fraction or lvef was measured using echocardiography two months after intracardial mrna administered 7 days after myocardial infarction the data are means ± standard error of the means 

significant improvement in lvef with vegf mrna measured 2 months after administration in mini pig study 



vegfa azd8601 clinical data 

astrazeneca has completed a phase 1ab trial in germany a phase 2a trial is currently ongoing in finland and an additional clinical trial application has been filed in the netherlands for this study 

the phase1ab clinical trial for the azd8601 program has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of protein production and changes in blood flow post azd8601 administration astrazeneca has moved this program to a phase 2a trial 

the phase 1ab study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus vegfa mrna was administered by intradermal injection into the forearm skin in single ascending doses the study was conducted in europe the primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product into the forearm skin with safety followup for 6 months 

the study was divided into part a single ascendingdose cohorts and part b pharmacodynamic cohort there were three treatment regimens in part a regimens were either azd8601 at site 1 and placebo at site 2 placebo at site 1 and azd8601 at site 2 or placebo at both sites each regimen comprised six 50 µl injections at one site and six 50 µl injections at a second site on the forearm in part b the regimen comprised one 50 µl intradermal injection of either azd8601 or placebo at each of four sites on the forearm 

there were 27 patients in part a with 18 receiving azd8601 in at least one site of the forearm and 9 patients receiving placebo there were three dose cohorts in part a each with 9 patients in the first cohort azd8601 dose was at 24 µg per patient 4 µg per injection the azd8601 dose was increased to 72 µg and 360 µg in the next two dose cohorts there were 15 patients in part b receiving azd8601 in at least two sites on the forearm per patient in part b each patient received 200 µg of azd8601 or placebo 

vegfa protein post injection of mrna was produced at a high level above the set expected threshold as shown in the figure below expression was measured by skin microdialysis at each sampling time mean vegfa protein levels across all mrna treated sites from patients across all cohorts were higher than that of placebo up to the 2426 hour time point data are means with error bars showing standard error of the mean or sem asterisk indicates pvalue 005 

vegfa protein levels in patients in part a of the phase 1ab trial 

the bioactivity of the vegfa protein post injection of mrna was observed by an increase in blood flow at injection sites up to 7 days following a single injection as shown in the figure below measurements were made using laser doppler imaging 7 and 14 days after administration study part a n  27 data shown are means with error bars showing sem asterisk indicates pvalue 005 

vegfa led to increase in blood flow at day 7 and day 14 in patients in the phase 1ab trial 

as shown above administration of azd8601 demonstrated protein production and changes in local blood flow in diabetic patients tolerability of our mrna injected intradermally was demonstrated for all dose levels the only causally treatmentrelated adverse events were mild injectionsite reactions occurring in 32 of 33 participants receiving vegfa mrna across both parts of the study design all adverse events of injectionsite reaction were of mild intensity no deaths serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred a list of adverse events is provided in the table below 

adverse events for the phase 1ab trial for azd8601 



 the program is currently in a phase 2a clinical trial it is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multicenter phase 2a study to evaluate safety and tolerability of epicardial injections of azd8601 during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery some of the outcomes to be monitored in the phase 2a study include adverse and serious adverse events electrocardiogram or ecg and lvef the study is being conducted in europe the study is intentionally designed to provide initial safety and tolerability data in about 24 coronary artery bypass patients 

v program descriptions in our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality 

we designed our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality to increase levels of desired proteins in circulation or in contact with the extracellular environment we aim to use cells in the human body to produce proteins encoded by mrna that are secreted to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide secreted proteins such as antibodies or enzyme replacement therapies across a wide range of diseases such as heart failure infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases this modality has benefitted from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation 

in early 2020 we changed the name of the systemic secreted therapeutics modality to the systemic secreted  cell surface therapeutics modality like our prophylactic vaccine modality we have designated this as a core modality based on the phase 1 clinical data we have reported specifically in our antibody against the chikungunya virus mrna1944 program 

this modality currently has five programs our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality opportunity 

the ability to systemically deliver mrna for a therapeutic effect would allow us to address a number of diseases of high unmet medical need systemically delivered secreted therapeutics address conditions often treated with recombinant proteins that are typically administered to the blood stream these current therapies include 

 our approach 

our systemic secreted and cell surface therapeutics modality comprises programs where mrnas instruct various cells of the human body to secrete proteins for therapeutic effect for systemic therapeutic programs that utilize cells in the liver the liver is a highly productive tissue for secreted protein production the human liver can make tens of grams of proteins per day well above the amounts necessary for the pharmacologic effect for virtually all protein therapeutics we have demonstrated that mrna can make and secrete monoclonal antibodies and soluble modulating factors in nonhuman primates these proteins made in nonhuman primates can exert their pharmacological activity by binding to targets with biological effect 

the antibody against chikungunya virus is our first systemic secreted therapeutic and patients are currently being dosed in a phase 1 study it will help us understand the fundamental relationship between mrna dose and secreted protein production the secreted human antibody is also a protein complex not ordinarily made by the liver which will be a test case for making human proteins in liver normally made by other cell types 

this modality also includes engineered proteins such as our relaxin and pku programs and is not limited to native forms of proteins recombinant protein therapeutics which focus on secreted proteins generate over 200 billion in annual worldwide sales 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 summary 

systemic mrna administration to instruct cells to secrete antibodies in this case for passive immunization to prevent chikungunya infection 

we are using this program to help understand how mrna can be used to make complex secreted proteins in the human body and to address the potential health threat of chikungunya virus particularly for the military and others exposed to this virus this program highlights a potentially important advancement of our platform and expansion of our modalities 

chikungunya is a serious health problem with and is estimated to have caused at least three million cases during the 20052015 epidemic there are no vaccines or prophylactic treatments for this disease this virus can cause severe arthriticlike conditions in approximately 15 of the infected people this program offers a passive immunization approach using antibodies to prevent infection to complement our vaccine approach in this program we utilize two mrnas encoding for light chain and heavy chain of an antibody against the envelope glycoprotein e we plan to administer these mrnas encapsulated in our proprietary lnps 

intravenously to people to prevent infection by the chikungunya virus we are being financially supported for specific activities by darpa and have an open ind for mrna1944 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 disease overview 

addressing a significant global health need 

chikungunya virus is a mosquitoborne alphavirus posing a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions while chikungunya has been present in africa for centuries recent outbreaks and epidemics in new regions have arisen due to the expanding distribution of the  aedes  mosquito in which it resides a chikungunya epidemic beginning in 2004 in kenya spread to india and was exported to nearly all regions of the world and brought chikungunya to the attention of the western world as of april 2016 chikungunya cases had been reported in 103 countries and territories around the world including 46 countries and territories throughout the americas chikungunya virus infection is characterized by an acute onset of fever rash myalgia and sometimes debilitating polyarthralgia giving the virus its name which means “that which bends up” when translated from makonde it is rarely fatal but neurological sequelae such as guillainbarre syndrome and chronic arthritis have been recognized 

chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of the togaviridae family with a positivestrand rna genome the viral structural proteins are naturally expressed as a single polyprotein followed by subsequent cleavage by viral and cellular proteases into capsid c and envelope e glycoproteins e3 e2 6k and e1 the e proteins are major targets of protective neutralizing antibody responses that can be tested for in assays 

there are currently no effective therapies or approved vaccines to treat or prevent chikungunya infection or disease and effective mosquito control has proven challenging even in higher income countries currently infected individuals are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to relieve some symptoms therefore in addition to an effective prophylactic vaccine we believe there is a need for systemic secreted antibody for passive immunity to the chikungunya virus 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 our product concept 

a systemically delivered mrna instructing cells to secrete an antibody to glycoprotein e to neutralize chikungunya 

the mrna1944 development candidate contains two mrnas that encode the heavy and light chains of the chikungunya antibody and utilizes our proprietary lnps the mrna1944 development candidate encodes a fully human igg antibody isolated from b cells of a patient with a prior history of chikungunya infection thus mrna1944 encodes a fully human igg antibody against the envelope protein e2 the systemic antibody against chikungunya virus titers can be evaluated in clinical trials by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or elisa to quantify the amount of expressed igg a neutralization assay can be used to ensure that the mrna expressed antibody was properly folded and functional 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 preclinical information 

systemic mrna administration results in antibody production and protection from chikungunya infection in animals 

in immunodeficient ag129 mice lacking the ifnαß and  γ  receptors chikungunya causes a lethal disease and mice succumb to infection within 34 days with ruffled fur and weight loss protection in this model is mediated by antibodies against the chikungunya viral proteins that must provide complete protection or sterilizing immunity therefore this challenge model was used to establish a correlate of protection using activity and systemic igg concentration data 

an  in vivo  study in ag129 mice was completed to determine the activity of mrna encoded antibody against chikungunya virus the test article was administered to mice as prophylaxis at 002 01 and 05 mgkg by iv tail injection a subset of animals n10 were challenged 24 hours post prophylaxis with chikungunya virus strain lr006 and monitored for morbidity and mortality complete survival of mice was observed after treatment with the highest dose of 05 mgkg of mrna1944 

in addition the pharmacokinetics were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys through intravenous infusion at 03 10 and 30 mgkg the average serum antibody level was quantified at various time points to demonstrate a halflife of 23 days the maximum serum concentration of the antibody was found to be 162 µgml with dose 1 and 288 µgml with dose 2 as shown in the figure below 

expression of antibody against chikungunya virus with repeat dosing of mrna1944 or placebo in nonhuman primate study 

in addition mrna1944 was tested in rats and nonhuman primates in a repeatdose study via iv infusion up to 5 and 3 mgkg respectively there were no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna1944 observed and all other observations were generally reversible 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 clinical data 

we recently announced positive interim data from the first analysis of safety and activity in the phase 1 study of mrna1944 administered via intravenous infusion in healthy adults 

we are conducting a phase 1 doseescalation study in healthy adults that is randomized and placebocontrolled the objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses 01 03 06 mgkg dose levels without dexamethasone included in the premedication regimen a dose level cohort at 06 mgkg dose level with dexamethasone included in the premedication regimen with 8 subjects per cohort of mrna1944 administered via intravenous infusion in addition there is a dose level cohort in which subjects will be administered two iv infusions of 03mgkg one infusion on day 1 and another subsequent infusion on day 8 without dexamethasone in the premedication regimen no further dose escalation beyond 06 mgkg is planned other objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics of all dose levels of mrna1944 to determine if the antibodies produced are sufficiently active to neutralize viral infection in assays and to determine the pharmacodynamics of antichikungunya virus igg levels each of the dose level cohorts initially doses three sentinel subjects with a sevenday interval between each sentinel subject safety data on each sentinel subject as well as cumulative safety data are reviewed by the internal safety team or ist seven days following infusion of mrna1944 prior to the second and third sentinel subjects are dosed as per the schematic described below the ist will also review safety data for the three sentinels and recommend expansion to five subjects at that dose level with an overall randomization ratio of 32 mrna1944placebo the safety monitoring committee or smc reviews the safety data for the dose level and recommend escalation to the next dose level a schematic of the trial design is shown below 

as of february 12 2020 dose level cohorts 01 03 06 mgkg without dexamethasone in the premedication regimen and dose level cohort 06 mgkg with dexamethasone in the premedication regimen have been completed 

as of september 2019 at all dose levels tested 01 03 and 06 mgkg all participants exceeded the levels of antibody expected to be protective against chikungunya infection  1 μgml following a single dose with the middle and high doses projected to maintain antibody levels above protective levels for at least 16 weeks as shown in the panel below the average serum antibody level was quantified at various time points to demonstrate a halflife of 62 days no significant adverse events were observed at the low and middle doses infusionrelated adverse events were observed at the high dose which resolved spontaneously without treatment

relaxin azd7970 summary 

in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing a secreted systemic engineered protein for heart failure 

chronic heart failure continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide while numerous treatments are currently available the needs of many heart failure patients are not met relaxin is a wellstudied natural protein hormone that is known to have cardiovascular protective effects earlier attempts at developing relaxin as a protein therapeutic have failed serelaxin a recombinant relaxin protein therapeutic with a short 30 minute halflife recently failed to meet its primary endpoints in a phase 3 trial we believe that engineering the relaxin protein for a longer duration and repeat dosing might overcome the shortcomings of earlier attempts in collaboration with astrazeneca we use mrna encoding for a relaxin protein designed for a long duration of action it is also designed to be produced by the body with human posttranslational modifications 

relaxin azd7970 disease overview 

heart failure continues to be a major health concern despite multiple treatment options 

heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump blood efficiently and presents itself as either an impairment of ejection of the blood systolic heart failure or defective ventricular filling diastolic heart failure it is associated with fluid retention in peripheral tissues including the lungs leading to tissue congestion dyspnea fatigue and ultimately death heart failure is a major unmet medical need as it is the leading cause of hospitalization in the elderly worldwide and accounts for 11 million cases annually in the united states the aging population and the improved survival rates from myocardial infarcts have increased the lifetime risk of developing heart failure to one in five 

current treatments for heart failure include therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate the excess of fluid in congested tissues betablockers angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii inhibitors and aldosterone receptor blockers despite longterm combined treatments the needs for these patients are often unmet as evidenced by the high mortality rate in this patient population ie 365 in a median 3year followup 

relaxin is a naturally occurring hormone present in both men and women that has been shown to promote vasodilation and angiogenesis regulate extracellular matrix turnover and suppress arrhythmias post myocardial infarction though prior studies have failed to demonstrate longterm benefit in clinical studies we believe that our novel approach can overcome potential flaws of previous approaches 

relaxin azd7970 our product concept 

we have engineered a longacting relaxin to extend its otherwise short halflife 

azd7970 is an mrna encoding a human relaxin protein designed and engineered to have an extended halflife we have also utilized our proprietary lnps to enable repeat dosing we believe azd7970 can address the short halflife of serelaxin azd7970 is intended for ivadministered repeat dosing 

relaxin azd7970 preclinical information 

we have observed extended exposure with our mrna encoding for an engineered version of relaxin 

we have observed that relaxin mrna gives rise to a longlasting systemic and functional protein following iv dosing with proprietary lnps prolonged duration of relaxin protein production was observed both in rodents and nonhuman primates systemic protein levels of the relaxin protein in plasma of iv dosed cynomolgus monkeys following a single injection of mrna were assessed using a commercially available antibody exposure to the fusion protein made from our mrna was considerably extended up to 10 days as shown in the figure below in contrast earlier published studies described the halflife of relaxin administered as a recombinant protein to be of a few minutes an indenabling glp toxicology program for relaxin azd7970 is ongoing

fabry disease mrna3630 summary 

our approach to fabry disease with a secreted alpha galactosidase protein 

fabry disease is an xlinked hereditary defect in glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by mutations in the  gla  gene which encodes for the lysosomal protein alpha galactosidase or αgal it is one of several lysosomal storage diseases decreased activity of αgal results in the lysosomal accumulation of substrates gb3 and lysogb3 within cells and tissues ultimately impairing celltissue function currently there are several approved therapies for the treatment of fabry disease including enzyme replacement therapy or ert and chaperone therapy however patients continue to suffer from renal decline and have immunogenic side effects with ert usage in addition patient eligibility with chaperone therapy is limited to amenable mutation status with our platform technology the cells in the human body can be instructed to produce αgal from the liver and other tissues to properly target αgal into lysosomes additionally these tissues can secrete it into circulation for delivery to the lysosomes of other tissues we are developing an intravenously administered mrna that encodes αgal enzyme and we plan to conduct a phase 12 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mrna3630 in fabry patients 

fabry disease mrna3630 disease overview 

fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder 

fabry disease is a progressive multiorgan xlinked lysosomal storage disorder with an annual incidence of approximately 180000 affected individuals have a deficiency in αgal resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes thus patients accumulate glycosphingolipids such as gb3 within lysosomes which ultimately results in cellular and tissue dysfunction in fabry patients multiple organs are impacted including the vasculature kidney heart and the gastrointestinal and neurological systems the severity of the disease is related to the lack of enzyme activity in patient cells classic fabry patients are the most affected individuals and generally retain 1 of normal enzyme activity diagnosis of fabry disease occurs generally during childhood but in some patients it is diagnosed later in life usually after the patient presents with a stroke or renal complications 

currently there are several approved therapies for the treatment of fabry disease agalsidase beta which is marketed as fabrazyme by sanofi genzyme and agalsidase alpha which is approved and marketed as replagal outside the united states by shire are enzyme replacement therapies or erts administered to most fabry patients both of those therapies are versions of αgal erts that are administered intravenously often require long infusion times and can lead to undesired immune reactions these enzymes are effective at decreasing substrate accumulation in some tissues and slowing disease progression however patients that have been on erts for 10 years still have renal function decline at a rate greater than normal healthy individuals in addition to erts amicus therapeutics has received marketing approval in many jurisdictions including the united states and european union for migalastat a small molecule chaperone therapy which treats a subset of patients 

fabry disease mrna3630 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce and secrete  α gal 

the mrna encoding αgal is designed to instruct the cells of the human body to produce complex functional intracellular proteins for utilization in the lysosome and secretion out of the cell for uptake by other tissues this is intended to replace the enzyme αgal insufficient or missing in fabry patients our mrna3630 program consists of an mrna encoding human αgal encapsulated in our proprietary lnp the mrna sequence is optimized for protein expression mrna3630 will be administered intravenously to encode enzymaticallyactive αgal protein to restore this deficient or defective enzyme 

an illustration of our approach is shown in the figure below the mrna encoding for αgal once inside the cell is translated to αgal protein by ribosomes and translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum the protein sequences traverse the secretory pathway of the cell the protein is either sent to the lysosome where it reduces the level of gb3 in target cells or is directed for secretion outside the cells allowing for broad distribution of the protein 

fabry disease mrna3630 preclinical information 

with a single dose of our mrna encoding for  α gal we observed a sustained reduction in lysogb3 

we have conducted several  in vivo  pharmacology studies to demonstrate nonclinical proofofconcept for αgal therapy administration of proprietary lnp formulated αgal mrna to the fabry mouse model resulted in a significant and durable reduction of globotriaosylsphingosine or lysogb3 in tissue and serum for 12 weeks following a single dose as shown in the figure below in this study there were 3 fabry gla  mice per group data was normalized to the control sequence group for the specific time point 

reduction in lysogb3 in tissue with single administration of  α gal mrna in mouse model study 

in addition we have evaluated plasma αgal in nonhuman primates following iv administration of 05 mgkg mrna3630 every other week for four doses there were four animals per group these data indicate consistent circulation of enzyme in circulation following repeated administrations as shown in the figure below 

repeat dosing of  α gal mrna in nonhuman primate study 

anti αgal antibodies were not detected in these animals nonhuman primate tissues were examined after the last dose and showed greater than wildtype levels of enzyme as determined by activity assessment and shown in the figure below the indenabling glp toxicology program for mrna3630 is ongoing

autoimmune therapeutic area mrna6981 and mrna6231 introduction 

our company strategy continues to be to invest in our platform technology and scalable infrastructure to pursue a pipeline of potential medicines that reflect the breadth of the mrna opportunity in january 2020 we announced the entry into a fifth therapeutic area autoimmune diseases building on the clinical validation of the systemic delivery of mrna provided by the phase 1 clinical proof of concept of the chikungunya antibody program autoimmune diseases are characterized by immune activation in response to antigens normally present in the body reflecting a loss of tolerance within this therapeutic area we are developing two potential medicines mrna6981 and mrna6231 designed to engage peripheral tolerance pathways to dampen autoimmune activation and help restore immune homeostasis thereby reducing autoimmune pathology in this modality mrna is delivered systemically to create proteins that are either secreted or expressed on the cell surface 

our approach to the treatment of autoimmune diseases is to leverage mechanisms of peripheral tolerance to modulate the immune system’s reaction to selfantigens 

scientific and technical advances enable our expansion into new therapeutic areas the latest of which is autoimmune disease autoimmune diseases are defined by pathology resulting from an adaptive immune response against an antigen or antigens normally present within the body pathology is present in a variety of organs across autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus inflammatory bowel disease psoriasis type 1 diabetes multiple sclerosis autoimmune hepatitis and related disorders such as graft vs host disease autoimmune diseases affect millions of patients worldwide many of whose disease is not wellcontrolled by existing treatment options and represent billions of dollars in healthcare costs 

in healthy people autoimmune reactions are prevented or controlled by mechanisms of tolerance lymphocytes eg t and b cells that are reactive against selfantigens are deleted during development thus establishing central tolerance central tolerance is not completely protective and so other mechanisms collectively known as peripheral tolerance act on any selfreactive lymphocytes that escape central tolerance to control potential autoimmune pathology these mechanisms of peripheral tolerance include induction of a reversible state of cellular nonresponsiveness in selfreactive cells called anergy and expression of inhibitory receptors or cytokines by other cells such as dendritic cells macrophages and regulatory t cells “tregs” the immune system works constantly to maintain balance between a state of immune activation and immune tolerance sometimes called homeostasis we are developing two potential medicines we believe have the potential to engage peripheral tolerance mechanisms to dampen autoimmune activation and help restore immune homeostasis pdl1 mrna6981 aims to induce the expression of this inhibitory receptor on myeloid cells and il2 mrna6231 aims to preferentially increase the number of tregs 

pdl1 mrna6981 mechanistic overview 

pdl1 is a coinhibitory receptor that can induce anergy in programmed cell death protein 1 “pd1”expressing t cells 

antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells form stable cellcell junctions with t and b cells called immune synapses to communicate in three ways signal 1 antigen presentation and recognition signal 2 costimulatory signals to activate the cell and signal 3 cytokines chemokines and certain metabolites to activate repress or modulate the immune response when immune synapses occur in the context of high levels of coinhibition such as high levels of pdl1 expressed on antigen presenting cells this may result in the induction of peripheral regulatory t cells induction of a reversible nonresponsive state called anergy or death of autoreactive lymphocytes due to removal of critical survival signals given their role in adaptive immune responses and their involvement in autoimmune disorders dendritic cells and other myeloid populations have become a target of recent immunotherapies 

  

the pdl1pd1 pathway has a critical function in immune regulation and promotes development and function of tregs pdl1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on antigen presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages activated t cells b cells and monocytes as well as peripheral tissues its cognate receptor pd1 is a coinhibitory transmembrane protein expressed on t cells b cells natural killer cells and thymocytes engagement of pd1 to pdl1 results in decreased il2 production and glucose metabolism with continued engagement leading to induction of t cell anergy or conversion of naïve cells into peripheral regulatory t cells engagement of pdl1 with pd1 also inhibits t cell proliferation cytotoxic activity and cytokine production and suppresses the reactivation of previously activated t effector cells 

preclinical mouse models deficient in pd1 spontaneously develop a variety of autoimmune diseases such as arthritis myocarditis lupuslike glomerulonephritis and type 1 diabetes demonstrating the critical role of the pdl1pd1 interaction in maintaining tolerance to selfantigens additionally treatment of cancer patients with pd1 or pdl1 inhibitors sometimes results in immunerelated adverse events including the development of hepatitis dermatitis and colitis demonstrating the role of pd1pdl1 in human autoimmune reactions 

we believe our pdl1 therapy may augment pdl1 expression on cell types similar to those that endogenously express it and by reducing immune activation potentially reduce the clinical manifestations of a variety of autoimmune diseases 

pdl1 mrna6981 our product concept 

we intend to induce expression of pdl1 on myeloid cells to send a tolerizing signal to immune cells in their environment in order to treat autoimmune diseases 

our intent is to use our platform to influence myeloid cells including dendritic cells to provide additional coinhibitory signals by augmenting endogenous expression of pdl1 we believe that this tolerizing signal to lymphocytes may limit autoreactivity in the context of ongoing autoimmune pathology without severe and global suppression of the immune system given that our platform allows us to modify myeloid cells in situ  our approach to the creation of a tolerogenic environment may provide unique benefits in 

treating autoimmune diseases by seeking to restore immune homeostasis we believe the platform technologies used have already been substantially validated in humans mrna6981 employs the same delivery technology used in clinical trials for our chikungunya antibody therapeutic mrna1944 results with mrna1944 demonstrate predictable dosedependent pharmacology that translated effectively from preclinical species into humans 

  

pdl1 mrna6981 preclinical information 

we have observed disease modification in a range of preclinical models 

we have investigated the effect of mrna6981 in multiple disease models in one example we evaluated mrna6981 in a rat model of arthritis animals were given a single injection of chicken collagen type ii in incomplete freund’s adjuvant in order to induce chronic arthritislike symptoms mrna6981 was dosed subcutaneously at four times per week and compared to a negative pbs control and a positive control of daily high dose dexamethasone dex arthritislike symptoms included paw swelling and joint rigidity which were scored as a proxy for disease severity compared to animals treated with pbs animals treated with pdl1 mrna presented with consistently less severe disease similar to animals treated daily with dexamethasone for at least three weeks 

collageninduced arthritis model 

we have investigated mrna6981 in a range of other preclinical models of autoimmune and related diseases including type 1 diabetes colitis and graftversushost disease and observed diseasemodifying activity 

pdl1 mrna6981 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial for patients with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis “aih” 

aih is an autoimmune condition involving inflammation in the liver which over time can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure type 1 aih is characterized by a specific autoantibody profile and afflicts more than 75000 patients in the us type 1 aih is typically treated with steroids and azathioprine but some patients either do not respond to these treatments or are unable to tolerate them and are therefore in need of alternatives a specific role for pdl1 therapy in treating type 1 aih is supported by clinical observations in cancer patients receiving pd1pdl1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment a noted adverse event is the development of aih which responds to discontinuation of checkpoint inhibitor therapy and treatment with corticosteroids checkpoint inhibitorinduced aih has an identical histological and clinical manifestation compared to nondrug induced type 1 aih we believe that mrna6981 may provide benefit to type 1 aih patients by increasing pdl1 expression and plan to pursue proofofconcept in type 1 aih as a first step to addressing a range of autoimmune indications we are planning a clinical trial to evaluate the safety tolerability pharmacology and duration of the effect of mrna6981 in type 1 aih patients refractory or intolerant to the standard of care 

il2 mutein mrna6231 mechanistic overview 

il2 is a critical cytokine for treg activation and expansion 

cytokines are potent modulators of the immune system directing function and homeostasis il2 is critically important to t cell survival and function il2 acts through a receptor complex that can be dimeric il2rß “cd122” plus the common γ chain “cd132” or trimeric which is formed through the addition of il2rα “cd25” to the dimeric form the trimeric form has 10 

fold to 100fold greater affinity for il2 under low or homeostatic il2 conditions those cells which preferentially express the trimeric receptor or il2r such as tregs and very recently activated effector t cells are activated conversely those cells that express the dimeric form such as naïve or antigenexperienced cytotoxic t cells and natural killer cells “nk cells” are only activated by much higher concentrations of il2 tregs play an obligate role in maintaining peripheral tolerance through the control of effector t cell responses and several strategies are being developed to exploit il2 to treat autoimmune disease by selectively enhancing treg function these include recombinant protein forms of il2mab complexes il2 muteins and lowdose il2 

il2 mutein mrna6231 our product concept 

we intend to utilize subcutaneous mrna administration to produce a version of il2 that is potentially longer acting and more selective for the trimeric il2 receptor “il2r” in order to treat autoimmune diseases 

il2based therapeutics are being clinically evaluated for a wide range of immunemediated disorders including rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus erythematosus graft versus host disease inflammatory bowel diseases and autoimmune hepatitis we believe that our platform can be exploited to produce a modified il2 for the treatment of autoimmune conditions our modified il2 is engineered with mutations that selectively decrease binding to the dimeric il2 receptor present on cd4 and cd8 t effector cells and nk cells and increase reliance upon cd25 of the trimeric il2 receptor complex to trigger the signaling cascade in regulatory t cells our modified il2 is also expressed as a fusion protein to extend its halflife in the serum this will be the first demonstration of subcutaneous administration of the delivery technology used in clinical trials for our chikungunya antibody therapeutic mrna1944 

  

il2 mutein mrna6231 preclinical information 

we have observed preferential expansion of tregs in nonhuman primates 

preclinical work has been conducted using mouse homologs as well as cynomolgus monkeys in one example monkeys were dosed subcutaneously with a single dose of mrna6231 and t cells in the peripheral blood were monitored on days 1 3 5 8 and 14 the percentage of tregs cd4 t cells that were also foxp3 increased about 12fold average across n4 animals at their maximum day 8 postdosing conversely the percentage of activated cd8 conventional t cells that coexpress cd25 did not significantly increase over baseline at any time during the monitoring period illustrating the preferential expansion of tregs by the il2 mutein 

il2 mutein mrna6231 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers to assess safety tolerability pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 

we plan to conduct a phase 1 dose escalation study of mrna6231 in adult healthy volunteers the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna6231 to assess the pharmacodynamic response through treg selective expansion activation and duration and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of mrna6231 in expressing il2 in the serum following subcutaneous administration 

  

vi program descriptions in our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality 

we designed our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality to increase levels of intracellular proteins we aim to use cells in the human body to produce proteins encoded by mrna that are located in the cytosol or specific organelles of the cell to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide intracellular proteins such as intracellular enzymes and organellespecific proteins as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies our initial focus within this modality is on rare genetic diseases 

this modality currently has four programs our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic intracellular therapeutics modality opportunity 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics focus on areas currently not addressable with recombinant proteins which are typically administered systemically and cannot reach the inside of the cell objectives for potential new therapies in this area include increasing the levels of 

 methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 summary 

program aims to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme to treat a pediatric genetic metabolic disorder 

isolated methylmalonic academia or mma is a rare lifethreatening inherited metabolic disorder that is primarily caused by a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonylcoenzyme a mutase or mut it primarily affects the pediatric population there is no approved therapy that addresses the underlying disorder including no approved enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of the protein and its mitochondrial localization liver or combined liverkidney transplant is one option for severely affected individuals our platform may allow the cells in the human body to produce these and other complex mitochondrial enzymes therefore we are developing an intravenously ivadministered mrna encoding mut in our proprietary lnp in order to restore this deficient or defective mitochondrial enzyme in the liver and other cells we have observed preclinical proofofconcept in two different mma mouse models notably with a marked improvement in survival and reduction of biochemical abnormalities in a severe mma mouse model we have received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission the fda has also designated the investigation of mrna3704 for the treatment of isolated mma due to mut deficiency as a fast track development program we have initiated a phase 12 clinical trial in mma patients with mut deficiency and as of february 12 2020 we have enrolled the first patient in the trial this patient has entered an observational period prior to treatment which evaluates the patient’s baseline disease prior to starting the treatment period 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 disease overview 

mma is a rare lifethreatening pediatric disorder with no approved therapies that address the underlying defect 

mma associated with mut deficiency is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality there are approximately 5002000 mma mut deficiency patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0312100000 newborns and mortality rates mortality is significant with mortality rates of 50 for mma patients with complete mut deficiency mut 0  median age of death 2 years and 40 for mma patients with partial mut deficiency mut   median age of death 45 years reported in a large european study 

mma mainly affects the pediatric population and usually presents in the first few days or weeks of life the occurrence of acute metabolic decompensations is the hallmark of the disorder and decompensations are typically more frequent in the first few years of life each decompensation is lifethreatening and often requires hospitalization and management at an intensive care unit surviving patients often suffer from numerous complications including chronic renal failure and neurologic complications such as movement disorders developmental delays and seizures consequently the healthrelated quality of life for mma patients and their families is significantly impaired 

the disorder is autosomal recessive and primarily caused by lossoffunction mutations in the gene encoding mut a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes certain proteins and fats resulting in complete mut 0  or partial mut   enzyme deficiency 

over 250 mutations have been reported to date for mut with many mma patients carrying private mutations the most frequent mutations include pn219y and pr369h occurring with allelic frequencies of 8 in a large european cohort n151 populationspecific mutations have been reported such as the pr108c and pg717v mutations identified in hispanic and africanamerican patients respectively due to a deficiency in the mut enzyme resulting in a blockage in a metabolic pathway the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as methylmalonic acid in all body fluids and tissues 

there are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for mma carglumic acid marketed as carbaglu is approved in the eu for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including mma liver transplant and combined liverkidney transplant have emerged as effective treatment options for severely affected individuals resulting in substantial reductions in metabolic decompensations and circulating methylmalonic acid concentrations 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 our product concept 

we are utilizing our ability to produce a complex intracellular enzyme mut that is localized to the mitochondria 

mut is a complex intracellular enzyme that exists as a homodimer and requires mitochondrial localization and engagement with its cofactor a derivative of vitamin b 12   to be enzymatically active mrna has the capability to encode any type of protein including a functional intracellular protein that is trafficked to the proper subcellular localization within target cells 

we are developing an mrna encoding human mut encapsulated in our proprietary lnps for intravenous or iv administration for the treatment of isolated mma associated with mut deficiency the sequence has been engineered to improve protein translation to function the mrnaencoded mut protein is translocated to its site of action in the mitochondria as shown in the figure below 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 preclinical information 

we have observed pronounced improvement in survival due to mrna treatment in an mma mouse model 

we have conducted a series of  in vitro  and  in vivo  pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for human mut mrna in two different mouse models of mma representing the spectrum of mut deficiency mut 0  and mut    as published by us in  cell reports  in 2017 as an example a 12week repeatdose study in mma mut 0  mice  mut   tg insmck mut  at 05 mgkg iv every other week has shown a pronounced improvement in survival due to human mut mrna treatment with all treated mice surviving 12 weeks in contrast to control mice which all perished within a few weeks the figure below shows the kaplanmeier curve of pbsinjected n6 mice and human mut mrna n6 mice treated mma mut 0  mice and pbsinjected n6 mice healthy heterozygote mice the three asterisks indicate pvalue  0001 for human mut mrna vs pbsinjected mma mut 0  mice from the logrank test 

improved survival in a 12week study with mrna encoding for human mut in mouse disease model study 

in addition the data indicated that the treated mma mut 0  mice doubled their body weights and approached the body weights of pbsinjected healthy mice in this 12week repeat dose study in contrast surviving pbsinjected mma mut 0  mice did not gain weight 

increase in body weight in a 12week study with mrna encoding human mut in mouse disease model study 

hmut mrna treated mma mut 0  mice showed significant and sustained reductions in the toxic disease metabolites including plasma methylmalonic acid compared to pretreatment levels in a 6week repeat dose study in mma mut 0  mice this is shown in the figure below arrows denote weekly iv administration of human mut mrna 02 mgkg plasma was collected 4 days prior to treatment and 3 days after each dose administration washout levels were for the 10day washout following 5 th  dose administration of human mut mrna the asterisk indicates a pvalue  001 from paired ttests of posttreatment vs pretreatment levels 

decrease in plasma methylmalonic acid in 6week repeat dose study with mrna encoding for human mut in mma mut 0  mouse model study 

additionally a pharmacokinetic study performed in wild type mice demonstrated that human mut can be elevated above wild type level mut levels specifically human mut protein expression in liver peaked at 16 hours after a single iv injection of human mut mrna 05 mgkg with a concentration of 85 ngmg protein 23 fold higher than endogenous human and mouse mut in liver 

there were no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna3704 in juvenile rats and immature nonhuman primates in a repeat iv dose onemonth indenabling glp toxicology study up to the top doses tested an independent indenabling glp cardiovascular safety study in nonhuman primates also indicated mrna3704 showed no doselimiting toxicities 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 clinical plan 

we are conducting a global natural history study and a phase 12 clinical trial in the united states and europe 

we are conducting a global natural history study in methylmalonic acidemia or mma and propionic acidemia or pa that was initiated in 2018 some of the patients participating in the natural history study may enter our interventional clinical trials 

our natural history study aims to identify and correlate clinical and biomarker endpoints for both mma and pa we also have a pa program mrna3927 that addresses a disease closely related to mma there is synergy in combining the natural history study for mma and pa the natural history study is a global multicenter noninterventional study for patients with confirmed diagnosis of mma due to mut deficiency or pa up to 60 mma patients and up to 60 pa patients in the united states and europe will be followed prospectively for 13 years enrollment in the study has been completed retrospective data are also being collected as available 

we have initiated an openlabel multicenter dose escalation phase 12 study of multiple ascending doses of mrna3704 in patients with isolated mma due to mut deficiency between 1 to 18 years of age with elevated plasma methylmalonic acid concentrations the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety pharmacodynamics as assessed by changes in plasma methylmalonic acid and pharmacokinetic profile of mrna3704 in patients affected by mma 

during the doseescalation phase three dose levels of mrna3704 are planned to be investigated in this study the first dose level will enroll adolescents aged 8 and older once safety and tolerability is determined we intend to enroll patients aged 1 and older an additional cohort to evaluate a fourth dose level may be considered patients will receive twelve doses of mrna3704 administered via iv infusion every 3 weeks 

three patients will be enrolled sequentially within each dose level cohort enrollment of the first three patients within each dose cohort will be staggered by 21 days using a sentinel dosing strategy approach to allow for safety observation after dosing for the evaluation of safety data prior to escalation to the next dose level a modified 33 design using predefined dose limiting toxicity criteria will be used dose escalation recommendations to open the next dose level cohort will be made by an independent smc and will include review of safety and pharmacodynamic activity through at least 21 days following the first dose administration of mrna3704 the dose limiting toxicity window for all patients 

upon establishment of a dose with acceptable safety and pharmacodynamic activity in dose escalation additional patients will be enrolled in a doseexpansion phase to allow for further characterization of the safety and pharmacodynamic activity of 

mrna3704 patients in both phases of study will enter into a predosing observational period to characterize baseline pretreatment biomarker levels followed by a treatment period and then a twoyear followup period after withdrawal of treatment a schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below we have enrolled the first patient in the trial this patient has entered an observational period prior to treatment which evaluates the patient’s baseline disease prior to starting the treatment period 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 summary 

we aim to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme complex to treat a pediatric metabolic disorder 

propionic acidemia or pa is a rare lifethreatening inherited metabolic disorder due to a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase or pcc it primarily affects the pediatric population there is no approved therapy for pa including no approved enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of the enzyme which comprises six copies each of two different subunits pcca and pccb and its mitochondrial localization the only effective treatment for severely affected individuals is liver transplant aimed at increasing enzyme activity to reduce the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic crises our platform is uniquely positioned to potentially address this disease by enabling synthesis of this complex enzyme that is localized in the mitochondria of the cell we are developing an ivadministered mrna therapeutic comprising two different mrnas encoding pcca and pccb in our proprietary lnp to replace the defective pcc enzyme with functional enzyme in liver and other cells we have received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission for the pa program the fda has also granted fast track designation to mrna3927 

 we expect to initiate a phase 12 clinical trial in pa patients 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 disease overview 

pa is an inherited metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality and no approved therapy 

pa is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder closely related to mma with significant morbidity and mortality there are approximately 3252000 pa patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0212100000 newborns and mortality rates the vast majority of patients present with lifethreatening metabolic crises during the first days or weeks of life with mortality rates ranging from 1353 during the neonatal period similar to mma the cardinal feature of the disorder is the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic decompensations that are more frequent in the first few years of life longer term sequelae include cardiac complications cardiomyopathy arrhythmias and severe neurologic complications 

the disorder is caused by a defect or deficiency in pcc an enzyme that is one step upstream in the same metabolic pathway as the mut enzyme that is deficient in mma pcc is a complex heterododecamer enzyme composed of six alpha subunits pcca and six beta subunits pccb the disorder is autosomal recessive with pa patients generally having lossoffunction mutations in either pcca or pccb and in rare instances mutations in both pcca and pccb to date over 100 mutations have been identified for both pcca and pccb genes and similar to mma most of the mutations are private also similar to mma due to this enzyme deficiency resulting in a metabolic block the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 3hydroxypropionic acid and 2methylcitrate among others and these metabolites may be used as biomarkers of disease 

there is no approved therapy for pa to treat the underlying defect including no enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of pcc and mitochondrial localization carglumic acid marketed as carbaglu is approved in the eu for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including pa management of the disorder is otherwise limited to strict dietary restrictions and other supportive measures similar to mma liver transplant is a radical yet effective treatment with the aim of increasing pcc enzyme activity in liver for severely affected individuals 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 our product concept 

we are utilizing the strength of our platform to produce a complex enzyme comprising two different proteins that localize to the mitochondria 

the ability of our platform to encode for large multimeric complexes such as pcc and enable production of intracellular mitochondrial proteins makes mrna especially suited to potentially address pa we are developing an ivadministered combination mrna approach which contains two mrnas one for each of the subunits of pcc pcca and pccb encapsulated in our proprietary lnp the intent is to potentially treat the entire pa population regardless of whether an individual has a defect or deficiency in the pcc alpha or beta subunit the mrna sequences have been engineered to improve protein translation and encode enzymaticallyactive pcc with the proper subcellular localization in the mitochondria an illustration of our approach is shown in the figure below 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated activity in a pa mouse model in a longterm repeat dose study 

a series of  in vitro  and  in vivo  pharmacology studies have been performed to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for the combined pcca and pccb mrna therapy pcca and pccb mrnas administered in pa patient fibroblasts both pcca and pccbdeficient showed production of active pcc enzyme with the proper subcellular localization in mitochondria at concentrations above wildtype levels  in vivo  studies in pa pcca   a138t mice have resulted in a dosedependent increase in hepatic pcc activity with a concomitant decrease in disease biomarkers notably a reduction in plasma ammonia levels was observed 34 weeks after a single iv administration 1 mgkg of pcca and pccb mrna encapsulated in our proprietary lnp in pa mice n45group the data are shown in panel a of the figure below additionally a 6month repeatdose study in pa mice showed decreased heart weight normalized to body weight in mice treated with monthly iv administration of pcca and pccb mrna 1 mgkg compared to control mrna n6group this is shown in panel b of the figure below data in both panels is presented as mean ± standard deviation

propionic acidemia mrna3927 clinical plan 

we are conducting a global natural history study and are planning a phase 12 clinical trial 

the clinical development plan for mrna3927 includes a global natural history study that was initiated in 2018 and a planned phase 12 study in pediatric patients diagnosed with pa 

we have launched a natural history study aimed at identifying and correlating clinical and biomarker endpoints this is a global multicenter noninterventional study for patients with confirmed diagnosis of pa or mma due to mut deficiency up to 60 pa and 60 mma patients in the united states and europe will be followed prospectively for 13 years enrollment in this study has been completed retrospective data are being collected as available

phenylketonuria mrna3283 summary 

our approach to phenylketonuria with an mrna encoding for an intracellular protein 

phenylketonuria or pku is a rare inherited metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency in the metabolism of phenylalanine or phe due to mutations within the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or pah the most effective treatment is a restrictive diet of low protein which controls phe intake approximately 2056 of pku patients respond to sapropterin dihydrochloride marketed as kuvan in the united states a synthetic bh4 cofactor for pah which improves phe metabolism but does not fully cure patients in addition biomarin has received approval for pegylated phenylalanine lyase or pal marketed as palynziq palynziq is a pegylated recombinant bacterial enzyme which metabolizes phe in the blood we believe the immune risk is at least in part driven by bacterial pal with our mrna technology cells in the human body can be instructed to produce functional pah decreasing phe levels in the blood and restoring production of tyrosine we are developing an intravenously administered mrna which encodes for the pah enzyme and is encapsulated in our proprietary lnp we plan to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial for mrna3283 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 disease overview 

there are options to treat pku which are not widely applicable and efforts by other companies are likely to face hurdles 

pku occurs in approximately 11000015000 live births in the united states   based on current population estimates that would translate into approximately 2100032000 pku patients in the united states affected individuals have a deficiency in the enzyme pah resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine thus 

pku patients suffer from a phenylalanine intoxication and a subsequent deprivation of tyrosine leading to severe mental disability if left untreated 

pah is expressed as a monomer but functions as a tetramer and requires tetrahydrobiopterin bh4 as a cofactor to complete the conversion of phe to tyrosine thereby maintaining adequate phetyr ratios within circulation to date greater than 950 gene variants have been identified in the pah gene resulting in pku 

diagnosis of pku occurs primarily through newborn screening in available countries followed by genetic confirmation newly diagnosed patients receive medical formulas containing protein with low phe content to control blood phe and provide adequate nutrition for growing infants as patients age they are tested for sensitivity to synthetic bh4 and may transition to kuvan approximately 20 of patients respond favorably to kuvan which can aid in phe control nonresponsive patients are treated mainly with restricted diet however adherence to the diet is challenging resulting in poor compliance when phe levels are not adequately controlled patients begin to show multiple signs of disease including depression anxiety poor executive function and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or adhd in may 2018 biomarin received approval to market palynziq 

one option for pku patients may be treatment with gene therapy we believe there are potential advantages for mrna therapeutics for this disorder over gene therapy as described in the systemic intracellular therapeutics modality section 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce pah intracellularly 

we believe mrna therapy is a viable therapeutic modality for pku patients due to its ability to instruct cells in the human body to produce complex functional intracellular proteins such as pah our program mrna3283 consists of an mrna encoding human pah encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the mrna sequence is optimized for protein synthesis and contains a microrna binding site to reduce or potentially eliminate synthesis of protein outside of the target tissues mrna3283 is designed to be administered intravenously to encode enzymaticallyactive pah protein in liver to restore this deficient or defective enzyme as illustrated in the figure below

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 summary 

our approach to glycogen storage disease type 1a using an mrna encoding for intracellular human glucose 6phosphatase 

glycogen storage disease type 1a gsd1a is an inherited metabolic disease caused by the deficiency in the catalytic activity of glucose 6phosphatase “g6pase” which is encoded by the glucose 6phosphatase gene “g6pc” the g6pase enzyme is involved in the metabolic pathways of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis which allow the liver and kidney to release glucose into the blood those affected by gsd1a present with lifethreatening hypoglycemia and a wide range of severe metabolic derangements and longterm complications such as hyperlipidemia lactic acidemia hepatomegaly hepatocellular adenomas and endstage renal disease the standard of care consists of strict diet control enzyme replacement therapy “ert” is not an option for these patients due to challenges associated with delivering an enzyme inside the cell strict diet control via the frequent consumption of uncooked cornstarch is effective in improving hypoglycemia however the underlying pathologies continue and its efficacy in preventing the longterm metabolic complications has yet to be established with our mrna platform cells in the liver may be instructed to produce functional g6pase with the goal of restoring the homeostasis of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways and correcting the underlying pathologies we are developing an intravenously administered mrna which encodes for g6pase and is encapsulated in our proprietary lipid nanoparticle lnp we have demonstrated activity in mouse models in the form of reduction in both liver and serum biomarkers and improvements in liver morphology we plan to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial for mrna3745 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 disease overview 

there are no approved therapies for gsd1a that address the enzymatic deficiency 

gsd1a is an inherited metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the catalytic activity of g6pase an enzyme encoded by g6pc gene and involved in two metabolic pathways associated with glucose homeostasis g6pase catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose6phosphate to glucose and inorganic phosphate the final step of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis that mainly takes place in liver and kidney gsd1a patients suffer from severe fasting hypoglycemia hepatomegaly nephromegaly lactic acidemia hypertriglyceridemia hyperuricemia hypercholesterolemia hepatic steatosis and growth retardation in addition hepatocellular adenomas occur in 70 to 80 of gsd1a patients by their third decade of life and carries risk of transformation into hepatocellular carcinomas proteinuria has been observed in over half of patients above 25 years of age 

gsd1a occurs in approximately 1100000 live births in the united states and european union but is more common in ashkenazi jews where the incidence is reported to be 120000 live births there are an estimated 2500 people in the united states and over 

4000 people in the european union with gsd1a although strict diet therapy including frequent feeding with uncooked cornstarch allows gsd1a patients to live into adulthood by preventing hypoglycemia the underlying pathological processes remain uncorrected resulting in the development of many longterm complications including liver adenomas and hepatocellular carcinoma while gene therapy is being investigated for treatment of gsd1a we believe there are potential advantages for mrna therapeutics for this disorder over gene therapy 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce g6pase intracellularly 

we believe that our platform can address gsd1a with its ability to instruct cells in the human body to produce complex functional intracellular membrane proteins such as g6pase our program mrna3745 consists of an mrna encoding for modified human g6pase encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the human g6pase sequence is modified for improved protein production and g6pase activity mrna3745 is designed to be administered intravenously and encodes g6pase protein to restore this deficient or defective enzyme as illustrated in the figure below 

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to improve hypoglycemia and other metabolic abnormalities associated with gsd1a in a mouse model 

we have conducted several in vitro and in vivo pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for gsd1a therapy mrna encoding for g6pase introduced in human cells resulted in robust production of active g6pase with subcellular localization into endoplasmic reticulum we have examined the activity of mrna encoding for human g6pase in a liverspecific g6pase  mouse model g6pclko like gsd1a patients the g6pclko mice are unable to produce endogenous glucose leading to severe hypoglycemia during the fasting state 

in a doseresponse study performed in g6pclko mice we treated the mice with three different doses of 02 05 and 1 mgkg of g6pase mrna encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and examined fasting glucose serum triglycerides and liver enzymes n58 of note mice treated with g6pase mrna showed a dosedependent improvement in fasting glycemia and a reduction in serum triglycerides without a significant increase in liver enzymes eg alanine transaminase  alt fasting blood glucose and triglycerides are shown in the figure below each bar represents the mean ± standard deviation single and double asterisk denotes p  005 and p  00001 respectively by oneway anova followed by dunnett’s posthoc test for multiple comparisons 

serum biomarkers after single dose of g6pase mrna in g6pclko mice 

in the same study a reduction in liver weight compared to the controltreated group was observed after 24 hours of administration of g6pase encoded mrna in lnp the reduction in liver weight was associated with significant improvement in liver morphology presumably due to reduction in liver glucose 6phosphate glycogen and triglycerides 

reduction in liver weight 24 hours after iv administration of g6pase mrna in g6pclko mice 

in addition data for a 7week repeatdose study in g6pclko mice receiving g6pase mrna in lnp at 025 mgkg iv every other week have shown a pronounced improvement in fasting glycemia in comparison with the g6pclko mice receiving a control mrna treatment as shown below n79

glycogen storage disease type 1a mrna3745 clinical plan 

we are planning a phase 1 clinical trial 

we plan to conduct an openlabel dose escalation phase 1 study of mrna3745 in adolescent and adult patients with gsd1a in the united states the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna3745 to assess the pharmacodynamic response through changes in maintenance of euglycemia and to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of mrna3745 

manufacturing product supply and technical development 

we believe manufacturing plays a critical role in our value chain and ability to develop a new class of medicines our manufacturing capabilities currently support the research engine and the early development engine while in connection with preparing for our upcoming phase 3 clinical trial with our cmv vaccine we are establishing capabilities to support the late stage development and commercial engine within the research engine our manufacturing provides mrna drug substance and formulated drug product for platform research and therapeutic area drug discovery for the early development engine we manufacture mrna and drug product for indenabling glp toxicology studies and initial human clinical studies for late stage development we manufacture mrna and drug product for phase 3 studies our approach to date has been to proactively build capacity in anticipation of demand from internal research and development as well as from our strategic collaborators we have done so by making significant investments in our internal manufacturing capability and in a network of external manufacturing partners 

overview of our manufacturing operating model 

our manufacturing activities focus on the following 

 we have invested in a dedicated inhouse manufacturing facility in norwood ma moderna technology center mtc given our expectations for significant ongoing pipeline expansion and the long lead time required in building manufacturing infrastructure the facility is approximately 200000 square feet can scale up to 100 cgmp lots per year and can accommodate over 200 of our employees this facility is expected to support our research engine supply indenabling glp toxicology study supplies our phase 1 and phase 2 pipeline activities laterstage clinical development activities particularly in connection with our phase 3 cmv vaccine clinical trials as well as certain commercial activities 

the mtc includes the following areas 

 the facility has been designed with a high level of automation and digital integration of manufacturing records and data in addition we have deployed an automated material and resource management system a manufacturing execution system a laboratory execution system a laboratory information management system and an asset and document management system to ensure the digital integration of our manufacturing product testing and release and regulatory filings 

manufacturing technology development 

in order to support our broad pipeline of products spanning multiple therapeutic areas and multiple routes of administration the technology underpinning product manufacturing is critical to our success over the last few years we have invested heavily in this technology to enable the breadth and depth of our pipeline and to prepare us to meet future needs and requirements as our programs enter later phases of development and commercialization 

our technology efforts are intended to span the development of robust and consistent manufacturing processes assays to fully characterize the product and fitforpurpose formulations and product presentations in addition manufacturing activities include the development of novel hardware platforms that incorporate significant automation and robotics which are applicable broadly across programs but also specifically to personalized cancer vaccines all of these activities are being developed with a focus on achieving appropriate cost of goods and scalability 

our advances over the last few years have enabled us to more efficiently scale our mrna and drug product manufacturing at successfully larger production yields we have made significant investments in analytical characterization to determine critical product quality attributes and enable manufacturing site and scale changes over the course of development in addition pharmaceutical readiness of our drug product has enabled a wide variety of routes of administration eg intramuscular intratumoral and intravenous 

we have also invested in the establishment of technology for the manufacture of some of our key raw materials including dna plasmid and many small molecules this vertical integration allows us to exert significant control over the value chain though we will continue to use a combination of internal and external manufacture of these raw materials 

supply of mrna for the research engine and early development engine 

supply for the research engine 

we believe that our internal manufacturing capacity is key to the advancement of our platform technology development and therapeutic area discovery efforts high throughput automation and customengineered equipment enable us to produce multiple high quality mrna and formulated constructs within a limited timeframe from order to delivery we currently have infrastructure capable of producing up to 1000 lots of mrna sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks from sequence to final product the typical scale of mrna manufactured by this team is 11000 mg 

supply for the early development engine 

analogous to the research engine we have proactively established manufacturing capabilities for the early development engine we started supplying product to enable indenabling glp toxicology studies and for human clinical studies meeting required cgmp standards with a combination of internal manufacturing at our cambridge headquarters and external manufacturing at wellestablished contract manufacturing organizations or cmos our mtc facility has the capability and capacity to produce research and clinical supply for our programs as well as to enable technology development and scaleup for future needs we will continue to selectively use cmos to complement our internal capacity to provide supply contingency and expanded capability where needed 

this extensive capacity has helped enable our broad pipeline of 24  development candidates including the significant output necessary to supply our toxicological and human clinical studies though the underpinnings of the technology utilized across these 23  programs are the same each program typically requires customization driven in part by its target product profile these custom features range from varying molecular architecture to different routes of administration and often necessitate multivalent products for example our cmv vaccine mrna1647 requires six different mrna sequences to be manufactured for inclusion in an intramuscular mrna medicine whereas ox40l mrna2416 requires a single mrna sequence for inclusion in an intratumoral mrna medicine all programs with the exception of pcv require that we scale up supply over time to meet the clinical demand required in the different phases of development and prepare the process for regulatory approval and eventually commercial supply where bigger batch sizes will be required in contrast the pcv program is designed to provide each patient with a cancer vaccine that is designed and manufactured for that specific patient thus increasing the number of batches to match the number of patients treated as we scale the manufacturing output for particular programs we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates from indenabling glp toxicology studies through commercial launch including improvement to shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance typically after a change in process more time may be required for pharmaceutical property testing such as 6 or 12month stability testing this time lag may necessitate resupplying clinical materials or making additional cgmp batches to meet clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed 

supply of mrna and formulated product for toxicology studies  early on we established the internal capability to produce mrna and formulated product for indenabling glp toxicology studies for our development candidates under glp standards 

supply of cgmp mrna and formulated product for human clinical studies  we have incrementally built the capability to produce and supply mrna drug product for clinical development in our early years we outsourced cgmp supply we selected specialized cmos to support a total of five programs by the end of 2015 in 2016 we built and qualified two cgmp suites in our cambridge facility for the manufacture of mrna drug substance and formulated drug product while we had the internal capability to produce drug product we continued to work with our external cmo network for redundant capacity and to provide sterile filling capability 

cgmp manufacture of pcv  due to the specialized nature of personalized medicine in which a batch is specifically manufactured for a single patient the pcv program has unique requirements in this program we digitally integrate patientspecific data from 

sequencing tumor samples and automatically design pcvs for patients we have developed proprietary bioinformatics design algorithms and have linked them to an automated manufacturing process for rapid production of formulated mrna that can be turned around in a matter of weeks the pcv manufacturing capability is termed personalized vaccine unit or pvu pcv manufacturing is conducted using custom automated and engineering solutions utilizing singleuse systems with fast “needletoneedle” turnaround time we have operationalized pcv manufacture within our external cmo network to meet our phase 1 supply needs while in parallel working to internalize manufacturing unlike traditional process development where the product is scaled up in quantity for later phases of development and commercialization each pcv is manufactured for a single patient and thus scaledout with extensive use of automation and robotics for the larger numbers of patients involved in later phases of development and commercialization 

supply for the late stage development and commercialization engine 

as our pipeline advances to later stage development and potential commercialization we will need to evolve our manufacturing suites and other capabilities at our mtc facility the modular nature of the mtc suites is permitting us to manufacture drug substance and drug product for our upcoming phase 3 cmv clinical trial and potentially other registrational trials and potentially drug substance and drug product for commercialization for certain rare disease indications in other instances we may build additional capabilities to support our late stage development and commercialization engine 

quality unit 

quality is core to the way we operate we seek to ensure quality at moderna through a combination of a robust quality management system or qms our quality culture and through our people in accordance with applicable regulations we have established documented and implemented a qms to assure continued compliance with the requirements therein the qms facilitates cgmp compliance by implementing practices that identify the various processes required by the qms their application throughout the organization and the sequence of interaction of these processes 

the primary mode of documenting these key practices is through policies standard operating procedures forms and other quality records which include an overarching quality policy and quality manual we have implemented measurement tools and metrics to monitor measure and analyze these practices to support cgmp operations achieve planned results and support continuous improvement we monitor these quality metrics through formal governance processes including quality management review or qmr and our quality council to enable continuous improvement we have also established an independent quality unit that fulfills quality assurance and quality control responsibilities 

while the quality unit is ultimately accountable and responsible for quality quality is everyone’s responsibility all cgmp personnel are empowered to ensure quality systems are appropriately maintained and executed 

we have established a culture that encourages transparency accountability and ownership of quality at all levels in the organization as we scale the quality organization we have focused on hiring the best talent with the required experience training and education 

supply chain unit 

we have established a robust supply chain to enable sufficient supply of the raw materials used to produce our mrnas and components of our formulations we have worked with our supply chain vendors to characterize critical raw materials and to understand their impact on the quality of mrna drug substance and formulated drug product we have also assessed the quality system and performance of our supply chain vendors and worked with them to comply with regulatory requirements 

digital infrastructure 

we believe that digital technologies such as robotics automation artificial intelligence and cloud computing are critical to operationalize our strategy accelerate our pace of learning and execute at scale our approach to bring these digital technologies into our workflows and processes has involved the following 

 we have seen several benefits from our investments in digitization most importantly through the depth of our platform technology and breadth of our pipeline other benefits include 

 our digital building blocks 

we utilize six building blocks for our digital infrastructure 

 digital technologies to enable our research engine 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies across our research engine to drive a rapid pace of learning enable efficient workflows and business processes and draw insights from vast amounts of data our aim is to provide our platform and discovery scientists with access to an environment that helps them through each step of their research cycle 

drug design studio  our proprietary inhouse digital application suite contains a sequence designer module to tailor an entire mrna with everimproving rule sets that contain our accumulated learning about mrna design drug design studio utilizes cloudbased computational capacity to run various algorithms we have developed to design each mrna sequence the utility of cloudbased capacity allows us to provide flexible computational capacity on demand allowing the research engine to power parallel intake and design of multiple mrna sequences once a sequence is designed it can be ordered digitally using an internal order form application within drug design studio 

manufacture of research grade mrna  once an order is optimized the mrna production process is triggered we have developed proprietary interfaces that allow the manufacturing team to track production orders at every stage we have automated several manufacturing steps using both offtheshelf and custom automation the equipment used in the manufacture of researchgrade mrna is integrated with the digital interfaces to capture extract and interpret the data generated at each step of the manufacturing process building digital traceability on each mrna order we have also embedded realtime algorithms and analytics tools to allow for automated decisionmaking at some stages accelerate the quality control workflows and provide for continuous improvement of manufacturing processes 

dispatching and shipping mrna  because we produce large quantities of researchgrade mrna we require digital tools to track their shipment to our scientists and to external contract research organizations or cros conducting  in vivo  studies our dispatching and shipping application automatically generates barcoded labels allowing for traceability of product 

inventory and registry  material used in research and created in production including mrna cell lines chemicals and reagents is tracked in our inventory application this application supports numerous workflow tools such as consumption aliquoting material transfer and stock alerts critical material types are assigned unique registry identification by our registry application 

study design  using our drug design studio our scientists can design their  in vivo  studies using our proprietary study design application this application captures  in vivo  study protocol design parameters including dose amount number of doses frequency samples and assays for each sample this application serves two purposes it allows our scientists to maintain and track their  in vivo  study designs and associated research grade mrna our study design application also allows our  in vivo  pharmacology teams to track the various ongoing studies and leverage external cros to manage the  in vivo  demand as needed 

experiment management  we have deployed electronic lab notebooks for experiment management allowing our scientists to streamline documentation of their experiments and track it in a standardized searchable repository we have also integrated electronic lab notebooks further with our other research tools to connect inventory  in vivo  studies and instrument data 

advanced analytics and ai to accelerate the pace of learning  we utilize ai to enable various parts of our platform and drug discovery examples include 

 digital technologies to enable our early development engine 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies across our early development engine to drive the rapid pace of advancement in parallel of our development candidates into the clinic 

digital systems for cgmp manufacture  we are committed to having integrated systems connected with robotics to drive our manufacturing in a paperless environment and have designed and deployed automation to drive efficient manufacturing operations we have also deployed digital tools within manufacturing process development that give us the ability to track analyze and rapidly deploy manufacturing process improvements additionally we have implemented several digital systems across manufacturing process development quality supply chain and operations including 



 digital systems for clinical development and clinical operations  in order to track the timelines of various development candidates through the early development engine we have created a set of integrated applications workflows include timelines for regulatory filings planning for indenabling glp toxicology studies scheduling for cgmp manufacturing and clinical operations management below is a summary of our applications 

 digital systems for pcv  the pcv program aims to design manufacture and deliver a drug product that includes an mrna sequence encoding for each patient’s specific neoantigens the personalized nature of the pcv program adds additional steps and complexity in the overall patient treatment process we have addressed those additional steps and complexity by digitizing and automating steps within the process as described below 

 digital technologies to support our business processes 

we have deployed several digital systems across finance manufacturing and human resources to automate our business processes and drive efficiencies we have implemented the sap s4hana system for erp in december 2016 we implemented the finance procurement and inventory management modules and further scaled the erp to support manufacturing quality and supply chain in september 2017 and added the mtc facility and processes in july 2018 we have implemented various cloudbased solutions to improve business processes and drive efficiencies for example we have implemented the workday system for human resource planning and management and integrated various applications across payroll 401k services equity plan management and expense reporting 

thirdparty strategic alliances 

strategic alliances 

to accelerate the discovery and advancement of potential mrna medicines across therapeutic areas we have entered into and intend to seek other opportunities to form alliances with a diverse group of strategic collaborators we have forged productive strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies government agencies academic laboratories foundations and research institutes with therapeutic area expertise and resources in an effort to advance our discovery and development programs while leveraging our platform and our research and early development engines 

one key principle of our approach to strategic alliances is to share the rewards and risks of developing a new mrna modality where we may have early research data and desire a strategic collaborator to join us in advancing early development candidates within such modality into the clinic representative relationships and associated programs include the following 

 we view strategic alliances as important drivers for accelerating execution of our goal of rapidly developing mrna medicines to treat patients across a wide range of medical and disease challenges to maintain the integrity of our platform the terms of our agreements with our strategic collaborators generally provide that our strategic collaborators receive rights to develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines that we design and manufacture as opposed to rights to use our platform to generate new mrna and that we generally own mrnarelated intellectual property arising from research activities performed under the strategic alliance 

we plan to continue to identify potential strategic collaborators who can contribute meaningful resources and insights to our programs and allow us to more rapidly expand our impact to broader patient populations 

astrazeneca nyse azn—strategic alliances in cardiovascular and oncology 

we have three alliances with astrazeneca our first strategic alliance established in 2013 and amended and restated in 2018 was to discover develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases as well as selected targets for cancer the relationship with astrazeneca was expanded in 2016 by entering into a new immunooncology strategic alliance which is now focused on the joint development of an mrna investigational medicine to make the il12 protein it was further expanded in 2017 by entering into another strategic alliance which is focused on the joint development of a potential mrna medicine to make the relaxin protein following discovery and preclinical development of the relevant development candidate internally additionally astrazeneca has made several equity investments in moderna which total approximately 2900 million through december 31 2019  

2013 agreements with astrazeneca amended and restated in 2018 

in march 2013 we entered into an option agreement and a related services and collaboration agreement with astrazeneca which were amended and restated in june 2018 we refer to these amended and restated agreements as the 2018 ar agreements under the 

2018 ar agreements we granted astrazeneca certain exclusive rights and licenses to research develop and commercialize potential therapeutic mrna medicines directed at certain targets for the treatment of cardiovascular and cardiometabolic diseases and cancer and agreed to provide related services to astrazeneca the activities to be performed by the parties under the 2018 ar agreements are limited to defined biological targets in the cardiovascular and cardiometabolic fields and one defined target in the cancer field 

pursuant to the 2018 ar agreements astrazeneca is responsible for all research development and commercialization activities and associated costs while we provide specified research and manufacturing services at astrazeneca’s expense during a research and evaluation period as described below to further astrazeneca’s activities conducted pursuant to an agreed upon services plan astrazeneca may request we provide additional services at astrazeneca’s expense subject to customary “backup” supply rights granted to astrazeneca we exclusively manufacture or have manufactured mrna for all research development and commercialization purposes under the 2018 ar agreements until on a productbyproduct basis the expiration of the time period for which we are entitled to receive earnout payments with respect to such product pursuant to the 2018 ar agreements 

as of the effective date of the original option agreement and services and collaboration agreement in 2013 and as further reflected in the 2018 ar agreements astrazeneca acquired forty options that it may exercise to obtain exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize identified development candidates and related backup candidates directed to specified targets that arise during the research and evaluation period during the research and evaluation period for research candidates astrazeneca may elect to designate a limited number of research candidates as development candidates in order to continue preclinical development on such development candidates and related backup candidates from such pool of development candidates designated by astrazeneca during a specified option exercise period astrazeneca may then exercise one of its options to obtain exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize an identified development candidate and related backup candidates in certain fields if astrazeneca does not exercise one of its options to acquire exclusive rights to clinically develop and commercialize a particular development candidate during the defined option exercise period for such development candidate astrazeneca’s rights to exercise an option and other rights granted under the 2018 ar agreements with respect to such development candidate and related backup candidates will terminate all rights to exploit such development candidate and related backup candidates will be returned to us and all data and results generated by astrazeneca with respect to such development candidate and related backup candidates will be either assigned or licensed to us upon the earlier of termination of the 2018 ar agreements for any reason and a specified anniversary of the effective date of the original option agreement and services and collaboration agreement in 2013 all unexercised options and the right to exercise any and all options if not previously exercised by astrazeneca will automatically terminate 

on a targetbytarget basis we and astrazeneca have agreed to certain defined exclusivity obligations under the 2018 ar agreements with respect to the research development and commercialization of mrna medicines for such target in certain fields in addition we and astrazeneca have agreed to certain defined exclusivity obligations with respect to the research development and commercialization of mrna medicines coding for the same polypeptide as any development candidate being developed under the 2018 ar agreements 

as of the effective date of the original option agreement and services and collaboration agreement in 2013 astrazeneca made upfront cash payments to us totaling 2400 million in exchange for the acquired options and our performance of certain researchrelated services each as described above astrazeneca will pay us a 100 million option exercise payment with respect to each development candidate and related backup candidates for which it exercises an option we are also eligible to receive on a productbyproduct basis up to 4000 million in aggregate contingent option exercise payments upon the achievement of certain development regulatory and commercial milestone events additionally we are entitled to receive on a productbyproduct basis earnout payments on worldwide net sales of products ranging from a highsingle digit percentage to 12 subject to certain reductions with an aggregate minimum floor as of december 31 2019  we have received from astrazeneca an option exercise payment of 100 million and a clinical milestone payment of 300 million with respect to astrazeneca’s vegfa product azd8601 that is currently being developed in a phase 2a clinical trial in the cardiovascular and cardiometabolic fields additionally as of december 31 2019  we have received 1200 million from astrazeneca under the 2018 ar agreements for the achievement of specified technical milestones 

unless earlier terminated the 2018 ar agreements will continue until the expiration of astrazeneca’s earnout and contingent option exercise payment obligations for optioned product candidates either party may terminate the 2018 ar agreements upon the other party’s material breach either in its entirety or in certain circumstances with respect to relevant candidates subject to a defined materiality threshold and specified notice and cure provisions if astrazeneca has the right to terminate the 2018 ar agreements for our material breach then astrazeneca may elect in lieu of terminating the 2018 ar agreements in their entirety or with respect to such candidates to have the 2018 ar agreements remain in effect subject to reductions in certain payments we are eligible to receive and certain adjustments to astrazeneca’s obligations under the 2018 ar agreements astrazeneca may terminate the 2018 ar agreements in full without cause upon 90 days’ prior notice to us 

2016 strategic alliance with astrazeneca—il12

inlicensed intellectual property 

while we develop and manufacture our potential mrna medicines using our internally created mrna technology platform we also seek out and evaluate third party technologies and ip that may be complementary to our platform 

patent sublicense agreements with cellscript and mrna ribotherapeutics 

the trustees of the university of pennsylvania or penn owns several issued us patents granted european patents and pending us patent applications directed in part to nucleosidemodified mrnas and their uses or the penn modified mrna patents mrna ribotherapeutics inc or mrt obtained an exclusive license to the penn modified mrna patents and granted its affiliate cellscript llc or cellscript a sublicense to the penn modified mrna patents in certain fields of use 

in june 2017 we entered into two sublicense agreements one with cellscript and one with mrt which agreements we collectively refer to as the cellscriptmrt agreements together the cellscriptmrt agreements grant us a worldwide sublicensable sublicense to the penn modified mrna patents to research develop make and commercialize products covered by the penn modified mrna patents or licensed products for all  in vivo  uses in humans and animals including therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic applications the cellscriptmrt agreements are nonexclusive although cellscript and mrt are subject to certain time restrictions on granting additional sublicenses for  in vivo  uses in humans under the penn modified mrna patents 

we paid cellscript and mrt aggregate sublicense grant fees of 28 million upon entering into the cellscriptmrt agreements 25 million in early 2018 and 22 million in early 2019 cellscript and mrt are collectively eligible to receive on a licensed productbylicensed product basis milestone payments totaling up to 05 million upon the achievement of certain regulatorybased events for diagnostic products and milestone payments totaling up to 15 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatorybased events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products and up to 24 million upon the achievement of certain commercialbased events for either therapeutic or prophylactic products the cellscriptmrt agreements require us to pay royalties 

based on annual net sales of licensed products at rates in the low single digits for therapeutic prophylactic and diagnostic uses and royalties based on annual net sales of licensed products sold for research uses at rates in the midsingle digits subject to certain reductions with an aggregate minimum floor following the first commercial sale of licensed products under a cellscriptmrt agreement we are required to pay cellscript or mrt as applicable minimum annual royalties ranging from 10000—400000 depending on the use of such licensed product with all such payments creditable against earned royalties on net sales 

the cellscriptmrt agreements will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire or become abandoned of the penn modified mrna patents cellscript or mrt as applicable may terminate its respective cellscriptmrt agreement if we fail to make required payments or otherwise materially breach the applicable agreement subject to specified notice and cure provisions cellscript or mrt as applicable may also terminate the applicable cellscriptmrt agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the penn modified mrna patents we have the right to terminate each cellscriptmrt agreement at will upon 60 days’ prior notice to cellscript or mrt as applicable provided that we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products upon such termination if rights to mrt or cellscript under the penn modified mrna patents are terminated eg due to bankruptcy of mrt or cellscript the terminated party will assign its interest in the respective cellscriptmrt agreement to the licensor from which it received rights under the penn modified mrna patents and our rights will continue under the new licensor 

formulation technology inlicenses 

our development candidates use internally developed formulation technology that we own we do however have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents covering formulation technologies under licenses from other entities if in the future we elect to use or to grant our strategic collaborators sublicenses to use these inlicensed formulation technologies we or our strategic collaborators may be liable for milestone and royalty payment obligations arising from such use we consider the commercial terms of these licenses and their provisions regarding diligence insurance indemnification and other similar matters to be reasonable and customary for our industry 

in addition we have entered into material transfer agreements that have provided us with opportunities to evaluate third party delivery systems 

employees 

we have approximately 830  fulltime employees 51 of whom hold phd md jd or master’s degrees among our employees 45 identify as female 54 identify as male and 1 have chosen not to identify themselves or selected other none of our employees is represented by a labor union and none of our employees has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us we consider our employee relations to be good 

we believe that our employees are highly engaged and we and our employees have been recognized by surveys conducted by external groups science magazine ranked us as a top employer for the last five years we were ranked 7 in 2015 3 in 2016 6 in 2017 4 in 2018 and 11 in 2019 

our approach to attracting and retaining talent within moderna

corporate social responsibility 

in pursuit of our mission to deliver on the promise of mrna science to create a new generation of transformative medicines for patients we have scaled our operations invested in research and hired toptier talent as we continue to mature we believe it is important to develop longterm programs that underscore our commitment to corporate social responsibility please refer to the “citizenship” section of our website which can be found at wwwmodernatxcom for a description of some of the measures we have taken to support our commitment to corporate social responsibility 

competition 

the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition there is also a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products 

we believe that mrna as a medicine coupled with our capabilities across mrna technology drug discovery development and manufacturing provide us with a competitive advantage however we will continue to face competition from different sources including major pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies academic institutions government agencies and public and private research institutions for any products that we eventually commercialize we will not only compete with existing therapies but also compete with new therapies that may become available in the future 

we compete in the segment of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries there are additional companies that are working on potential mrna medicines companies with clinical programs with mrna include biontech curevac etherna immunotherapies and translate bio and those with preclinical programs include arcturus therapeutics ethris genevant sciences stemirna therapeutics and glaxosmithkline 

government regulation 

government authorities in the united states at the federal state and local level and in other countries regulate among other things the research development testing manufacture quality control approval labeling packaging storage recordkeeping promotion advertising distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting marketing and export and import of drug and biological products such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines generally before a new drug or biologic can be marketed considerable data demonstrating its quality safety and efficacy must be obtained organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority 

us drug and biological product development 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdca and its implementing regulations and biologics under the fdca the public health service act or phsa and their implementing regulations both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal state and local statutes and regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions these sanctions could include among other actions the fda’s refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval license revocation a clinical hold untitled or warning letters voluntary or mandatory product recalls market withdrawals product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines must be approved by the fda through a biologics license application or bla or new drug application nda process before they may be legally marketed in the united states the process generally involves the following 



 the preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines will be granted on a timely basis or at all 

preclinical studies 

before testing any biological or drug candidate including our product candidates in humans the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation as well as  in vitro  and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use the conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements including glp regulations for safetytoxicology studies an ind sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests together with manufacturing information analytical data any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies among other things to the fda as part of an ind an ind is a request for authorization from the fda to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin some longterm preclinical testing may continue after the ind is submitted an ind automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold in such a case the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin as a result submission of an ind may not result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence 

clinical trials 

the clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control in accordance with gcp requirements which include the requirement that all patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the clinical trial dosing procedures subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy each protocol and any subsequent amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind furthermore each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an irb for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits the irb also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed there also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries information about certain clinical trials including clinical trial results must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the wwwclinicaltrialsgov website 

in addition to the submission of an ind to the fda before initiation of a clinical trial in the united states certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules had historically been subject to review by the recombinant dna advisory committee or rac of the national institutes of health or nih office of biotechnology activities or the oba pursuant to the nih guidelines for research involving recombinant dna molecules or nih guidelines on august 17 2018 the nih issued a notice in the federal register and issued a public statement proposing changes to the oversight framework for gene therapy trials including changes to the applicable nih guidelines to modify the roles and responsibilities of the rac with respect to human clinical trials of gene therapy products and requesting public comment on its proposed modifications during the public comment period which closed october 16 2018 the nih announced that it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for review as a part of the protocol registration process or convene the rac to review individual clinical protocols in april 2019 nih announced the updated guidelines which reflect these proposed changes and clarified that these trials will remain subject to the fda’s oversight and other clinical trial regulations and oversight at the local level will continue as set forth in the nih guidelines specifically under the nih guidelines supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an institutional biosafety committee or ibc a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution the ibc assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial while the nih guidelines are not mandatory unless the 

research in question being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving nih funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the nih guidelines voluntarily follow them 

a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the united states may but need not obtain fda authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an ind if a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an ind the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the fda in support of a bla or nda the fda will accept a welldesigned and wellconducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind if the study was conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the fda is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary 

clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases known as phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 and may overlap 

 in august 2018 the fda released a draft guidance entitled “expansion cohorts use in firstinhuman clinical trials to expedite development of oncology drugs and biologics” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development ie the firstinhuman clinical trial to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in ind applications and assessed by fda expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time 

postapproval trials sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval these trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting in certain instances the fda may mandate the performance of phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a bla or nda 

progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials among other information must be submitted at least annually to the fda and written ind safety reports must be submitted to the fda and the investigators 15 calendar days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events findings from other studies or animal or  in vitro  testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure the sponsor also must notify the fda of any unexpected fatal or lifethreatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information 

phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period if at all the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients additionally some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor known as a data safety monitoring board or committee this group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial concurrent with clinical trials companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and among other things companies must develop methods for testing the identity strength quality and purity of the final product additionally appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life 

fda review process 

following completion of the clinical trials data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the fda as part of a bla or 

nda along with proposed labeling chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data a bla is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety purity and potency an nda for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy the marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings data may come from companysponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources including studies initiated by investigators to support marketing approval the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the fda fda approval of a bla or nda must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the united states 

under the prescription drug user fee act or pdufa as amended each bla or nda must be accompanied by a user fee the fda adjusts the pdufa user fees on an annual basis fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business additionally no user fees are assessed on blas or ndas for products designated as orphan drugs unless the product also includes a nonorphan indication 

the fda reviews all submitted blas and ndas before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the bla or nda for filing the fda must make a decision on accepting a bla or nda for filing within 60 days of receipt and such decision could include a refusal to file by the fda once the submission is accepted for filing the fda begins an indepth review of the bla or nda under the goals and policies agreed to by the fda under pdufa the fda has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original bla or nda for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant and six months from the filing date of an original bla or nda designated for priority review the fda does not always meet its pdufa goal dates for standard and priority blas and ndas and the review process is often extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 

before approving a bla or nda the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cgmp requirements the fda will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cgmp requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications 

the fda also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with gcp requirements additionally the fda may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions if any the fda is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval the fda likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data which could result in extensive discussions between the fda and the applicant during the review process after the fda evaluates a bla or nda it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic or drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications a complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form a complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the bla or nda identified by the fda the complete response letter may require additional clinical data additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trials andor other significant and timeconsuming requirements related to clinical trials preclinical studies or manufacturing if a complete response letter is issued the applicant may either resubmit the bla or nda addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing even if such data and information are submitted the fda may decide that the bla or nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data 

orphan drug designation 

under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200000 individuals in the united states or more than 200000 individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the united states for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product 

orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a bla or nda after the fda grants orphan drug designation the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 

if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues competitors however may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication in the latter case because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for offlabel uses the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite 

our orphan exclusivity orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same drug and same indication as defined by the fda for which we are seeking approval or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease if we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity orphan drug status in the european union or eu has similar but not identical requirements and benefits 

expedited development and review programs 

the fda has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria specifically new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied the sponsor can request the fda to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving bla or nda approval but ideally no later than the prebla or prenda meeting any product submitted to the fda for marketing including under a fast track program may be eligible for other types of fda programs intended to expedite development and review such as priority review and accelerated approval any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies the fda will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review 

a product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies in addition it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality or imm that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on imm or other clinical benefit as a condition of approval the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and wellcontrolled postmarketing clinical trials if the fda concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted it will require such postmarketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product if the fda determines that the conditions of approval are not being met the fda can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic 

additionally a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation plus intensive guidance from the fda to ensure an efficient drug development program 

even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs the fda may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for fda review or approval may not be shortened furthermore fast track designation priority review accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process 

pediatric information 

under the pediatric research equity act as amended a bla or nda or supplement to a bla or nda must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective the fda may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient new indication new dosage form new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial pediatric study plan or psp within 60 days of an endofphase 2 meeting or if there is no such meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 23 study the initial psp must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct including study objectives and design age groups relevant endpoints and statistical approach or a justification for not including such detailed information and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information the fda and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the psp a sponsor can submit amendments to an agreedupon initial psp at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies early phase clinical trials andor other clinical development programs 

postmarketing requirements 

following approval of a new product the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including among other things monitoring and recordkeeping activities reporting of adverse experiences complying with promotion and advertising requirements which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations known as ‘‘offlabel use’’ and limitations on industrysponsored scientific and educational activities although physicians may prescribe legally available products for offlabel uses manufacturers may not market or promote such uses prescription drug and biologic 

promotional materials must be submitted to the fda in conjunction with their first use further if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic including changes in indications labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities the applicant may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new bla or nda or bla or nda supplement which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials 

the fda may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems to assure the safe use of the product if the fda concludes a rems is needed the sponsor of the bla or nda must submit a proposed rems the fda will not approve the bla or nda without an approved rems if required a rems could include medication guides physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use such as restricted distribution methods patient registries and other risk minimization tools any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion distribution prescription or dispensing of products newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures including a rems or the conduct of postmarketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue product approvals may be withdrawn for noncompliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 

fda regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cgmp regulations in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of certain clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cgmp regulations we and these manufacturers must comply with cgmp regulations that require among other things quality control and quality assurance the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cgmp manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp requirements and other laws accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance the discovery of violative conditions including failure to conform to cgmp regulations could result in enforcement actions and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product manufacturer or holder of an approved bla or nda including recall 

us patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 

depending upon the timing duration and specifics of fda approval of our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly referred to as the hatch waxman amendments the hatch waxman amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and fda regulatory review process patent term restoration however cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of a bla or nda plus the time between the submission date of a bla or nda and the approval of that application except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent the uspto in consultation with the fda reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in the future we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the current expiration date depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant bla or nda 

marketing exclusivity provisions under the fdca can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications the fdca provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an nda or supplement to an existing nda if new clinical investigations other than bioavailability studies that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the fda to be essential to the approval of the application for example for new indications dosages or strengths of an existing drug this threeyear exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the fda from approving abbreviated new drug applications or andas for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use the fdca also provides a fiveyear period of nonpatent marketing exclusivity within the united states to the first applicant to obtain approval of an nda for a new chemical entity a drug is a new chemical entity if the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance 

during the exclusivity period the fda may not accept for review an anda or a 505b2 nda submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval however an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement to one of the patents listed with the fda by the innovator nda holder threeyear and fiveyear exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full nda however an applicant submitting a full nda would be required to conduct or obtain 

a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy 

an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdalicensed reference biological product was created by the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 or bpci act this amendment to the phsa in part attempts to minimize duplicative testing biosimilarity which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety purity and potency can be shown through analytical studies animal studies and a clinical trial or trials interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and for products administered multiple times to an individual that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch 

a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the fda will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product ‘‘first licensure’’ typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the united states date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of and a new period of exclusivity is not available for a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product or licensor predecessor in interest or other related entity for a change not including a modification to the structure of the biological product that results in a new indication route of administration dosing schedule dosage form delivery system delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety purity or potency 

pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the united states pediatric exclusivity if granted adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods this six month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an fda issued ‘‘written request’’ for such a trial 

european union drug development 

in the eu our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements as in the united states medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained 

similar to the united states the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the european union are subject to significant regulatory controls although the eu clinical trials directive 200120ec has sought to harmonize the eu clinical trials regulatory framework setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the eu the eu member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the directive differently this has led to significant variations in the member state regimes under the current regime before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the eu countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies the national competent authority or nca and one or more ethics committees or ecs under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the nca and ecs of the member state where they occurred 

the eu clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization simplifying adverse event reporting procedures improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency in april 2014 the eu adopted a new clinical trials regulation eu no 5362014 which is set to replace the current clinical trials directive 200120ec it is expected that the new clinical trials regulation eu no 5362014 will apply following confirmation of full functionality of the clinical trials information system ctis the centralized eu portal and database for clinical trials foreseen by the regulation through an independent audit the regulation becomes applicable six months after the european commission publishes notice of this confirmation it will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical studies in the eu specifically the new regulation which will be directly applicable in all member states and so does not require national implementing legislation in each member state aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical studies in the eu for instance the new clinical trials regulation provides for a streamlined application procedure via a single point and strictly defined deadlines for the assessment of clinical study applications 

pediatric investigation plan 

an application for marketing authorization of a medicinal product for human use which is not yet authorized in the eu shall be considered valid only if it includes a pediatric investigational plan or pip according to regulation ec no 19012006 the pip or the application for waiver shall be submitted with a request for agreement except in duly justified cases early during the product development phase and not later than upon completion of the human pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects the end of phase 1 

pharmacokinetic studies can coincide with the initial tolerability studies or the initiation of the adult phase 2 studies proofofconcept studies in any case submission of the pip cannot be after initiation of pivotal trials or confirmatory phase 3 trials 

the pediatric committee a scientific committee established at the community level shall assess the content of any pip waivers and deferrals for a medicinal product submitted to it in accordance with the regulation on medicinal products for pediatric use and formulate an opinion thereon 

european union drug review and approval 

in the european economic area or eea which is comprised of the 27 member states of the eu and norway iceland and liechtenstein medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization or ma there are two types of marketing authorizations 

the community ma is issued by the european commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the committee for medicinal products for human use or chmp of the ema and is valid throughout the entire territory of the eea the centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as biotechnology medicinal products orphan medicinal products advanced therapy medicines such as gene therapy somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of hiv aids cancer neurodegenerative disorders diabetes autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases for those products for which the use of the centralized procedure is not mandatory applicants may elect to use the centralized procedure where either the product contains a new active substance not yet authorized in the eea or where the applicant can show that the product constitutes a significant therapeutic scientific or technical innovation or for which the centralized procedure is in the interest of patients at a european level 

national mas which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the eea and only cover their respective territory are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the eea this national ma can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure if the product has not received a national ma in any member state at the time of application it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the ma is sought one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state or rms the competent authority of the rms prepares a draft assessment report a draft summary of the product characteristics or spc and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet which are sent to the other member states referred to as the concerned member states for their approval if the concerned member states raise no objections based on a potential serious risk to public health in relation to the assessment spc labeling or packaging proposed by the rms the product is subsequently granted a national ma in all the member states ie in the rms and the concerned member states 

under the above described procedures before granting the ma the ema or the competent authorities of the member states of the eea make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality safety and efficacy 

european union exclusivity 

in the eu new innovative products authorized for marketing ie reference products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon the grant of a marketing authorization during the period of data exclusivity regulatory authorities in the eu may not reference the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application for eight years after which a generic or biosimilar marketing application can be submitted and the innovator’s data may be referenced but not approved for two years the overall 10year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if during the first eight years of those 10 years the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies 

european union orphan designation and exclusivity 

in the eu the ema’s committee for orphan medicinal products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10000 persons in the eu community or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis prevention or treatment has been authorized or if a method exists the product would be a significant benefit to those affected 

in the eu orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval this period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance 

of market exclusivity orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 

european data collection 

the collection and use of personal health data in the eu is governed by the provisions of the data protection directive and as of may 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr this directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data the data protection directive and gdpr also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu to the united states failure to comply with the requirements of the data protection directive the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties the gdpr introduces new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

european union drug marketing 

much like the antikickback statute prohibition in the united states the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the eu infringement of relevant eu laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment 

payments may be made to physicians in limited circumstances and in certain eu member states such payments must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians for the provision of services often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization andor the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

brexit and the regulatory framework in the united kingdom 

on june 23 2016 the electorate in the united kingdom voted in favor of leaving the eu commonly referred to as “brexit” thereafter on march 29 2017 the country formally notified the eu of its intention to withdraw pursuant to article 50 of the lisbon treaty the united kingdom formally left the eu on january 31 2020 a transition period began on february 1 2020 during which eu pharmaceutical law remains applicable to the united kingdom this transition period is due to end on december 31 2020 since the regulatory framework for pharmaceutical products in the united kingdom covering quality safety and efficacy of pharmaceutical products clinical trials marketing authorization commercial sales and distribution of pharmaceutical products is derived from eu directives and regulations brexit could materially impact the future regulatory regime which applies to products and the approval of product candidates in the united kingdom it remains to be seen how brexit will impact regulatory requirements for product candidates and products in the united kingdom 

rest of the world regulation 

for other countries outside of the eu and the united states such as countries in eastern europe latin america middle east or asia the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country additionally the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the declaration of helsinki 

if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements we may be subject to among other things fines suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals product recalls seizure of products operating restrictions or criminal prosecution 

other healthcare laws 

healthcare providers physicians and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval our future arrangements with third party payors healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval in the united states these laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback false claims physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations including but not limited to those described below 



the scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us we may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines imprisonment disgorgement exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid reputational harm additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to similar actions penalties and sanctions ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities can be time and resourceconsuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business 

current and future healthcare reform legislation 

in the united states and foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any investigational medicines for which we obtain marketing approval we expect that current laws as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or any strategic collaborators may receive for any approved products 

the aca for example contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lowercost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by medicaid programs extension of medicaid rebates to medicaid managed care plans mandatory discounts for certain medicare part d beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs with the current presidential administration and congress there may be additional administrative or legislative changes including modification repeal or replacement of all or certain provisions of the aca which may impact reimbursement for drugs and biologics since its enactment there have been numerous judicial administrative executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future for example various portions of the aca are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the fifth circuit court and the united states supreme court and the trump administration has issued various executive orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices additionally congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the aca it is unclear whether the aca will be overturned repealed replaced or further amended we cannot predict what affect further changes to the aca would have on our business 

additionally other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted 

 further there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which have resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products in addition the federal government state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs including pricecontrols restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs for example the federal government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs additionally the 

current administration released a “blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers while any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective congress and the administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative andor administrative measures to control drug costs 

individual states in the united states have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

packaging and distribution in the united states 

if our products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration additional laws and requirements apply products must meet applicable childresistant packaging requirements under the us poison prevention packaging act manufacturing sales promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 

the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations including extensive recordkeeping licensing storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products 

the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action depending on the circumstances failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution fines or other penalties injunctions exclusion from federal healthcare programs requests for recall seizure of products total or partial suspension of production denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts including government contracts any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way 

changes in regulations statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring for example i changes to our manufacturing arrangements ii additions or modifications to product labeling iii the recall or discontinuation of our products or iv additional recordkeeping requirements if any such changes were to be imposed they could adversely affect the operation of our business 

other us environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we may be subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes from time to time and in the future our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials and may also produce hazardous waste products even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities however we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us 

in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts in addition failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions

risks related to our business and creating a new class of medicines 

our pursuit of mrna1273 a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus “sarscov2” is at an early stage we have not previously tested our rapid response capability and may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner if at all 

in response to the global outbreak of coronavirus we are pursuing the rapid manufacture of mrna1273 in collaboration with the vaccine research center and division of microbiology and infectious diseases of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases “niaid” part of the national institutes of health “nih” the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations “cepi” has agreed to fund the cgmp manufacture of the preliminary clinical batches of the vaccine and niaid plans to conduct investigational new drugenabling “indenabling” studies and use such clinical batches to run a phase 1 clinical study in the united states our development of the vaccine is in early stages and we may be unable to produce a vaccine that successfully treats the virus in a timely manner if at all additionally our ability to develop an effective vaccine depends on the success of our rapid response capability which we have not previously tested and which will need to be funded by third parties in order to enable us to have sufficient capacity to respond to a global health challenge if the outbreak is effectively contained or the risk of coronavirus infection is diminished or eliminated before we can successfully develop and manufacture mrna1273 niaid or cepi could deprioritize their support for the development of our vaccine we are also committing financial resources and personnel to the development of mrna1273 which may cause delays in or otherwise negatively impact our other development programs despite uncertainties surrounding the longevity and extent of coronavirus as a global health concern our business could be negatively impacted by our allocation of significant resources to a global health threat that is unpredictable and could rapidly dissipate or against which our vaccine if developed may not be partially or fully effective in addition another party may be successful in producing a more efficacious vaccine or other treatment for sarscov2 which may also lead to the diversion of governmental and quasigovernmental funding away from us and toward other companies 

if we are successful in producing a vaccine against sarscov2 we may need to devote significant resources to its scaleup and development including for use by the us government 

in the event that the phase 1 clinical trials for mrna1273 that are to be conducted by niaid are perceived to be successful we may need to work toward the large scale technical development manufacturing scaleup and larger scale deployment of this potential vaccine through a variety of us government mechanisms such as an expanded access program or an emergency use authorization program in this case we may need to divert significant resources to this program which would require diversion of resources from our other programs in addition since the path to licensure of any vaccine against sarscov2   is unclear we may have a widely used vaccine in circulation in the united states or another country prior to our receipt of marketing approval unexpected safety issues in these circumstances could lead to significant reputational damage for moderna and our technology platform going forward and other issues including delays in our other programs the need for redesign of our clinical trials and the need for significant additional financial resources 

we will need to seek and secure significant funding through financings or from other sources clinical data or trial execution that creates delays setbacks or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities or the entire pipeline could result in an impaired ability or inability to finance or fund the company in the future 

we are currently advancing our pipeline of 24  development candidates across our 23  programs of which 12  development candidates are in clinical studies and another one  has an open investigational new drug application “ind” discovering development candidates and developing investigational medicines is expensive and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to i perform basic research perform preclinical studies and conduct clinical trials of our current and future programs ii continue to develop and expand our platform and infrastructure and supply preclinical studies and clinical trials with appropriate grade materials including cgmp materials iii seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines and iv launch and commercialize any 

products for which we receive regulatory approval including building our own commercial sales marketing and distribution organization 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 126 billion  in cash cash equivalents and investments we expect that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months however our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private equity or debt financings government or other thirdparty funding sales of assets marketing and distribution arrangements other collaborations and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches in any event we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our investigational medicines even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations our spending will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities because the length of time and activities associated with discovery of development candidates and development of our investigational medicines are highly uncertain we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development marketing and commercialization activities our future funding requirements both near and long term will depend on many factors including but not limited to 

 to date we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and revenue from strategic alliances and we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on favorable terms or at all until we can generate sufficient product or royalty revenue to finance our operations which we may never do we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings structured financings debt financings collaborations strategic alliances sales of assets licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements any fundraising efforts may divert our management from their daytoday activities which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our investigational medicines in addition we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts at the right time on favorable terms or at all negative clinical trial data or setbacks or perceived setbacks in our programs or with respect to our technology could impair our ability to raise additional financing on favorable terms or at all moreover the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities whether equity or debt by us or the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our shares to decline if we raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect our stockholders’ rights 

further to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock your ownership interest will be diluted if we raise additional capital through debt financing we would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements sales of assets or other collaborations strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our development candidates and investigational medicines technologies future revenue streams or research programs we also could be required to seek strategic collaborators for one or more of our current or future investigational 

medicines at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our rights to development candidates investigational medicines or ip that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts at the right time on favorable terms or at all we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or investigational medicines or one or more of our other research and development initiatives any of the above events could significantly harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations cause the price of our common stock to decline and negatively impact our ability to fund operations 

we attempt to distribute our technology biology execution and financing risks across a wide variety of therapeutic areas disease states programs and technologies however our assessment of and approach to risk may not be comprehensive or effectively avoid delays or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities failures in one or more of our programs or modalities could adversely impact other programs or modalities in our pipeline and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and ability to fund our business 

we are creating a new class of medicines based on mrna to improve the lives of patients from the beginning we designed our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mrna over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases we have made investments in our platform infrastructure and clinical capabilities that have enabled us to establish a pipeline of 24  development candidates across our 23  programs of which 12  development candidates are in clinical studies and another one  has an open ind as our development candidates and investigational medicines progress we or others may determine that certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient that we made platform level technology mistakes that individual programs or our mrna science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or underappreciated that our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will result in an inability to manufacture our investigational medicines for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing or that we have allocated resources in such a way that large investments are not recovered and capital allocation is not subject to rapid redirection all of these risks may relate to our current and future programs sharing similar science including mrna science and infrastructure and in the event material decisions in any of these areas turn out to have been incorrect or underoptimized we may experience a material adverse impact on our business and ability to fund our operations and we may never realize what we believe is the potential of mrna 

no mrna drug has been approved in this new potential class of medicines and may never be approved as a result of efforts by others or us mrna drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel and unprecedented nature of this new class of medicines 

as a potential new class of medicines no mrna medicines have been approved to date by the fda or other regulatory agency successful discovery and development of mrna medicines by either us or our strategic collaborators is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors many of which are beyond our or their control we have made and will continue to make a series of business decisions and take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline including those related to mrna technology delivery technology and manufacturing processes which may be shown to be incorrect based on further work by us our strategic collaborators or others to date there has never been a phase 3 trial or a commercialized product in which mrna is the primary active ingredient our mrna medicines that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance experience delays in the clinic experience clinical holds or fail to reach the market for many reasons including 



 currently mrna is considered a gene therapy product by the fda unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell dna and could act as a source of side effects mrnabased medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell dna however side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mrna medicines despite the differences in mechanism in addition because no product in which mrna is the primary active ingredient has been approved the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain the number and design of the clinical and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established may be different from those required for gene therapy products or may require safety testing like gene therapy products moreover the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next and may be difficult to predict 

we have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 

we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 2009 including net losses of 5140 million  3847 million  and 2559 million  for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as of december 31 2019  we had an accumulated deficit of 150 billion  

we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development including our clinical and preclinical development activities and the development of our platform to date we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and proceeds from strategic alliances and to a lesser extent through grants from governmental and private organizations the amount of our future net losses will depend in part on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings sales of assets strategic alliances or additional grants we have not commenced or completed pivotal clinical studies for any of our programs in clinical trials or investigational medicines and it will be several years if ever before we or our strategic collaborators have an investigational medicine ready for commercialization even if we obtain regulatory approval to market an investigational medicine our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our investigational medicines have received approval and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance reimbursement from thirdparty payors and adequate market share in those markets we may never achieve profitability 

we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we 



 our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our financing or funding ability as well as negatively impact our ability to exist as a standalone company 

our financial condition and operating results have varied in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear in the future due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



 due to the various factors mentioned herein and others the results of any of our prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 

the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear such that a periodtoperiod comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance in any particular quarter or quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline we do not control the timing of disclosure of any such milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators any disclosure by our strategic collaborators or competitors of data or other events that are perceived as negative whether or not such data are related to other data that we or others release may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or overall valuation our stock price may decline as a result of unexpected clinical trial results in one or more of our programs including adverse safety events reported for any of our programs 

our business is highly dependent on the clinical advancement of our programs and modalities delay or failure to advance programs or modalities could adversely impact our business 

using our platform we are developing product features for medicines based on mrna over time our platform work led to commonalities where a specific combination of mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes generated a set of product features shared by multiple programs this is what we call a “ modality ” we have historically utilized and expect to continue to utilize earlier programs in a modality to understand the technology risks within the modality including manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties even if our earlier programs in a modality are successful in any phase of development any of such earlier programs may fail at a later phase of development and other programs within the same modality may still fail at any phase of development including at phases where earlier programs in that modality were successful this may be a result of technical challenges unique to that program or due to biology risk which is unique to every program as we progress our programs through clinical development there may be new technical challenges that arise that cause an entire modality to fail 

while we aim to segregate risk using modalities there may be foreseen and unforeseen risks across modalities in whole or in part these include but are not limited to mrna chemical modifications and lnps and their components in addition if any one or more of our clinical programs encounter safety tolerability or efficacy problems developmental delays regulatory issues or other problems our platform approach and business could be significantly harmed we may believe that a particular modality has been derisked but later determine that new and different risks exist with respect to such modality 

in addition the biology risk across the majority of our pipeline represents targets and pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs while we believe we have made progress in seeking to reduce biology risk in certain settings such as for vaccine targets for which we and others have shown the utility of neutralizing antibodies the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across the majority of our current and future programs 

while we attempt to diversify our risks by developing one or more programs in each modality there are risks that are unique to each modality and risks that are applicable across modalities these risks may impair our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development obtain regulatory approval or ultimately commercialize our programs or cause us to experience significant delays in doing so any of which may materially harm our business 

certain features in our development candidates and investigational medicines including those related to mrna chemical modifications surface chemistries lnps and their components may result in foreseen and unforeseen risks that are active across some or all of our modalities any such portfolio spanning risks whether known or unknown if realized in any one of our programs would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our business as a whole 

there are specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and our programs as a whole for example prophylactic vaccines typically require clinical testing in thousands to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefitrisk profile the need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even spurious safety findings negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch while we believe that certain safety tolerability and levels of immunogenicity we have observed in the earlystage clinical trials in our prophylactic vaccine programs are sufficient to initiate additional trials there can be no assurance that we will observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in laterstage trials required for approval of these programs for neoantigen cancer vaccines to date no molecular noncellbased therapeutic protein vaccine has been shown to be effective against cancer and there are many clinical and manufacturing challenges to personalized medicines including cellbased therapies and vaccines these risks include a rapid production turnaround time that is measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors the significant costs 

incurred in making individualized vaccines and potential lack of immune responses potentially due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient these and other risks apply to our pcv and other neoepitope investigational medicine programs additionally there may be challenges in delivering an adequate quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient “api” required to drive efficacy due to the limitation in volume of api that can be delivered to a specific location like a tumor or injured tissue our therapies for local injections often require specialized skills for conducting a clinical trial that could delay trials or slow or impair commercialization of an approved investigational medicine due to the poor adoption of injected local therapeutics or intratumoral therapies in addition the uncertain translatability of target selection from preclinical animal models including mouse and nonhuman primate models to successful clinical trial results may be impossible particularly for immunooncology and systemic therapies and cancer vaccines in general several biological steps are required for delivery of mrna to translate into therapeutically active medicines these processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues and this could lead to variable levels of therapeutic protein variable activity immunogenicity or variable distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect gene therapies and mrnabased medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product eg the mrna or the delivery vehicle such as an lnp as well as against the encoded protein giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a side effect these risks apply to all of our programs including our systemic secreted therapeutics and systemic intracellular therapeutics modalities 

risks related to the research development regulatory review and approval of our existing and future pipeline 

preclinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially for a new class of medicines such as mrna and therefore our preclinical programs or development candidates may be delayed terminated or may never advance to the clinic any of which may affect our ability to obtain funding and may have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

much of our pipeline is in preclinical development and these programs could be delayed or not advance into the clinic before we can initiate clinical trials for a development candidate we must complete extensive preclinical studies including indenabling glp toxicology testing that support our planned inds in the united states or similar applications in other jurisdictions we must also complete extensive work on chemistry manufacturing and controls “cmc” activities including yield purity and stability data to be included in the ind filing cmc activities for a new class of medicines such as mrna require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our preclinical or clinical development candidates if we are required to produce new batches of our development candidates due to insufficient shelf life it may delay the commencement or completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials of such development candidates for example we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the fda or other regulatory authorities will accept the results of our preclinical testing or our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical testing studies and cmc activities will ultimately support the further development of our programs as a result we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit inds or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect if at all and we cannot be sure that submission of inds or similar applications will result in the fda or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin 

clinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially with a new class of medicines such as mrna medicines clinical trials of our investigational medicines may be delayed and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate any of which could affect our ability to fund the company and would have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

clinical testing is expensive and complex and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain we may not be able to initiate may experience delays in or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators also may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of any clinical trials that we or our strategic collaborators conduct that could delay or prevent us or our strategic collaborators from successfully developing our investigational medicines including 



 we could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities ethics committees or the irbs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted or if such trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the data safety monitoring board for such trial we have in the past and may in the future be delayed in gaining clearance from the fda or other regulators to initiate clinical trials through the imposition of a clinical hold in order to address comments from such regulators on our clinical trial design or other elements of our clinical trials the clinical trials of other companies working on mrna medicines have been put on clinical hold by the fda a suspension or termination may be imposed due 

to a number of factors including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects including those experienced by other investigational medicines in the same class as our investigational medicines failure to demonstrate a benefit or adequate benefit risk ratio from using an investigational medicine failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our investigational medicines we must also complete extensive cmc activities that require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our clinical development candidates or investigational medicines if we are required to produce new batches of our development candidates or investigational medicines due to insufficient shelf life it may delay the commencement or completion of clinical trials of such development candidates or investigational medicines 

moreover the fda has indicated that prior to commencing laterstage clinical trials for our programs we will need to develop assays to measure and predict the potency of a given dose of our investigational medicines any delay in developing assays that are acceptable to the fda or other regulators could delay the start of future clinical trials further the fda or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data for our clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials 

significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our investigational medicines also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines and harming our business and results of operations any delays in the development of our investigational medicines may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly 

we may experience delays in identifying and enrolling participants in our clinical trials which would delay the progress of our investigational medicines and result in increased expenses 

we depend on enrollment of participants in our clinical trials for our investigational medicines we may find it difficult to enroll trial participants in our clinical studies which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our investigational medicines identifying and qualifying trial participants to participate in clinical studies of our investigational medicines is critical to our success the timing of our clinical studies depends on the speed at which we can recruit trial participants to participate in testing our investigational medicines delays in enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our investigational medicines if trial participants are unwilling to participate in our studies because of negative publicity from adverse events in our trials or other trials of similar products or those related to specific therapeutic area or for other reasons including competitive clinical studies for similar patient populations the timeline for recruiting trial participants conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed these delays could result in increased costs delays in advancing our product development delays in testing the effectiveness of our product or termination of the clinical studies altogether 

we may not be able to identify recruit and enroll a sufficient number of trial participants or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study to complete our clinical studies in a timely manner patient and subject enrollment is affected by factors including 



 in addition our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for investigational medicines that are in the same therapeutic areas as our investigational medicines and this competition will reduce the number and types of trial participants available to us because some trial participants who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by a third party since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use which will reduce the number of trial participants who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites moreover because in some cases our investigational medicines represent a departure from more traditional methods for disease treatment and prevention potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies or other new therapies rather than enroll trial participants in any future clinical trial involving mrna investigational medicines additionally if new investigational medicines such as gene editing therapies show encouraging results potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to enroll trial participants in clinical trials using those investigational medicines if such new investigational medicines show discouraging results or other adverse safety indications potential trial participants and their doctors may be less inclined to enroll trial participants in our clinical trials we also have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators control the development of certain of our investigational medicines which may provide us limited or no ability to influence the enrollment rate of our clinical trials 

even if we are able to enroll trial participants there is no guarantee that they will ultimately be dosed as part of or complete a clinical trial for example although we have announced that the first patient has been enrolled in the phase 12 study of mrna3704 in patients with isolated methylmalonic acidemia “mma” due to mut deficiency there is no guarantee that this patient will ultimately be dosed as part of or complete the phase 12 study 

mrna medicines are a novel approach and negative perception of the efficacy safety or tolerability of any investigational medicines that we develop could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business advance our investigational medicines or obtain regulatory approvals 

as a potential new class of medicines no mrna medicines have been approved to date by the fda or other regulators adverse events in clinical trials of our investigational medicines or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity as well as any other adverse events in the field of mrna medicine or other products that are perceived to be similar to mrna medicines such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs increased regulatory scrutiny decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our investigational medicines and less demand for any product that we may develop our large pipeline of development candidates and investigational medicines could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions “susars” other reportable negative clinical outcomes manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the fda or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs as well as our business as a whole in addition responses by us state or foreign governments to negative public perception may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop any investigational medicines or commercialize any approved products obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability more restrictive statutory regimes government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development of our investigational medicines and commercialization of any approved products or demand for any products we may develop 

because we are developing some of our development candidates or investigational medicines for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and in some cases using new endpoints or methodologies the fda or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results 

there are no pharmacologic therapies approved to treat the underlying causes of many diseases that we currently attempt to address or may address in the future for instance for mma or pa few clinical trials have been attempted in addition there has been limited clinical trial experience for the development of pharmaceuticals to treat these rare diseases in general and we are not aware of a registrational trial that led to approval of a drug to treat these diseases there have been some historical trials with other agents to address organic acidemias which may have utilized clinical endpoints that are less applicable to our efforts with our mma and pa programs that address the underlying defect as a result the design and conduct of clinical trials of investigational medicines for the treatment of these disorders and other disorders may take longer be more costly or be less effective as part of the novelty of development in these diseases 

even if the fda does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful we may not achieve the prespecified endpoint to a degree of statistical significance in any pivotal or other clinical trials we or our strategic collaborators may conduct for our programs further even if we do achieve the prespecified criteria our trials may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with the results of the more traditional efficacy endpoints in the trial the fda also could give overriding weight to other efficacy endpoints over a primary endpoint even if we achieve statistically significant results on that endpoint if we do not do so on our secondary efficacy endpoints the fda also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks and the fda may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of licensure other regulatory authorities in europe and other countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints 

some of our investigational medicines are classified as gene therapies by the fda and the ema and the fda has indicated that our investigational medicines will be reviewed within its center for biologics evaluation and research “cber” even though our mrna investigational medicines are designed to have a different mechanism of action from gene therapies the association of our investigational medicines with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens impair the reputation of our investigational medicines or negatively impact our platform or our business 

there have been few approvals of gene therapy products in the united states or foreign jurisdictions and there have been wellreported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use gene therapy products have the effect of introducing new dna and potentially irreversibly changing the dna in a cell in contrast mrna is highly unlikely to localize to the nucleus integrate into the dna or otherwise make any permanent changes to cell dna consequently we expect that our investigational medicines will have a different potential side effect profile from gene therapies 

regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future and the implications for mrnabased therapies is unknown for example the fda has established the office of tissues and advanced therapies within cber to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products and convenes the cellular tissue and gene therapies advisory committee to advise cber on its review in the eu mrna has been characterized as a gene therapy medicinal product in certain countries mrna therapies have not yet been classified or any such classification is not known to us specifically in japan the pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency has not taken a position on the regulatory classification notwithstanding the differences between our mrna investigational medicines and gene therapies the classification of some of our mrna investigational medicines as gene therapies in the united states the eu and potentially other countries could adversely impact our ability to develop our investigational medicines and could negatively impact our platform and our business for instance a clinical hold on gene therapy products across the field due to risks associated with altering cell dna irreversibly may apply to our mrna investigational medicines irrespective of the mechanistic differences between gene therapies and mrna 

adverse events reported with respect to gene therapies or genome editing therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs although our mrna development candidates and investigational medicines are designed not to make any permanent changes to cell dna regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies products caused by introducing new dna and irreversibly changing the dna in a cell could also be a risk for our mrna investigational therapies and as a result may delay one or more of our trials or impose additional testing for longterm side effects any new requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory review agencies may have a negative effect on our business by lengthening the regulatory review process requiring us to perform additional or larger studies or increasing our development costs any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines or lead to significant postapproval studies limitations or restrictions as we advance our investigational medicines we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines if we fail to do so we may be required to delay or discontinue development of some or all of our investigational medicines 

a breakthrough therapy designation or fast track designation by the fda for a drug may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it would not increase the likelihood that the drug will receive marketing approval 

we may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for one or more of our investigational medicines a breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development for drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies interaction and communication between the fda and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the fda are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the bla 

designation as a breakthrough therapy is at the discretion of the fda accordingly even if we believe that one of our investigational medicines meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such 

designation in any event the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a drug may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the fda even if we are successful in obtaining accelerated approval in the us or under comparable pathways in other jurisdictions we may face requirements and limitations that will adversely affect our prospects for example we may be approved only for a very limited indication we may not successfully complete required postapproval trials such trials may not confirm the clinical benefit of our drug or approval of the drug may be withdrawn in addition even if one or more of our investigational medicines qualify as breakthrough therapies the fda may later decide that the investigational medicine no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for fda review or approval will not be shortened 

we have received fast track designation for some of our investigational medicines and may see fast track designation for others if a therapy is intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening condition and the therapy demonstrates the potential to address significant unmet medical needs for this condition the drug sponsor may apply for fast track designation the fda has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation and even if we believe a particular investigational medicine is eligible for this designation we cannot assure you that the fda would decide to grant it even if we do receive fast track designation we may not experience a faster development process review or approval compared to conventional fda procedures the fda may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the fda’s priority review procedures 

we may fail to obtain and maintain orphan drug designations from the fda for our future investigational medicines as applicable 

our strategy includes filing for orphan drug designation where available for our investigational medicines and we have received orphan drug designation from both the fda and the european commission for mma mrna3704 and pa mrna3927 under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200000 in the united states or a patient population greater than 200000 in the united states where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the united states in the united states orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs tax advantages and userfee waivers however orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications including a full nda or bla to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the original manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity 

in addition exclusive marketing rights in the united states may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphandesignated indication or may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective further even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may receive and be approved for the same condition and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity even after an orphandesignated product is approved the fda can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care in addition while we may seek additional orphan drug designation for our investigational medicines we may never receive such further designations 

our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 collectively the “aca” includes a subtitle called the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 “bpcia” which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdaapproved reference biological product under the bpcia an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the fda until four years following the date that the reference product was first approved by the fda in addition the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the fda until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first approved during this 12year period of exclusivity another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the fda approves a bla for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety purity and potency of the other company’s product the law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty 

we believe that any of our investigational medicines approved as a biological product under a bla should qualify for the 12year period of exclusivity however there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise or that 

the fda will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated other aspects of the bpcia some of which may impact the bpcia exclusivity provisions have also been the subject of recent litigation moreover the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing 

any clinical trials of our oncologyrelated products that we conduct with a seamless trial design may not be acceptable to regulatory authorities in the form submitted or at all which may delay our clinical development and limit or change the type of information we may gather from our clinical trials 

we may pursue a development program for our oncologyrelated products that relies upon a seamless trial design which presents additional risks compared to traditional threephase development programs a seamless trial design can be achieved through a firstinhuman “fih” multiple expansion cohort trial which has a single protocol with an initial doseescalation phase and also contains three or more additional patient cohorts with cohortspecific objectives fih multiple expansion cohort trials are intended to expedite development by seamlessly proceeding from initial determination of a potential effective dose to individual cohorts that have trial objectives typical of phase 2 trials challenges and risks associated with such seamless trial designs include challenges in the timely dissemination of new safety information to investigators irbs and regulators exposing a large number of patients across cohorts to potentially suboptimal or toxic doses of an investigational drug exposing more patients than is needed to achieve the cohort’s objectives and missed interpretations of preliminary trial results and unplanned analyses which can lead to delays in clinical development regulatory authorities may find our seamless trial designs unacceptable based on these and other risks of utilizing such designs 

if we are not able to obtain or if there are delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals we will not be able to commercialize or will be delayed in commercializing investigational medicines we may develop and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired 

even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials the marketing approval process is expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of any development candidates and investigational medicines we may develop any mrna medicine we may develop and the activities associated with its development and commercialization including design testing manufacture recordkeeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and by comparable global health authorities to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe pure and potent or effective in humans including the target population successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a bla to the fda a marketing authorization application “maa” to the ema and similar marketing applications to comparable global regulatory authorities for each investigational medicine and consequently the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any investigational medicines 

failure to obtain marketing approval for an investigational medicine will prevent us from commercializing the investigational medicine in a given jurisdiction we have not received approval to market any investigational medicines from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction and it is possible that none of our investigational medicines or any investigational medicines we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval we have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and may need to rely on thirdparty cros or regulatory consultants to assist us in this process to our knowledge there is no current precedent for an mrnabased medicine such as the types we are developing being approved for sale by the fda or any other global regulatory agency although we expect to submit blas for our mrnabased investigational medicines in the united states other jurisdictions may consider our mrnabased investigational medicines to be new drugs not biologics and require different marketing applications securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each therapeutic indication to establish the investigational medicine’s safety and efficacy securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to and inspection of manufacturing facilities by the relevant regulatory authority any investigational medicines we develop may not be effective may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use 

the process of obtaining marketing approvals both in the united states and abroad is expensive may take many years if additional clinical trials are required if approval is obtained at all and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors including the type complexity and novelty of the investigational medicines involved changes in marketing approval policies during the development period changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application the fda and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical clinical or other studies in addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing approval of an investigational medicine any 

marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or postapproval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable additional delays or nonapproval may result if an fda advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends nonapproval or restrictions on approval in addition we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development clinical studies and the review process 

regulatory agencies also may approve an mrna medicine for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of postmarketing studies in addition regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our investigational medicines 

the fda and other regulatory agencies review the cmc section of regulatory filings any aspects found unsatisfactory by regulatory agencies may result in delays in clinical trials and commercialization in addition the regulatory agencies conduct preapproval inspections at the time of a bla any findings by regulatory agencies and failure to comply with requirements may lead to delay in approval and failure to commercialize the potential mrna investigational medicine 

if we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any investigational medicines we may develop the commercial prospects for those investigational medicines will be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired 

we may never obtain ema or other foreign regulatory body approval for any of our investigational medicines and even if we do we may never be able to commercialize any of our investigational medicines in any other jurisdiction which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential 

approval by the fda in the united states if obtained does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions in order to eventually market any of our investigational medicines in any particular foreign jurisdiction we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis regarding safety and efficacy in addition clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 

seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming regulatory requirements can vary widely from countrytocountry and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries the foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with fda approval we do not have any investigational medicines approved for sale in any jurisdiction including international markets and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized 

our planned clinical trials or those of our strategic collaborators may reveal significant adverse events not seen in our preclinical or nonclinical studies and may result in a safety profile that could delay or terminate clinical trials or delay or prevent regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our investigational medicines 

there is typically an extremely high rate of attrition for product candidates across categories of medicines proceeding through clinical trials these product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile in later stages of clinical trials despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in laterstage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety profiles notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are never approved as products and there can be no assurance that any of our current or future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our investigational medicines 

some of our investigational medicines are developed or intended to be coadministered with other developmental therapies or approved medicines for example our pcv investigational medicine mrna4157 and our kras investigational medicine mrna5671 in collaboration with merck may be coadministered with merck’s antipd1 therapy pembrolizumab our il12 investigational medicine medi1191 in collaboration with astrazeneca is being developed to be coadministered with checkpoint inhibitors eg antipdl1 antictla4 these combinations may have additional side effects the uncertainty resulting from the use of our investigational medicines in combination with other therapies may make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials 

some of our development candidates and investigational medicines are developed or intended for adolescent andor pediatric patients under the age of eighteen for example we have clinical trial sites open for and have enrolled a patient in our mma development candidate mrna3704 for a firstinhuman phase 12 trial in patients between one and eighteen years of age if successfully dosed these will be the first of our investigational medicines given to subjects eighteen years of age or younger and mrna3704 will be the first of our investigational medicines from our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality dosed in humans the uncertainty resulting from the first dosing of young human subjects with an investigational medicine from our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality makes it difficult to accurately predict if significant adverse events or other side effects will be observed 

most of our investigational medicines are formulated and administered in an lnp which when administered may lead to systemic side effects related to the components of the lnp some of which may not have been previously tested in humans while we have continued to optimize our lnps there can be no assurance that our lnps will not have undesired effects our lnps could contribute in whole or in part to one or more of the following immune reactions infusion reactions complement reactions opsonization reactions antibody reactions or reactions to peg certain aspects of our investigational medicines may induce immune reactions from either the mrna or the lipid as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mrna or the lnp any of which could lead to significant adverse events in one or more of our clinical trials many of these types of side effects have been seen for previously developed lnps there may be resulting uncertainty as to the underlying cause of any such adverse event which would make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials and would result in significant delays in our programs 

if significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials we may have difficulty recruiting trial participants to any of our clinical trials trial participants may withdraw from trials or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of one or more development candidates or investigational medicines altogether we the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities or an irb may impose a clinical hold or suspend or terminate clinical trials of an investigational medicine at any time for various reasons including a belief that participants in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in earlystage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval unfavorable benefit risk ratio may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies any of these developments could materially harm our business financial condition and prospects 

  

even if we obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medicine our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny 

even if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction the applicable regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly postapproval studies or postmarket surveillance for example the holder of an approved bla is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the bla the holder of an approved bla must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product product labeling or manufacturing process advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our investigational medicines a regulatory agency may 

 any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize any approved products and generate revenues 

if any of our investigational medicines cause undesirable side effects it could delay or prevent their regulatory approval limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval investigational medicines we may develop may be associated with an adverse immune response or other serious adverse events undesirable side effects or unexpected characteristics in addition to serious adverse events or side effects caused by any of our investigational 

medicines the administration process or related procedures also can cause undesirable side effects if any such events occur the clinical trials of any of our investigational medicines could be suspended or terminated 

if in the future we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by factors other than our investigational medicine the fda the ema or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of any of our investigational medicines for any or all targeted indications even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not productrelated such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled trial participants to complete the trial moreover if we elect or are required to delay suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our investigational medicines the commercial prospects of such investigational medicines may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these investigational medicines may be delayed or eliminated any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop investigational medicines and may harm our business financial condition result of operations and prospects significantly 

additionally if we successfully obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medicine the fda or other regulatory authority could require us to adopt a rems to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such investigational medicine outweigh the risks for each potential patient which may include among other things a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients a communication plan to health care practitioners extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry furthermore if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop several potentially significant negative consequences could result including 

 any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any products we may identify and develop and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are successful in gaining approval for any of our investigational medicines we will continue to face significant regulatory oversight of the manufacturing and distribution of our products product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp and adherence to commitments made in the bla if we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing 

our ability to generate product revenue is dependent on the success of one or more of our development candidates or investigational medicines each of which is at an earlystage of development and will require significant additional development and clinical testing before we can seek marketing approval and begin commercial sales 

our ability to generate product revenue is highly dependent on our or our strategic collaborators’ ability to develop obtain regulatory approval of and successfully commercialize one or more of our development candidates or investigational medicines our development candidates and investigational medicines are in the early stages of development and will require additional clinical and nonclinical development regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market the products in addition substantial investment access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts will be required before we can generate any revenue from product sales before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our investigational medicines we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational medicines in humans we cannot be certain that any of our investigational medicines will be successful in clinical studies and they may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical studies even if approved our investigational medicines also need to demonstrate health economic benefit in order to establish pricing and reimbursement we may also need to conduct additional evaluation of safety and health outcomes in a postapproval setting 

risks related to the manufacturing of our development candidates investigational medicines and our future pipeline 

our mrna development candidates and investigational medicines are based on novel technologies and any development candidates and investigational medicines we develop may be complex and difficult to manufacture we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping if we or any of our third 

party manufacturers encounter such difficulties our ability to supply material for clinical trials or any approved product could be delayed or stopped 

the manufacturing processes for our development candidates and investigational medicines are novel and complex there are no mrna medicines commercialized to date or manufactured at such scale due to the novel nature of this technology and limited experience at larger scale production we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping these difficulties could be due to any number of reasons including but not limited to complexities of producing batches at larger scale equipment failure choice and quality of raw materials and excipients analytical testing technology and product instability in an effort to optimize product features we have in the past and may in the future make changes to our development candidates or investigational medicines in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions this has in the past resulted in and may in the future result in our having to resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply insufficient stability or shelf life of our development candidates and investigational medicines could materially delay our or our strategic collaborators’ ability to continue the clinical trial for that development candidate or investigational medicine or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product due to the need to manufacture additional preclinical or clinical supply 

our rate of innovation is high which has resulted in and will continue to cause a high degree of technology change that can negatively impact product comparability during and after clinical development furthermore technology changes may drive the need for changes in modification to or the sourcing of new manufacturing infrastructure or may adversely affect thirdparty relationships 

the process to generate mrna investigational medicines encapsulated in lnps is complex and if not developed and manufactured under wellcontrolled conditions can adversely impact pharmacological activity furthermore we have not manufactured mrna medicines at commercial scale we may encounter difficulties in scaling up our manufacturing process thereby potentially impacting clinical and commercial supply 

we are scaling up our batch size to accommodate the clinical supply requirements of some of our programs however in many cases we may have to utilize multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the clinical supply requirement of a single clinical trial failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials 

as we continue developing new manufacturing processes for our drug substance and drug product the changes we implement to manufacturing process may in turn impact specification and stability of the drug product changes in our manufacturing processes may lead to failure of batches and this could lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials our mrna investigational medicines may prove to have a stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved mrna medicine this poses risk in supply requirements wasted stock and higher cost of goods 

we are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology further we have developed our own custom manufacturing equipment for certain of our investigational medicines if such equipment malfunctions or we encounter unexpected performance issues we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply due to the number of different programs we may have cross contamination of products inside of our factories cros suppliers or in the clinic that affect the integrity of our products 

as we scale the manufacturing output for particular programs we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates from indenabling studies through commercial launch including shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance because of continuous improvement in manufacturing processes we may switch processes for a particular program during development however after the change in process more time is required for pharmaceutical property testing such as 6 or 12 month stability testing that may require resupplying clinical material or making additional cgmp batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed 

we are utilizing a number of raw materials and excipients that have a single source of supply are new to the pharmaceutical industry and are being employed in a novel manner some of these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures or supply shortages such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our investigational medicines 

we have established a number of analytical assays and may have to establish several more to assess the quality of our mrna investigational medicines we may identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall for example we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety efficacy or stability this may lead to an inability to release mrna investigational medicines until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified 

our product and product intermediates are extremely temperature sensitive and we may learn that any or all of our products are less stable than desired we may also find that transportation conditions negatively impact product quality this may require changes to the formulation or manufacturing process for one or more of our investigational medicines and result in delays or interruptions to clinical 

or commercial supply in addition the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of vendors may also add additional risks of supply disruptions 

as our drug development pipeline increases and matures the increased demand for clinical and commercial supplies from our facilities and third parties may impact our ability to operate we will require increased capacity across our entire supply chain furthermore we rely on many service providers including those that provide manufacturing or testing services all of whom have inherent risks in their operations that may adversely impact our operations 

we currently utilize and expect to continue to utilize third parties to among other things manufacture raw materials components parts and consumables and to perform quality testing if the field of mrna and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand we may encounter increasing competition for these materials and services demand for thirdparty manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity which could disrupt our ability to find and retain thirdparty manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials components parts and consumables required to manufacture our mrna investigational medicines the use of service providers and suppliers could expose us to risks including but not limited to 

 we are subject to regulatory and operational risks associated with the physical and digital infrastructure at both our internal manufacturing facilities and at those of our external service providers 

in 2018 we completed construction of a new manufacturing facility moderna technology center “mtc” in norwood massachusetts that among other things is intended for cgmp manufacture of drug substance and drug product while the design of the facility is based on current standards for biotechnology facilities it has not been reviewed or preapproved by any regulatory agency nor has the facility been inspected by any regulatory agency such as the fda we have only recently begun producing drug substance and drug product at the mtc for our preclinical and clinical use we could incur delays in implementing the full operational state of the facility causing delays to clinical supply or extended use of thirdparty service providers resulting in unplanned expenses in constructing the mtc facility we have incurred substantial expenditures and expect to incur significant additional expenditures in validating and operating the facility in the future 

we have designed the mtc to incorporate a significant level of automation of equipment with integration of several digital systems to improve efficiency of operations we have attempted to achieve a high level of digitization for a clinical manufacturing facility relative to industry standards while this is meant to improve operational efficiency this may pose additional risk of process equipment malfunction and even overall manufacturing system failure or shutdown due to internal or external factors including but not limited to design issues system compatibility or potential cybersecurity breaches this may lead to delay in supply or shutdown of our facility any disruption in our manufacturing capabilities at the mtc could cause delays in our production capacity for our drug substances or drug products impose additional costs or may require us to identify qualify and establish an alternative manufacturing site the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as we expand our development and commercial capacity we may establish additional manufacturing capabilities inside the mtc footprint or expand to other locations or geographies which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly if we fail to select the correct location complete the construction in an efficient manner recruit the required personnel and generally manage our growth effectively the development and production of our investigational medicines could be delayed or curtailed additional investments may be needed if changes in our manufacturing process lead to required changes in the mtc’s infrastructure 

there are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing operations that could affect our ability and the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or contract manufacturing organizations to meet our delivery requirements or provide adequate amounts of material 

the convergence of process and analytical technology raw materials consumables equipment physical infrastructure including a clean room environment and air handling and other utilities results in complex procedures and systems that have to work effectively to manufacture our investigational medicines failure or process defects in any of the interrelated systems at either our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty providers could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and supply our investigational medicines 

our investigational medicines are inherently sensitive to shipping and storage conditions which in some cases requires coldchain logistics and could subject our investigational medicines to risk of loss or damage 

our investigational medicines are sensitive to temperature storage and handling conditions loss in investigational medicines could occur if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly shelf life for our investigational medicines may vary by product and is not fully quantified and is expected to be variable and it is possible that our investigational medicines could be lost due to expiration prior to use coldchain logistics are required for certain of our investigational medicines if we do not effectively maintain our coldchain supply logistics then we may experience an unusual number of returned or out of date products 

  

failure to effectively maintain our coldchain supply logistics by us or third parties has in the past and could in the future lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials or otherwise 

we are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing our mrna investigational medicines our manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers may not meet regulatory requirements failure to meet cgmp requirements set forth in regulations promulgated by the fda ema and other global health authorities could result in significant delays in and costs of our products 

the manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation components of a finished product approved for commercial use or used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cgmp requirements these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures including record keeping and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of products and materials used in clinical trials poor control of the cgmp production processes can lead to product quality failures that can impact our ability to supply product resulting in cost overruns and delays to clinical timelines which could be extensive such production process issues include but are not limited to 

 we must supply all necessary documentation in support of a bla or other marketing authorization application on a timely basis and must adhere to the fda’s ema’s and other countries’ cgmp requirements which are enforced in the case of the fda in part through its facilities inspection program 

regulatory authorities typically require representative manufacturing site inspections to assess adequate compliance with cgmps and manufacturing controls as described in the filing if either we or one of our thirdparty manufacturing sites fails to provide sufficient quality assurance or control the product approval to commercialize may not be granted inspections by regulatory authorities may occur at any time during the development or commercialization phase of products the inspections may be product specific or facility specific for broader cgmp inspections or as a follow up to market or development issues that the regulatory agency may identify deficient inspection outcomes may influence the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations impacting or delaying supply or delaying programs 

the manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority approval process and we may need to contract with manufacturers who we believe can meet applicable fda and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis if we or our thirdparty manufacturers are unable to reliably produce investigational medicines to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities we or our strategic collaborators may not obtain or maintain the approvals we or they need to commercialize such products even if we or our strategic collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our mrna medicines there is no assurance that either we or our contract manufacturing organizations will be able to 

manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials increase clinical trial costs delay approval of our investigational medicines impair commercialization efforts or increase our cost of goods the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

in addition we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control quality assurance and qualified personnel furthermore all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply or manufacture materials or products for such companies which exposes our contract manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products as a result failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory status of our contract manufacturers’ facility our failure or the failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us including clinical holds fines injunctions civil penalties delays suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation seizures or recalls of investigational medicines or products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and investigational medicines including those of our strategic collaborators and our overall business operations our potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our investigational medicines and raw materials may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis 

the fda the ema and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time under some circumstances the fda the ema or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we do not distribute a lot or lots until the relevant agency authorizes such release deviations in the manufacturing process including those affecting quality attributes and stability may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls our thirdparty contract manufacturers have in the past experienced lot failures and some may have experienced product recalls lot failures have in the past caused and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own facilities or those of our thirdparty manufacturers could cause us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific qualitycontrol and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes and operations which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements while we will train and qualify all personnel around the appropriate handling of our products and materials we may not be able to control for or ultimately detect intentional sabotage or negligence by any employee or contractor 

risks specific to certain investigational medicines 

our pcv investigational medicine is uniquely manufactured for each patient using a novel complex manufacturing process and we may encounter difficulties in production 

we custom design and manufacture pcvs that are unique and tailored specifically for each patient manufacturing unique lots of pcvs is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with 



 we have built and installed custom manufacturing equipment for pcv that has been incorporated into a personalized vaccine unit in the mtc this unit is currently operational and we are producing batches of pcv from our location and a thirdparty suppliers this equipment may not function as designed which may lead to deviations in the drug product being produced this can lead to increased batch failure and the inability to supply patients enrolled in the clinical trial if our clinical development plans are expanded due to the custom nature of the equipment and singleuse assemblies we may not be able to supply this expanded need reliably without significant investments in addition there will be considerable time to scale up our facilities or build new facilities before we can begin to meet any commercial demand if our pcv product is approved this expansion or addition of new facilities could also lead to product comparability issues which can further delay introduction of new capacity 

because our pcvs are manufactured for each individual patient we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient’s tissue sample sequence data derived from such tissue sample results of analysis of such patient’s genomic analysis and the custom manufactured product for each patient maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex and failure to do so has in the past and may in the future result in product mix up adverse patient outcomes loss of product or regulatory action including withdrawal of any approved products from the market further as our pcv investigational medicine is developed through earlystage clinical studies to laterstage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection analysis manufacture and delivery process will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results these changes may not achieve the intended objectives and any of these changes could cause our pcvs to perform differently than we expect potentially affecting the results of clinical trials 

risks related to our reliance on third parties 

we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into strategic alliances with third parties to develop investigational medicines if these strategic alliances are not successful our business could be adversely affected 

we have limited resources to conduct clinical operations and have not yet established infrastructure for sales marketing or distribution accordingly we have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators have provided and may in the future provide funding and other resources for developing and potentially commercializing our investigational medicines we expect to enter into additional strategic alliances to access additional funding capabilities and expertise in the future our existing strategic alliances and any future strategic alliances we enter into may pose a number of risks including the following 



 if our strategic alliances do not result in the successful development and commercialization of programs or if one of our strategic collaborators terminates its agreement with us we may not receive any future research funding or milestone earnout royalty or other contingent payments under the strategic alliances if we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements our development of investigational medicines could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our investigational medicines in addition in general our strategic collaborators have the right to terminate their agreements with us for convenience a strategic collaborator has in the past terminated its agreement with us if one of our strategic collaborators terminates its agreement with us we may find it more difficult to attract new strategic collaborators and the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected all of the risks relating to product development regulatory approval and commercialization described in this annual report on form 10k apply to the activities of our strategic collaborators 

our strategic collaborators control aspects of our clinical trials regulatory activities and other aspects of our strategic alliances which could result in delays and other obstacles in the development and commercialization of our proposed products and materially harm our results of operations 

for some programs we depend on strategic collaborators to design and conduct clinical trials for our investigational medicines as a result we may not control the manner or time schedule in which these clinical trials are conducted which may negatively impact our business operations in addition if any of our strategic collaborators withdraws support for one or more of our programs or proposed products or otherwise impairs their development our business could be negatively affected 

we may seek to establish additional strategic alliances and if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans certain of our strategic alliance agreements may restrict our ability to develop certain products 

our development programs and the potential commercialization of our development candidates and investigational medicines will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses for some of our investigational medicines we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those investigational medicines 

we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators whether we reach a definitive agreement for any additional strategic alliances will depend among other things upon our assessment of the strategic collaborator’s resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed strategic alliance and the proposed strategic collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states the potential market for the subject investigational medicine the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such investigational medicine to trial participants the potential of competing drugs the existence of 

uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally the strategic collaborator may also consider alternative investigational medicines or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our investigational medicine the terms of any additional strategic alliances or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us 

we are also restricted under our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into certain future agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own these restrictions on working with targets polypeptides routes of administration and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with future strategic collaborators or to pursue certain potentially valuable development candidates or investigational medicines 

we may not be able to negotiate additional strategic alliances on a timely basis on favorable terms or at all strategic alliances are complex and timeconsuming to negotiate and document if we are unable to negotiate and enter into new strategic alliances we may have to curtail the development of the investigational medicine for which we are seeking to collaborate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own we may need to obtain additional capital which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all if we do not have sufficient funds we may not be able to further develop our investigational medicines or bring them to market and generate product revenue 

we are dependent on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and the processes required to develop our development candidates and investigational medicines 

we currently depend on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and manufacturing processes required to develop our development candidates and investigational medicines we cannot ensure that these suppliers or service providers will remain in business have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to work with us our use of singlesource suppliers of raw materials components key processes and finished goods exposes us to several risks including disruptions in supply price increases or late deliveries there are in general relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components these vendors may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components materials and processes could take a substantial amount of time and it may be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet regulatory requirements any disruption in supply from any singlesource supplier or service provider could lead to supply delays or interruptions which would damage our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we have to switch to a replacement supplier the manufacture and delivery of our development candidates or investigational medicines could be interrupted for an extended period which could adversely affect our business establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our investigational medicines if required may not be accomplished quickly if we are able to find a replacement supplier the replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval which could result in further delay while we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the singlesource components and materials used in our products any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner could impair our ability to meet the demand for our investigational medicines 

in addition as part of the fda’s approval of our investigational medicines we will also require fda review of the individual components of our process which include the manufacturing processes and facilities of our singlesource suppliers 

our reliance on these suppliers service providers and manufacturers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our reputation business and financial condition including among other things 



 if any of these risks materialize costs could significantly increase and our ability to meet demand for our products could be impacted 

we rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our research preclinical studies protocol development and clinical trials for our development candidates or investigational medicines if these third parties do not perform satisfactorily comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our investigational medicines and our business could be substantially harmed 

we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties such as cros clinical data management organizations medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct certain research and preclinical testing activities in some cases these third parties may terminate their engagements with us if we need to enter into alternative arrangements it would delay our discovery or product development activities 

our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our regulatory or contractual responsibilities we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards for example we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial moreover the fda requires us to comply with regulations commonly referred to as gcps for conducting recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected we also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a governmentsponsored database clinicaltrialsgov within certain timeframes failure to do so can result in fines adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions for any violations of laws and regulations during the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials we could be subject to warning letters or enforcement action that may include civil penalties up to and including criminal prosecution 

we and our cros will be required to comply with regulations including gcps for conducting monitoring recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately informed among other things of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials we also are responsible for ensuring that the rights of our clinical trial participants are protected these regulations are enforced by the fda the competent authorities of the member states of the european economic area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any investigational medicines in clinical development the fda enforces gcp regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors principal investigators and trial sites if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable gcps the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications we cannot assure you that upon inspection the fda will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with gcps in addition our clinical trials must be conducted with investigational medicines produced in accordance with the requirements in cgmp regulations our failure or the failure of our cros to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action 

although we intend to design the clinical trials for certain of our investigational medicines our strategic collaborators will design the clinical trials that they are managing in some cases with our input and in the case of clinical trials controlled by us we expect that cros will conduct all of the clinical trials as a result many important aspects of our development programs including their conduct and timing will be outside of our direct control our reliance on third parties to conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials will also result in less direct control over the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff communicating with outside parties can also potentially lead to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities outside parties may 



 these factors may materially adversely affect the willingness or ability of third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and may subject us to unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control if the cros do not perform preclinical studies and clinical trials in a satisfactory manner breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements the development regulatory approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines may be delayed we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our investigational medicines or our development programs may be materially and irreversibly harmed if we are unable to rely on preclinical and clinical data collected by our cros we could be required to repeat extend the duration of or increase the size of any clinical trials we conduct and this could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures 

we also expect to rely on other third parties to transport store and distribute the required materials for our clinical trials in the past certain of our thirdparty vendors have mishandled our materials resulting in loss of full or partial lots of material any further performance failure on the part of these third parties could result in damaged products and could delay clinical development or marketing approval of any investigational medicines we may develop or commercialization of our medicines if approved producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue causing us to default on our contractual commitments result in losses that are not covered by insurance and damage our reputation and overall perception of our products in the marketplace 

risks related to our intellectual property 

other companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products 

mrna medicines is a relatively new scientific field the continued development and potential use of which has resulted in many different patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain ip protection in the field we have obtained grants and issuances of patents on mrna medicines and our delivery technology the issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in key markets around the world that we own claim many different methods compositions and processes relating to the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of mrna medicines and our delivery technology including lnps 

as the field of mrna therapeutics and vaccines is maturing patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world there is uncertainty about which patents will issue and if they do as to when to whom and with what claims it is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings such as interference reexamination and opposition proceedings as well as  inter partes  and postgrant review proceedings introduced by provisions of the america invents act which became available to thirdparty challengers on september 16 2012 in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mrna field we expect that oppositions will be filed in the european patent office the “epo” and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio in many cases the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents and it may be years before final unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions the timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims for example a third party request for reexamination has been granted against one of our us patents which relates to our infectious disease vaccine program we cannot be certain that such patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form in addition third parties may attempt to invalidate our ip rights even if our rights are not directly challenged disputes could lead to the weakening of our ip rights our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our ip rights could be costly to us could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the field of mrna therapeutics 

there are many issued and pending thirdparty patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide delivery technologies that we may need for our mrna therapeutic and vaccine candidates there are also many issued thirdparty patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for mrna medicines we wish to develop for example we are aware of a thirdparty patent directed to methods of using mrna to treat fabry disease in addition there may be issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party’s belief that we may need such patents for our mrna therapeutic candidates thus it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we may need a license or hold patent rights which could be asserted against us if those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have been asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms we may be unable to perform research and development or other activities or market products covered by such patents 

if we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights we could incur substantial costs and expenses substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts 

our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties there is a substantial amount of litigation both within and outside the united states involving patent and other ip rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including patent infringement lawsuits interferences oppositions  ex parte  reexaminations postgrant review and  inter partes  review proceedings before the us patent and trademark office the “uspto” and corresponding foreign patent offices numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications which are owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates in certain instances we have instituted and may in the future institute  inter partes  review proceedings against issued us patents and opposition proceedings against european patents owned by third parties in the field of mrna medicines we have a number of these proceedings ongoing against thirdparty patents related to rna vaccinations and mrna delivery if we are unsuccessful in invalidating certain of the thirdparty patents that we are currently challenging those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against us should certain of our investigational medicines obtain regulatory approval as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued the risk increases that our development candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties 

third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization there may be thirdparty patents or patent applications with claims to materials formulations methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our investigational medicines because patent applications can take many years to issue there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our investigational medicines may infringe in addition third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our investigational medicines any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself the holders of any such patents may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such investigational medicine unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire similarly if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations processes for manufacture or methods of use including combination therapy the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable investigational medicine unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires in either case such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 

defense of infringement and other claims regardless of their merit would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement pay royalties redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms if at all or may require substantial time and expense 

in addition such licenses are likely to be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us if we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations moreover we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our ip may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior ip positions in the relevant fields which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations 

in addition in connection with certain license and strategic alliance agreements we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to ip rights or the subject matter of the agreements the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to ip rights even if resolved in our favor could be substantial and litigation would divert our management’s efforts some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations 

  

we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary ip rights to product components and manufacturing processes for our development pipeline 

presently we have rights to certain ip through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own to develop our development candidates and investigational medicines because our pipeline may involve additional development candidates that could require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties the growth of our business could depend in part on our ability to acquire inlicense or use these proprietary rights in addition our development candidates and investigational medicines may require specific formulations to work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others we may be unable to acquire or inlicense any compositions methods of use processes or other thirdparty ip rights from third parties that we identify the licensing and acquisition 

of thirdparty ip rights is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire thirdparty ip rights that we may consider attractive these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities 

for example we sometimes collaborate with us and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions typically these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration regardless of such right of first negotiation for ip we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us if we are unable to do so the institution may offer the ip rights to other parties potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program 

in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we also may be unable to license or acquire thirdparty ip rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required thirdparty ip rights our business financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer 

if we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries our ability to effectively compete using our development candidates will be harmed 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other ip laws of the united states and other countries so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information however we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to develop manufacture and commercialize our proposed products 

because certain us patent applications are confidential until the patents issue such as applications filed prior to november 29 2000 or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications for this and other reasons we may be unable to secure desired patent rights thereby losing exclusivity further we may be required to obtain licenses under thirdparty patents to market our proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities if licenses are not available to us on favorable terms we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities 

our strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries in addition we may rely on thirdparty strategic collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly as a part of certain strategic alliances the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming if our present or future strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner our business may be adversely affected despite our efforts and the efforts of our strategic collaborators to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary while issued patents are presumed valid this does not guarantee that the patent will survive a validity challenge or be held enforceable any patents we have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged invalidated adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by parties attempting to design around our ip moreover third parties or the uspto may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications any challenge to finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention of our patents or patent applications would be costly would require significant time and attention of our management could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from thirdparty licensors and could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents the patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies including ours is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations the standards that the uspto and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change similarly the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions including ours in the united states and foreign countries remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices courts and lawmakers moreover there are periodic discussions in the us congress and in international jurisdictions about modifying various aspects of patent law for example the america invents act which took effect in march 2013 included a number of changes to the patent laws of the united states if any of the enacted changes prevent us from adequately protecting our discoveries including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents to obtain injunctive relieve or for substantial damages our business could be adversely affected one major provision of the america invents act changed us patent practice from a firsttoinvent to a firsttofile system if we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor’s filing date and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention there is also no uniform worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents in certain countries for example methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable 

accordingly we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others we also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets knowhow and technology which are not 

protected by patents to maintain our competitive position if any trade secret knowhow or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we license patent rights from thirdparty owners if such owners do not properly or successfully obtain maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we are a party to licenses that give us rights to thirdparty ip that is necessary or useful for our business in particular we have obtained licenses from cellscript llc and its affiliates to patent rights covering modified mrna chemistries and from certain other parties for ip useful in our formulation efforts we may enter into additional licenses to thirdparty ip in the future 

our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed ip our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications we license even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications our licensors may fail to maintain these patents may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would without protection for the ip we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects in addition we sublicense our rights under various thirdparty licenses to our strategic collaborators any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our strategic alliance agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our strategic collaborators 

if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license ip rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

licensing of ip is important to our business and involves complex legal business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry we are a party to certain ip license agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future our existing license agreements impose and we expect that future license agreements will impose various diligence milestone payment royalty and other obligations on us if we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or we are subject to a bankruptcy the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license 

in some cases patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor if our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary ip we license from them we could lose our rights to the ip and our competitors could market competing products using the ip in certain cases we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology in the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution we may incur significant liability to our strategic collaborators disputes may arise regarding ip subject to a licensing agreement including 

 if disputes over ip that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected development candidates or investigational medicines we are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of ip that we license as we are for ip that we own which are described below if we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this ip our ability to commercialize products could suffer 

  

if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position would be harmed 

in addition to patent protection we rely heavily upon knowhow and trade secret protection as well as nondisclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and third parties to protect our confidential and proprietary information especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable in addition to contractual measures we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures such measures may not for example in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access provide 

adequate protection for our proprietary information our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult expensive and timeconsuming and the outcome is unpredictable in addition trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us if any of our confidential or proprietary information such as our trade secrets were to be disclosed or misappropriated or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor our competitive position could be harmed 

certain former employees have obtained employment with companies or academic institutions that could be considered competitive with us and are operating their business in areas that are similar to ours including in their business model product discovery efforts mrnabased product development or formulation technology such as our lnps this competition may be limited by contractual provisions which may or may not be enforceable by us in the commonwealth of massachusetts or other jurisdictions in addition we may not be aware of such competitive employment arrangements until after our trade secrets have been disclosed to potentially competitive companies 

we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 

we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors although we try to ensure that our employees consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or knowhow of others in their work for us from time to time we are subject to claims that we or our employees consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed ip including trade secrets or other proprietary information of any of our employees’ former employers or other third parties litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights or personnel which could adversely impact our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other ip 

we may be subject to claims that former employees collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other ip ownership disputes may arise for example from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our development candidates litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights such as exclusive ownership of or right to use valuable ip such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

  

obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements 

periodic maintenance fees renewal fees annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents or applications will be due to be paid to the uspto and various governmental patent agencies outside of the united states in several stages over the lifetime of the patents or applications we have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to nonus patent agencies the uspto and various nonus governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules however there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction in such an event our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance could have a material adverse impact on our business 

issued patents covering our development candidates and investigational medicines could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court 

if we or one of our strategic collaborators initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our development candidates or investigational medicines the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our development candidate or investigational medicine is invalid or unenforceable in patent litigation in the united states defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of 

several statutory requirements including patent eligible subject matter lack of novelty obviousness or nonenablement grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the uspto or made a misleading statement during prosecution third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the united states or abroad even outside the context of litigation such mechanisms include reexamination postgrant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions eg opposition proceedings such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our development candidates or investigational medicines the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable with respect to the validity question for example there may be invalidating prior art that we and the patent examiner were unaware of during prosecution if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity andor unenforceability we would lose at least part of the patent protection for our development candidates and investigational medicines such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business 

changes in us patent law could diminish the value of patents in general thereby impairing our ability to protect our products 

as is the case with other biotechnology companies our success is heavily dependent on ip particularly patents obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity and therefore obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly timeconsuming and inherently uncertain in addition the united states has recently enacted and is currently implementing wideranging patent reform legislation recent us supreme court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained depending on decisions by the us congress the federal courts and the uspto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future 

  

we may not be able to protect our ip rights throughout the world 

filing prosecuting and defending patents on development candidates and investigational medicines in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our ip rights in some countries outside the united states can be less extensive than those in the united states in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ip rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the united states consequently we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the united states or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the united states or other jurisdictions competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the united states these products may compete with our products and our patents or other ip rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing 

many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending ip rights in foreign jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other ip protection particularly those relating to biotechnology products which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our ip rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the ip that we develop or license 

our reliance on government funding and collaboration from government and quasigovernmental entities for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of development commercialization and production of any programs developed under those governmentfunded programs 

the development of each of our zika vaccine mrna1893 our antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 and our chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 are currently being funded through subcontracts with funding from either the biomedical advanced research and development authority “barda” or defense advanced research projects agency “darpa” our sarscov2 vaccine mrna1273 is being developed in collaboration with niaid and niaid plans to conduct indenabling studies and a phase 1 clinical study of mrna1273 in the united states cepi has agreed to fund the manufacture of the preliminary clinical batches of the mrna1273 contracts and grants funded by the us government and its agencies including our agreements funded by barda and darpa and our collaboration with niaid include provisions that reflect the government’s substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts including powers of the government to 



 we may not have the right to prohibit the us government from using certain technologies developed by us and we may not be able to prohibit thirdparty companies including our competitors from using those technologies in providing products and services to the us government the us government generally takes the position that it has the right to royaltyfree use of technologies that are developed under us government contracts 

in addition government contracts and grants and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions these requirements include for example 

 

further under these agreements we are subject to the obligations to and the rights of the us government set forth in the bayhdole act of 1980 the “bayhdole act” as a result the us government may have rights in certain inventions developed under these governmentfunded programs including a nonexclusive nontransferable irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any governmental purpose in addition the us government has the right to require us to grant exclusive partially exclusive or nonexclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party if it determines that i adequate steps have not been taken to commercialize the invention ii government action is necessary to meet public health or safety needs or iii government action is necessary to meet requirements for public use under federal regulations also referred to as “marchin rights” while the us government has sparingly used and to our knowledge never successfully exercised such marchin rights any exercise of the marchin rights by the us government could harm our competitive position business financial condition results of operations and prospects if the us government exercises such marchin rights we may receive compensation that is deemed reasonable by the us government in its sole discretion which may be less than what we might be able to obtain in the open market intellectual property generated under a government funded program is also subject to certain reporting requirements compliance with which may require us to expend substantial resources 

in addition the us government requires that any products embodying any invention generated through the use of us government funding be manufactured substantially in the united states the manufacturing preference requirement can be waived if the owner of the intellectual property can show that reasonable but unsuccessful efforts have been made to grant licenses on similar terms to potential licensees that would be likely to manufacture substantially in the united states or that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible this preference for us manufacturers may limit our ability to contract with nonus manufacturers for products covered by such intellectual property 

as an organization we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails if we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts 

as a us government contractor we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the us government of our costs and performance on their contracts as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts based on the results of its audits the government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs although adjustments arising from government audits and reviews have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past we cannot assure you that future audits and reviews will not have those effects 

cepi is a global organization that has publicly stated its intent to work with multiple global organizations on potential vaccines and therapies targeting the novel coronavirus including other companies working on mrna based approaches there is a possibility that our confidential information may become exposed to others during this process including the details and timing of our vaccine efforts 

risks related to commercialization of our pipeline 

we have no sales distribution or marketing experience and may invest significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities if we are unable to establish such capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our future products if approved we may be unable to generate any revenues 

given our stage of development we have no sales distribution or marketing experience to successfully commercialize any products that may result from our development programs we will need to develop sales and marketing capabilities in the united states europe or other regions either on our own or with others we may enter into strategic alliances with other entities to utilize their mature marketing and distribution capabilities but we may be unable to enter into marketing agreements on favorable terms if at all if our future strategic collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products if any and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business we will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and wellfunded marketing and sales operations without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products new treatment methods and new technologies we may be unable to commercialize successfully any products that we develop 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel products for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target many of our competitors have 

 we will face intense competition from products that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of the conditions for which we may develop products we also expect to face competition from new products that enter the market there are a number of products currently under development which may become commercially available in the future for the treatment of conditions for which we are trying or may in the future try to develop products these products may be more effective safer less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we develop 

we anticipate competing with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world many of which are all currently conducting research in the fields of infectious diseases immunooncology rare genetic diseases and cancer vaccines some of these companies have greater financial and human resources than we currently have in addition to these large pharmaceutical companies we may directly compete with fullyintegrated biopharmaceutical companies and other immunotherapyfocused oncology companies as well as a 

number of companies focused on mrna medicines or shared tumor antigen and neoantigen therapeutics some of which have entered into collaboration and funding agreements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 

if we successfully develop investigational medicines and obtain approval for them we will face competition based on many different factors including 

 our competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors in addition our competitors may develop strategic alliances with or receive funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies providing them with an advantage over us our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are which could adversely affect our competitive position and business competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our products if approved 

the commercial success of any current or future investigational medicine if approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community 

ethical social and legal concerns about genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use even with the requisite approvals the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the medical community patients and thirdparty or governmental payors accepting mrna medicines in general and our products in particular as medically useful costeffective and safe any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians trial participants thirdparty payors and others in the medical community if these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable the degree of market acceptance of our investigational medicines if approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors including 

 even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical studies market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched our efforts to educate the medical community and thirdparty payors on the benefits of the products may require significant resources and may never be successful our efforts to educate the marketplace may 

require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors due to the complexity and uniqueness of our programs 

even if we are successful in obtaining marketing approval for any product commercial success of any approved products will also depend in large part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors including government payors such as the medicare and medicaid programs and entry into managed care organizations which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of healthcare thirdparty payors could require us to conduct additional studies including postmarketing studies related to the cost effectiveness of a product to qualify for reimbursement which could be costly and divert our resources if government and other healthcare payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for any of our products once approved whether due to healthcare reform legislation or otherwise market acceptance and commercial success would be reduced 

in addition if any of our products are approved for marketing we or a strategic collaborator will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other postmarketing information and reports for such product and will need to continue to comply or ensure that our thirdparty providers comply with cgmp and current gcps for any clinical trials that we or a strategic collaborator conduct postapproval in addition there is always the risk that we or a strategic collaborator or regulatory authority might identify previously unknown problems with a product postapproval such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency compliance with these requirements is costly and any such failure to comply or other issues with our investigational medicines identified postapproval could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may market our products outside of the united states and we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

because we plan to market our products if approved outside of the united states our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including an increase in our expenses diversion of our management’s attention from the acquisition or development of investigational medicines or forgoing profitable licensing opportunities in these geographies accordingly our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including 

 in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements in the united states and abroad we are subject to extensive additional federal state and foreign antibribery regulations which include the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws in other countries outside of the united states we are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry for companies similar to ours but we cannot guarantee that we our employees our consultants or our thirdparty contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption moreover our strategic collaborators and thirdparty contractors located outside the united states may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate even if we are not determined to have violated these laws government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity which could also have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newlyapproved products particularly in a new class of medicines is uncertain failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue 

the availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments such as the medicines that we hope to develop and sell adequate coverage and reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid and commercial payors is critical to new product acceptance in 

addition because our personalized cancer vaccine and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer we cannot accurately estimate how these products would be priced whether reimbursement could be obtained or any potential revenue sales of our investigational medicines will depend substantially both domestically and abroad on the extent to which the costs of our investigational medicines will be paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels we may not be able to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment in any of our products 

there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products including genetic medicines and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the medicine is approved by the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the united states the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the centers for medicare  medicaid services “cms” an agency within the us department of health and human services “hhs” as cms decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under medicare private payors tend to follow cms to a substantial degree it is difficult to predict what cms will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours reimbursement agencies in europe may be more conservative than cms for example a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the united states and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain european countries 

outside the united states certain countries including a number of member states of the eu set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the eu with limited participation from the marketing authorization holders we cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic collaborators if the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement levels that are not commercially attractive for us or our strategic collaborators our revenues from sales by us or our strategic collaborators and the potential profitability of our drug products in those countries would be negatively affected an increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing costcutting efforts on pharmaceuticals for their staterun healthcare systems these international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world but have been most drastic in the eu additionally some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed in many countries the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted as a result we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country but then may experience delays in the reimbursement approval of our product or be subject to price regulations that would delay our commercial launch of the product possibly for lengthy time periods which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country 

moreover increasing efforts by governmental and thirdparty payors in the united states and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and as a result they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our investigational medicines for example the us government recently released a “blueprint” or plan to reduce the cost of drugs this blueprint contains certain measures that the hhs is already working to implement for example in may 2019 cms issued a final rule that amends the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs among other things the final rule now allows medicare advantage plans the option to use step therapy a type of preauthorization for part b drugs beginning january 1 2020 this final rule codified cms’s policy change that was effective january 1 2019 at the state level legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts or restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures which in some cases are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our investigational medicines due to the trend toward managed healthcare the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments has become very intense as a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products 

recent federal legislation and actions by state and local governments may permit reimportation of drugs from foreign countries into the united states including foreign countries where the drugs are sold at lower prices than in the united states which could materially adversely affect our operating results 

we may face competition in the united states for our product candidates if approved from therapies sourced from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products in the united states the medicare modernization act contains provisions that may change us importation laws and expand pharmacists’ and wholesalers’ ability to import cheaper versions of an approved drug and competing products from canada where there are government price controls these changes to us importation laws will not take effect unless and until the secretary of the hhs certifies that the changes will pose no additional risk to the public’s health 

and safety and will result in a significant reduction in the cost of products to consumers on december 18 2019 fda issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that if finalized would allow for the importation of certain prescription drugs from canada the secretary of hhs would make the above certification to congress upon issuance of a final rule based on this proposal fda also issued a draft guidance document outlining a potential pathway for manufacturers to obtain an additional national drug code or ndc for an fdaapproved drug that was originally intended to be marketed in a foreign country and that was authorized for sale in that foreign country the regulatory and market implications of the notice of proposed rulemaking and draft guidance are unknown at this time proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow reimportation under certain circumstances legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of drugs if enacted could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop and adversely affect our future revenues and prospects for profitability 

healthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business 

in the united states there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs for example in march 2010 the aca was passed which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical industry the aca among other things increased the minimum medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and promoted a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program considerable uncertainty remains regarding the implementation and impact of the aca 

since its enactment there have been numerous judicial administrative executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the aca and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the aca in the future for example various portions of the aca are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the fifth circuit court and the united states supreme court and the trump administration has issued various executive orders which eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices additionally congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the aca it is unclear whether the aca will be overturned repealed replaced or further amended we cannot predict what affect further changes to the aca would have on our business 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things created measures for spending reductions by the us congress a joint select committee on deficit reduction tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 was unable to reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions of medicare payments to providers up to 2 per fiscal year these reductions will remain in effect through 2029 unless additional congressional action is taken 

further legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand postapproval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products we cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether fda regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals if any of our development candidates may be in addition increased scrutiny by the us congress of the fda’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and postmarketing conditions and other requirements 

the delivery of healthcare in the eu including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines is almost exclusively a matter for national rather than eu law and policy national governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context in general however the healthcare budgetary constraints in most eu member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers coupled with everincreasing eu and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval 

we expect that additional foreign state and federal healthcare reform measures or proposals will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our investigational medicines or additional pricing pressures in the event that the pricing structures for healthcare products such as the investigational medicines we are developing change materially and limit payments for such investigational medicines our business will be adversely impacted as our products may no longer be commercially viable based on their expected net present value we may have invested significant resources in products that cannot be commercially developed or we may determine 

that assets that have reached an early phase of development cannot or will not be taken into further development notwithstanding their clinical viability in addition development assets or clinical programs that are part of our strategic alliances may no longer be deemed commercially viable to pursue based on our strategic collaborators’ assessments of the impact of any proposed announced or legislated pricing reforms 

we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future further federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from investigational medicines that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop investigational medicines 

due to the novel nature of our technology we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement for these investigational medicines 

target patient populations for certain of our investigational medicines such as those for rare genetic diseases may be relatively small and certain of our investigational medicines like pcv require customization on an individual scale as a result the pricing and reimbursement of our investigational medicines if approved must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure if we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement our ability to successfully market and sell our investigational medicines will be adversely affected the manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our investigational medicines eg for administration of our product to patients is also important inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products 

if the market opportunities for our development candidates or investigational medicines are smaller than we believe they are our revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer because the target patient populations for some of our programs are small we must be able to successfully identify clinical trial participants and achieve a significant market share to maintain profitability and growth 

an important area of focus of our research and product development activities is the development of treatments for severe rare genetic diseases our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our programs are based on estimates these estimates have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature surveys of clinics patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect further new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases the number of clinical trial participants in the united states europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected potential clinical trial participants may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products or new clinical trial participants may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business 

the market opportunities of some of our programs may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and for which the market opportunities may be small 

the fda often approves new therapies initially only for use by patients with relapsed or refractory advanced disease we expect to initially seek approval of our pcv and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines in this context subsequently for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial if any we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy but there is no guarantee that our investigational medicines even if approved would be approved for earlier lines of therapy and prior to any such approvals we may have to conduct additional clinical trials 

our projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we may be targeting as well as the subset of people with these cancers in a position to receive second or third line therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our investigational medicines are based on our beliefs and estimates these estimates have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature surveys of clinics patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect further new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers the number of trial participants may turn out to be lower than expected additionally the potentially addressable patient population for our investigational medicines may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our investigational medicines even if we obtain significant market share for our products if approved because the potential target populations are small we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications 

  

risks related to our business and operations 

we will need to develop and expand our company and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion which could disrupt our operations 

we have approximately 830 fulltime employees and in connection with the growth and advancement of our pipeline and operating as a public company we expect to increase the number of employees and the scope of our operations to manage our anticipated 

development and expansion including expansion outside of the united states we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel also our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its daytoday activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities 

as a growing biotechnology company we are actively pursuing development candidates and investigational medicines in many therapeutic areas and across a wide range of diseases successfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory and manufacturing pathways to all of these therapeutic areas and disease states requires a significant depth of talent resources and corporate processes in order to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas due to our limited resources and early stage of growth we may not be able to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel this may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure give rise to operational mistakes loss of business opportunities loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees the physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of our investigational medicines if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion our expenses may increase more than expected our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our investigational medicines if approved and compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company 

our future success depends on our ability to retain key employees consultants and advisors and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we may not be able to retain employees or executives who have vested stock options 

our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial scientific and medical personnel we are highly dependent upon members of our management and scientific teams each of our executive officers and all of our employees including key scientists and clinicians are employed “at will” meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time the loss of any of these persons’ services may adversely impact the achievement of our research development financing and commercialization objectives we currently do not have “key person” insurance on any of our employees many of our key employees including members of our executive team have been with us for a long period of time and have valuable fully vested stock options or other longterm equity incentives we may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry particularly in cambridge massachusetts 

in addition we rely on consultants contractors and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development regulatory approval and commercialization strategy our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us the loss of the services of one or more of our current employees or advisors might impede the achievement of our research development regulatory approval and commercialization objectives in addition we have flexibly grown our workforce through the use of contractors and part time workers we may not be able to retain the services of such personnel which might result in delays in the operation of our business 

recruiting and retaining other qualified employees consultants and advisors for our business including scientific and technical personnel also will be critical to our success competition for skilled personnel including in mrna and lnp research clinical operations regulatory affairs therapeutic area management and manufacturing is intense and the turnover rate can be high we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on favorable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for individuals with similar skill sets in addition adverse publicity failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel the inability to recruit or loss of services of certain executives key employees consultants or advisors may impede the progress of our research development and commercialization objectives and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our employees principal investigators and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading 

we are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees principal investigators and consultants misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations or the regulations applicable in the eu and other jurisdictions provide accurate information to the fda the ema and other regulatory authorities comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the united states and abroad or report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the fda or other regulatory authorities which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other 

business arrangements we have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 

employee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business 

our employees may from time to time bring lawsuits against us regarding injury creating a hostile work place discrimination wage and hour disputes sexual harassment or other employment issues in recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses certain companies that have faced employment or harassmentrelated lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business if we were to face any employmentrelated claims our business could be negatively affected 

we have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable 

our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability alone or with strategic collaborators to successfully complete the development of and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our investigational medicines we do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future if ever our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in 

 even if one or more of the investigational medicines that we develop is approved for commercial sale we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved investigational medicine our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the fda the ema or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical and other studies or make changes to our manufacturing or quality systems in addition to those that we currently anticipate even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations 

our internal computer systems or those of our strategic collaborators or other contractors or consultants may fail or suffer security breaches which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and our manufacturing operations 

our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators vendors and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses unauthorized access natural disasters terrorism cybersecurity threats war and telecommunication and electrical failures while we have not experienced any such material system failure accident or security breach to date that we are aware of if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions for example the loss of clinical trial data from one or more ongoing or completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data in addition because of our approach to running multiple clinical trials in parallel any breach of our computer systems may result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across many of our programs in many stages of development any such breach loss or compromise of clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties either under the general data protection regulation “gdpr” and relevant member state law in the eu other foreign laws and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 “hipaa” and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the united states to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our investigational medicines could be delayed 

we may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or investigational medicine and fail to capitalize on programs or investigational medicines that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success 

because we have limited resources we must choose to pursue and fund the development of selected research programs or investigational medicines and may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other programs or investigational medicines that could later prove to have greater commercial potential our resource allocation decisions or our contractual commitments to provide resources to our strategic collaborators under strategic alliance agreements may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities our spending on current and future research and development programs for investigational medicines may not yield any commercially viable products if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular investigational medicine we may relinquish valuable rights to that investigational medicine through a strategic alliance licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such investigational medicine or we may allocate internal resources to an investigational medicine in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a strategic alliance 

if we are not successful in discovering developing and commercializing additional products beyond our current portfolio our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired 

although a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the clinical trials and potential approval of our existing investigational medicines a key element of our strategy is to discover develop and potentially commercialize additional products beyond our current portfolio to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas we intend to do so by investing in our own drug discovery efforts exploring potential strategic alliances for the development of new products and inlicensing technologies identifying new investigational medicines requires substantial technical financial and human resources whether or not any investigational medicines are ultimately identified even if we identify investigational medicines that initially show promise we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize such products for many reasons including the following 

 if we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional products our potential for growth may be impaired 

product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any investigational medicine that we may develop 

we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of any of our current or future investigational medicines in clinical trials and we may face an even greater risk if we commercialize any investigational medicine that we may develop if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our investigational medicines caused injuries we could incur substantial liabilities regardless of merit or eventual outcome liability claims may result in 

 we carry product liability insurance which we believe to be sufficient in light of our current clinical programs however we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability if and when we obtain marketing approval for investigational medicines we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products however we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in adequate amounts on occasion large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and if judgments exceed our insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and business 

we may be subject directly or indirectly to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws if we are unable to comply or have not fully complied with such laws we could face substantial penalties 

if we obtain fda approval for any of our investigational medicines and begin commercializing those products in the united states our operations will be directly or indirectly through our prescribers customers and purchasers subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations including without limitation the federal health care program antikickback statute the federal civil and criminal false claims act and physician payments sunshine act and regulations these laws will impact among other things our proposed sales marketing and educational programs in addition we may be subject to patient privacy laws enacted by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business the laws that will affect our operations include but are not limited to the following 



payors may also be liable under the false claims act for the direct submission of such claims the false claims act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the false claims act and to share in any monetary recovery the aca provides and recent government cases against pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers support the view that federal antikickback statute violations and certain marketing practices including offlabel promotion may implicate the false claims act 

 

 

 

 

 

the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the eu the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national antibribery laws of eu member states such as the uk bribery act 2010 infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment 

payments made to physicians in certain eu member states must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization or the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

the collection and use of personal health data in the eu had previously been governed by the provisions of the data protection directive which has been replaced by the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 while the data protection directive did 

not apply to organizations based outside the eu the gdpr has expanded its reach to include any business regardless of its location that provides goods or services to residents in the eu this expansion would incorporate our clinical trial activities in eu member states the gdpr imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the eu gdpr grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated further the gdpr imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu to the united states or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections failure to comply with the requirements of the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the eu member states which may deviate slightly from the gdpr may result in significant fines as a result of the implementation of the gdpr we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules 

there is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with gdpr for example it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the eu or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring gdpr compliance may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business 

we are subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials our operations also may produce hazardous waste products we generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes we will not be able to eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials 

in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these current or future laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 

unfavorable us or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets the most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the most recent global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including weakened demand for our investigational medicines and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on favorable terms if at all a weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers possibly resulting in supply disruption or cause delays in payments for our services by thirdparty payors or our collaborators any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business 

we or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other business interruptions such as cybersecurity attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster 

natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects if a natural disaster power outage cybersecurity attack or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters damaged critical infrastructure such as our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers limited our ability to access or use our digital information systems or that otherwise disrupted operations it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time the disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event cybersecurity liability insurance is difficult to obtain and may not cover any damages we would sustain based on any breach of our computer security protocols or other cybersecurity attack we may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if our products become subject to a product recall it could harm our reputation business and financial results 

the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of certain commercialized products in the case of the fda the authority to require a recall of a biologic product must be based on an fda finding that a batch lot of other quantity of the biologic product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health in addition foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of any investigational medicine in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture manufacturers may under their own initiative recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found a governmentmandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing errors design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues recalls of any of our investigational medicines would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales if any 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

as of december 31 2019  we had approximately 126 billion  in cash cash equivalents and investments these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks we may realize losses in the fair value of these investments which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements in addition should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us our interest income would suffer the market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

changes in tax law could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

the rules dealing with us federal state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the internal revenue service and the us treasury department changes to tax laws which changes may have retroactive application could adversely affect us or holders of our common stock in recent years many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on our business cash flow financial condition or results of operations we urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of potential changes in tax laws on an investment in our common stock 

if the estimates we make or the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we cannot assure you however that our estimates or the assumptions underlying them will be correct 

the amount of and our ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations and uncertainty 

as of december 31 2019  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 9818 million  and 9788 million  respectively a portion of which will begin to expire in 2030 as of december 31 2019  we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of 456 million  and 239 million  respectively which begin to expire in 2030  and 2029  resepectively these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities while federal net operating losses generated after december 31 2018 will not be subject to expiration the deduction for such net operating loss in any taxable year will be limited to 80 of our taxable income in such year where taxable income is determined without regard to the net operating loss deduction itself in general under sections 382 and 383 of the code a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses or tax credits “nols” or credits to offset future taxable income or taxes for these purposes an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5 of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period as of december 31 2019  none of our nols or credits will expire due to sections 382 and 383 however future changes in our stock ownership many of which are outside of our control could result in an ownership change under sections 382 and 383 of the code and limit our ability to utilize our nols and credits our nols or credits may also be impaired under state law accordingly we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our nols or credits in addition the rules regarding timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax purposes in connection with various transactions we have are complex and uncertain in various respects and could be subject to challenge by taxing authorities in the event any such challenge is sustained the net operating losses could be materially reduced andor we could be determined to be a material cash taxpayer for one or more years furthermore our ability to utilize our nols or credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating us federal and state taxable income as described above we have 

incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and therefore we do not know whether or when we will generate the us federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our nol or credit carryforwards 

if we engage in future acquisitions joint ventures or strategic collaborations this may increase our capital requirements dilute our stockholders cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 

 in addition if we undertake acquisitions we may utilize our cash issue dilutive securities assume or incur debt obligations incur large onetime expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense 

moreover we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business 

the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges 

social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research development candidates investigational medicines and the diseases our development candidates and investigational medicines are being developed to treat social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear this evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business resulting in potential regulatory actions against us for example patients may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical study or to report an alleged adverse event when such disclosures occur there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our development candidates and investigational medicines there is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations we could incur liability face regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 

our stock price has been and in the future may be subject to substantial volatility for example our stock traded within a range of a high price of 2834 and a low price of 1226 per share for the period of december 7 2018 our first day of trading on the nasdaq global select market through february 20 2020 as a result of this volatility our stockholders could incur substantial losses 

the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies as a result of this volatility you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price the market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors including 

 if our quarterly or annual results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially furthermore any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results may in turn cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

in addition public statements by us government agencies the media or others relating to the coronavirus outbreak including regarding efforts to develop a coronavirus vaccine have in the past resulted and may in the future result in significant fluctuations in our stock price given the global focus on the coronavirus outbreak any information in the public arena on this topic whether or not accurate could have an outsized impact either positive or negative on our stock price 

in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities classaction litigation often has been instituted against that company such litigation if instituted against us could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management’s attention and resources which could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we have broad discretion in the use of our cash cash equivalents and investments and may not use them effectively 

our management will have broad discretion in the application of our cash cash equivalents and investments and could spend the proceeds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock the failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse impact on our business cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our investigational medicines pending their use we may invest our cash cash equivalents and investments in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value 

we have incurred and will continue to incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives we are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared 

as a public company we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in addition the federal securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies including requirements to file annual quarterly and event driven reports with respect to our business and financial condition and to establish and maintain effective 

disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly for example these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may not be able to produce reliable financial statements or file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the sec or comply with the nasdaq listing requirements in addition we could make errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 “section 404” we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm however while we were an “emerging growth company” as defined in the jumpstart our business startups act our auditors were not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year ended december 31 2019 we qualified as a “large accelerated filer” as defined in the securities exchange act of 1934 as amended the “exchange act” and as a result ceased to qualify as an emerging growth company accordingly commencing with our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december 31 2019 we are required to have our auditors formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section 404 our compliance with section 404 necessitates that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management efforts we will continue to dedicate internal resources potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by section 404 this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the “doddfrank act” was enacted there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the doddfrank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as “say on pay” and proxy access our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 

we are in the early stages of developing our policies and practices regarding preapproval access and any policy we develop and implement may result in a negative perception of our company and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as we advance our pipeline patients and their physicians have sought access to our investigational medicines outside of sponsored clinical trials and prior to regulatory approval while we will continue to review and respond to these early access requests at this stage in our development of a new class of medicines we are not providing access to our investigational medicines outside of the clinical trial setting as our development programs progress further we will continue our dialogue with patients and their families advocacy leaders physicians and others on this and other topics we will post our preapproval access policies in accordance with regulatory guidelines 

as a general matter we do not currently plan on providing forwardlooking guidance regarding the expected timing of milestones in our business we plan to report on the status of our programs including the achievement of milestones and related data on a retrospective basis or as otherwise required by us federal securities laws applicable to us which may lead to speculation about our prospects that could have a material adverse effect on our business if we do provide forwardlooking guidance on the expected timing of milestones we may not meet those timelines which may have a material averse effect on our business 

we believe the early stage nature of most of our portfolio is not suitable to providing forwardlooking guidance on the expected timing of individual program milestones particularly data readout timing while as a general matter we intend to periodically report on the status of our development programs including articulating anticipated next steps in the form of development plans or potential data readouts for the majority of our programs we do not currently plan to provide forwardlooking guidance on the timing of those next steps we have provided forward looking guidance as to the expected timing of certain milestones and clinical steps in our cmv program our most advanced clinical program if we are unable to meet the timelines established in this guidance our business may be materially and adversely impacted particularly due to delays in the cmv program in addition we do not control the timing of disclosure of any such milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators any disclosure by our strategic collaborators of data that is perceived as negative whether or not such data are related to other data that we or others release may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or overall valuation not providing forwardlooking guidance on the expected timing of program milestones may lead to speculation by investors shareholders analysts and other market participants and in the media as to the progress of our individual development candidates investigational medicines or our programs as a whole which may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or valuation in the event that we do choose to provide forward looking guidance on the expected timing of milestones in our business we may be required to later update any movement in the timing of such milestones including delays which may have the effect of investors speculating in our stock or otherwise have a material adverse 

impact on our business the ability to predict with accuracy the timing of clinical readouts or progress in clinical trials is difficult and subject to change based on many factors most of which are out of our control including other risks and uncertainties included in this prospectus supplement 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time subject to certain restrictions described below these sales or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our common stock 

the holders of up to 616 million shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for shares held by affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

additionally the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2018 stock option and incentive plan automatically increased on january 1 2020 and will automatically increase each january 1 thereafter by 4 of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding december 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by our compensation committee unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year our stockholders may experience additional dilution 

in addition certain of our employees executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into rule 10b51 trading plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time under a rule 10b51 trading plan a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee director or officer when entering into the plan without further direction from the employee officer or director a rule 10b51 trading plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances our employees executive officers and directors also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a rule 10b51 trading plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information 

raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or development candidates or investigational medicines 

we may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings debt financings strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire or license ip rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise additional funds through collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties or through asset sales we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or development candidates or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock the price of our stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price may decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

our executive officers directors five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 408 of our outstanding common stock therefore these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions for example these stockholders acting together may be able to exert significant influence over matters such as elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that 

 these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us 

any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained 

our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on december 7 2018 given the limited trading history of our common stock there is a risk that an active trading market for our shares will not be sustained which could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and thereby affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares 

because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future capital appreciation if any will be your sole source of gain 

we do not currently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business in addition the terms of any future debt agreements may preclude us from paying dividends as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware or the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us 

pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf 2 any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or 

former directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders 3 any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors officers employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our amended and restated bylaws or 4 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine the “delaware forum provision” the delaware forum provision will not apply to any causes of action arising under the securities act or the exchange act our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the united states district court for the district of massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act the “federal forum provision” we have chosen the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in cambridge ma in addition our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the delaware forum provision and the federal forum provision provided however that stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder 

on december 19 2018 in sciabacucchi v salzberg  ca no 20170931jtl del ch the court of chancery of the state of delaware issued a decision declaring that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the securities act be brought in federal court are ineffective and invalid under delaware law on august 5 2019 the decision was appealed to the delaware supreme court and the appeal remains pending unless and until the court of chancery’s decision in sciabacucchi  is reversed by the delaware supreme court or otherwise abrogated we do not intend to enforce our federal forum provision designating the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for securities act claims in the event that the delaware supreme court affirms the court of chancery’s sciabacucchi decision or otherwise determines that federal forum provisions are invalid our board of directors intends to promptly amend our amended and restated bylaws to remove our federal forum provision 

as a result of the court of chancery’s decision or a decision by the delaware supreme court affirming the court of chancery’s decision or if the federal forum provision is otherwise found inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we recognize that the delaware forum provision and the federal forum provision may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders in pursuing any such claims particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the state of delaware or the commonwealth of massachusetts as applicable additionally the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors officers or employees which may discourage the filing of lawsuits against us and our directors officers and employees even though an action if successful might benefit our stockholders the court of chancery of the state of delaware and the united states district court for the district of massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as a result of many factors including those factors set forth in the “risk factors” section of this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 

overview 

we are a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger rna mrna therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of transformative medicines to improve the lives of patients mrna medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular membrane or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mrna science delivery technology and manufacturing providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates we are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular diseases independently and with our strategic collaborators 

we have designed our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mrna over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases we built and continue to invest in a platform to advance the technological frontier of mrna medicines we have made forward investments in scalable infrastructure and capabilities to pursue a pipeline of potential medicines that reflect the breadth of the mrna opportunity we have a diverse development pipeline of 24  development candidates across our 23  programs of which 12  are in clinical studies we have established strategic alliances with leading biopharmaceutical companies including astrazeneca merck  co or merck and vertex pharmaceuticals or vertex as well as governmentsponsored and private organizations focused on global health initiatives including biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda defense advanced research projects agency or darpa the bill  melinda gates foundation or gates foundation and the coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations or cepi as we unlock the inherent advantages of mrna we aim to address as many diseases and impact as many patients as our technology talent and capital permit 

the broad potential applications of mrna medicines have led us to raise significant capital and adopt a longterm approach to capital allocation that balances nearterm risks and longterm value creation as of december 31 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and investments of approximately 126 billion  in addition in february 2020 we raised approximately 5499 million net of underwriting discounts commissions and estimated offering expenses through a followon public equity offering and the subsequent exercise of the underwriters option to purchase additional shares we use this capital to fund operations and investing activities across research for technology creation drug discovery and clinical development programs infrastructure and capabilities to enable the research engine and early development engine which includes our moderna technology center or mtc manufacturing facility in norwood our digital infrastructure creation of our portfolio of intellectual property and administrative support 

since our inception we have incurred significant operating losses our net losses were 5140 million  3847 million  and 2559 million  for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively as of december 31 2019  our accumulated deficit was 150 billion  we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future in addition we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as we 

 

we do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of potential mrna medicines unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our investigational medicines if we seek to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any of our investigational medicines we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses 

as a result we will need substantial additional funding to support our continued operations and pursue our growth strategy until we can generate significant revenue from sales of our medicines if ever we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings structured financings and debt financings government funding arrangements strategic alliances and marketing distribution and licensing arrangements we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements on favorable terms or at all if we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our programs 

because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical development we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our medicines we may not become profitable if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations 

financial operations overview 

revenue 

to date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of potential mrna medicines our revenue has been primarily derived from strategic alliances with strategic collaborators and governmentsponsored and private organizations to discover develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines 

the following is a summary of revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  in thousands 



 

 total revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  was 602 million  1351 million  and 2058 million  respectively cash received from strategic alliances was 229 million  576 million and 431 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively the timing of revenue recognition is not directly correlated to the timing of cash receipts total deferred revenue related to our strategic alliances as of december 31 2019  and 2018  was 2023 million  and 2744 million  respectively 

the following table summarizes collaboration revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  in thousands 



collaboration revenue for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  was generated primarily from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca merck vertex and alexion our arrangements with alexion were terminated in october 2017 and all rights to mrna researched developed or supplied as part of the programs with alexion reverted to us 

grant revenue is generated primarily from contracts with darpa barda and gates foundation to develop mrna medicines 

for further information on our revenue recognition policies see the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates  revenue recognition ” 

our ability to generate revenue from sales of mrna medicines and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize mrna medicines for the foreseeable future we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales to the extent that existing or potential future strategic alliances generate revenue our revenue may vary due to many uncertainties in the development of our mrna medicines under these strategic alliances and other factors we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development efforts we expect our programs to mature and advance to later stage clinical development and we expect expenses to increase as we seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines and begin to commercialize any approved mrna medicines 

research and development expenses 

the nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following 

 the costs above comprise the following categories 

 we use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform and for discovering and developing programs due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are not recorded or maintained on a program or modalityspecific basis 

the following table reflects our research and development expenses including direct program specific expenses summarized by modality and indirect or shared operating costs summarized under other research and development expenses during the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  in thousands 



 

 a  “modality”  refers to a group of programs with common product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes the programspecific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs which consist primarily of external costs such as fees paid to outside consultants central laboratories investigative sites and cros in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials and allocated manufacturing costs of mrna supply and consumables costs to acquire and manufacture mrna supply for preclinical studies and clinical trials are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred and subsequently allocated to programspecific manufacturing costs after completion of the programspecific production the timing of allocating manufacturing costs to programspecific costs varies depending on the program development and production schedule we do not allocate personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation costs associated with our general platform research technical development and other shared costs on a programspecific basis these costs were therefore excluded from the summary of programspecific expenses summary by modality 

discovery program expenses are costs associated with research activities for our programs in the preclinical discovery stage and primarily consist of external costs for cros and lab services and allocated manufacturing cost of preclinical mrna supply and consumables 

platform research expenses are mainly costs to develop technical advances in mrna science delivery science and manufacturing process design these costs include personnelrelated costs computer equipment facilities preclinical mrna supply and consumables and other administrative costs to support our platform research technology development and unallocated manufacturing expenses are primarily related to nonprogramspecific manufacturing process development and manufacturing costs shared discovery and development expenses are research and development costs such as personnelrelated costs and other costs which are not otherwise included in development programs discovery programs platform research technical development and unallocated manufacturing expenses stockbased compensation and other expenses 

we have developed six modalities as of february 14 2020  we had 12  programs in clinical trials and a total of 24  development candidates across our 23  programs summarized by modality as follows 

 the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities including development of our platform mrna technologies and manufacturing technologies we expense research and development costs as incurred and cannot reasonably estimate the nature timing and estimated costs required to complete the development of the development candidates and investigational medicines we are currently developing or may develop in the future there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development of such development candidates and investigational medicines including but not limited to 

 a change in expectations or outcomes of any of the known or unknown risks and uncertainties may materially impact our expected research and development expenditures continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials we expect our costs to continue to increase in the future as our investigational medicines progress through the development phases and as we identify and develop additional programs however we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total programspecific expenses through commercialization there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our investigational medicines including future trial design and various regulatory requirements many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time due to the early stage of development of our investigational medicines additionally future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation for executives finance legal human resources business development and other administrative and operational functions professional fees accounting and legal services information technology and facilityrelated costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property or ip these costs relate to the operation of the business unrelated to the research and development function or any individual program 

we anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase if research and development expands these increases will likely relate to additional personnel and increased costs related to finance legal and iprelated matters along with increased expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company such as fees related to audit legal and tax services regulatory compliance programs and investor relations in addition if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our investigational medicines and do not enter into a thirdparty commercialization collaboration we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales and marketing team to support medicine sales marketing and distribution activities 

we have a broad ip portfolio covering our development and commercialization of mrna vaccine and therapeutic programs including those related to mrna design formulation and manufacturing platform technologies we regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development we also hold trademarks and trademark applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions costs to secure and defend our ip are expensed as incurred and are classified as general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses including iprelated expenses totaled 1096 million  943 million and 647 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively iprelated expenses including our internal personnelrelated costs were 134 million  119 million and 107 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively we did not incur litigation expenses related to our ip during the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  

interest income 

interest income consists of interest generated from our investments in cash and cash equivalents money market funds and highquality fixed income securities 

other expense income net 

other expense income net consists of gains losses from the sale of investments in marketable securities interest expense and other income and expense unrelated to our core operations 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions on an ongoing basis we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances facts and experience the effects of material revisions in estimates if any are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates 

while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we have primarily generated revenue from our strategic alliances our strategic alliances with strategic collaborators typically contain multiple elements including research and other licenses options to obtain development and commercialization rights research and development services obligations to develop and manufacture preclinical and clinical material and options to obtain additional research and development services and preclinical and clinical material such arrangements provide for various types of payments to us including upfront fees funding of research and development services and preclinical and clinical material technical development regulatory and commercial milestone payments licensing fees option exercise fees and royalty and earnout payments on product sales such payments are often not commensurate with the timing of revenue recognition and therefore result in deferral of revenue recognition 

on january 1 2019 we adopted accounting standards codification asc topic 606 revenue from contracts with customers asc 606 which supersedes all existing revenue recognition requirements in the historical accounting and most industry specific guidance asc 606 applies to all contracts with customers except for contracts that are within the scope of other standards such as leases insurance collaboration arrangements and financial instruments 

we analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of asc topic 808 collaborative arrangements asc 808 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities to the extent the arrangement is within the scope of asc 808 we assess whether aspects of the arrangement between us and our collaboration partner are within the scope of other accounting literature if we conclude that some or all aspects of the arrangement represent a transaction with a customer we account for those aspects of the arrangement within the scope of asc 606 if we conclude that some or all aspects of the arrangement are within the scope of asc 808 and do not represent a transaction with a customer we recognize our allocation of the shared costs incurred with respect to the jointly conducted activities as a component of the related expense in the period incurred pursuant to asc 606 a customer is a party that has contracted with an entity to obtain goods or services that are an output of the entity’s ordinary activities in exchange for consideration under asc 606 an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services 

to determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of asc 606 we perform the following steps i identify the contracts with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied asc 606 requires significant judgment and estimates and results in changes to but not limited to i the determination of the transaction price including estimates of variable consideration ii the allocation of the transaction price including the determination of estimated selling price and iii the pattern of recognition including the application of proportional performance as a measure of progress on servicerelated promises and application of pointintime recognition for supplyrelated promises 

the transaction price is generally comprised of an upfront payment due at contract inception and variable consideration in the form of payments for our services and materials and milestone payments due upon the achievement of specified events other payments the company could be entitled to include tiered royalties earned when customers recognize net sales of licensed products we consider the existence of any significant financing component within our arrangements and have determined that a significant financing component does not exist in our arrangements as substantive business purposes exist to support the payment structure other than to provide a significant benefit of financing we measure the transaction price based on the amount of consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods andor services to the customer we utilize either the expected value method or the most likely amount method to estimate the amount of variable consideration depending on which method is expected to better predict the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled amounts of variable consideration are included in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved with respect to arrangements that include payments for a development or regulatory milestone payment we evaluate whether the associated event is considered probable of achievement and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee such as those dependent upon receipt of regulatory approval are not considered to be probable of achievement until the triggering event occurs at the end of each reporting period we reevaluate the probability of achievement of each milestone and any related constraint and if necessary adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catchup basis which would affect revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment for arrangements that include salesbased royalties including milestone payments based upon the achievement of a certain level of product sales wherein the license is deemed to be the sole or predominant item to which the payments relate we recognize revenue upon the later of i when the related sales occur or ii when the performance obligation to which some or all of the payment has been allocated has been satisfied or partially satisfied consideration that would be received for optional goods andor services is excluded from the transaction price at contract inception 

we generally allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on a relative standalone selling price basis we develop assumptions that require judgment to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation in consideration of applicable market conditions and relevant entityspecific factors including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated research and development costs however in certain instances we allocate variable consideration entirely to one or more performance obligation if the terms of the variable consideration relate to the satisfaction of the respective performance obligation and the amount allocated is consistent with the amount we would expect to receive for the satisfaction of the respective performance obligation 

we recognize revenue based on the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to each respective performance obligation when or as the performance obligation is satisfied by transferring a promised good or service to the customer for performance obligations that are satisfied at a point in time we recognize revenue when control of the goods andor services is transferred to the customer for 

performance obligations that are satisfied over time we recognize revenue by measuring the progress toward complete satisfaction of the performance obligation using a single method of measuring progress which depicts the performance in transferring control of the associated goods andor services to the customer we generally use input methods to measure the progress toward the complete satisfaction of performance obligations satisfied over time with respect to arrangements containing a license to our intellectual property that is determined to be distinct from the other performance obligations identified in the arrangement we recognize revenue from amounts allocated to the license when the license is transferred to the licensee and the licensee is able to use and benefit from the license for licenses that are bundled with other promises we utilize judgment to assess the nature of the combined performance obligation to determine whether the combined performance obligation is satisfied over time or at a point in time and if over time the appropriate method of measuring progress for purposes of recognizing revenue significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement we evaluate the measure of progress each reporting period and if necessary adjust the measure of performance and related revenue recognition any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catchup basis which would affect revenue and net loss in the period of adjustment 

research and development costs 

as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses a significant portion of which are clinical study expenses conducted by thirdparty service providers this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to 

 we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones in accruing service fees we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly 

we make estimates of our research and development accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time we recognize costs for certain development activities based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites such as number of sites activated number of patient enrollments and visits and patient duration we determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials we periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary upon settlement these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual costs however due to the nature of estimates we cannot provide assurance that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our research activities and clinical trials 

stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units we measure and recognize compensation expense for our stockbased awards granted to our employees and nonemployee directors based on the estimated grant date fair value in accordance with asc 718  compensation—stock compensation  

our stockbased awards are subject to either service or performancebased vesting conditions we recognize compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployee directors with servicebased vesting on a straightline basis based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployee directors with performancebased vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using an accelerated attribution method to the extent the achievement of the performance condition is probable we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur 

we classify stockbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified in future periods we expect stockbased compensation expense to increase due in part to our existing unrecognized stockbased compensation expense and as we grant additional stockbased awards to continue to attract and retain our employees 

we determine the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the fair value of our common stock we estimate the fair value of our stock options using the blackscholes option pricing model which requires inputs of subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of our stock ii the expected term of the award iii the riskfree interest rate iv expected dividends and v the fair value of common stock due to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data we based our estimate of expected volatility on the estimate and expected volatilities of a guideline group of publicly traded companies for these analyses we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value risk profiles and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stockbased awards we compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated expected term of our stockbased awards we will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available we estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees and nonemployee directors using the simplified method whereby the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option we utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for stock options granted to nonemployees we utilize the contractual term of the option as the basis for the expected term assumption for the determination of the riskfree interest rates we utilize the us treasury yield curve for instruments in effect at the time of measurement with a term commensurate with the expected term assumption the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes based on an asset and liability approach we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income the amount and timing of which are uncertain valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31 2019  we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence 

we may become subject to income tax audits and adjustments by local tax authorities the nature of uncertain tax positions is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change which may be substantial we develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions and the associated cumulative probabilities using internal expertise and assistance from thirdparty experts as additional information becomes available estimates are revised and refined differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax expense 

we record reserves for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions these reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense to date no amount has been recorded for uncertain tax positions 

recently issued accounting pronouncements 

we have reviewed all recently issued standards and have determined that other than as disclosed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements such standards will not have a material impact on our financial statements or do not otherwise apply to our operations 

results of operations 

the following tables summarize our consolidated statements of operations for each period presented in thousands 





revenue 

total revenue decrease d by 749 million  or 55  in 2019  primarily due to a decrease in collaboration revenue collaboration revenue decrease d by 745 million  or 61  in 2019  mainly due to decreased revenue across all our strategic alliances particularly astrazeneca and merck largely driven by our adoption of asc 606 and the completion of the initial fouryear research period under the 2016 merck agreement see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our adoption of asc 606 grant revenue remained relatively flat in 2019  there was a decrease in revenue from darpa as the research and development activities under the darpa awards were substantially concluded at the end of 2018 offset by increases in revenue from gates foundation and barda 

total revenue decrease d by 708 million  or 34  in 2018  primarily due to decreases in both collaboration revenue and grant revenue collaboration revenue decrease d by 545 million  or 31  in 2018  mainly driven by higher revenue in 2017 due to accelerated recognition of 703 million of revenue upon the termination of the alexion strategic alliance arrangement in october 2018 grant 

revenue decrease d by 163 million  or 56  in 2018  largely attributable to a decrease in revenue of 134 million from the barda contract primarily due to revisions to the zika program and a focus on preclinical studies of mrna1893 a follow on to mrna1325 

operating expenses 

research and development expenses 

research and development expenses increase d by 422 million  or 9  in 2019  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs of 374 million  an increase in clinical trial and manufacturing costs of 169 million  an increase in stockbased compensation of 106 million  and an increase  in depreciation and amortization of 52 million  the increases were partially offset by a decrease in inlicensing costs of 220 million related to inlicensing agreements executed in 2017 with cellscript llc and its affiliate mrna ribotherapeutics inc cellscript to sublicense certain patent rights and a decrease in lab supplies and materials of 82 million  the increases in personnel related costs and stockbased compensation were largely driven by an increase in the number of employees supporting our research and development programs the inlicensing costs decreased in 2019 as the sublicense grant fees were fully recognized at the end of 2018 

research and development expenses increased by 436 million or 11 in 2018  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in personnel related costs of 266 million an increase in stockbased compensation of 160 million an increase in consulting and outside services of 131 million an increase in facility and equipment related costs of 124 million and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of 43 million the increases in personnel related costs and stockbased compensation were largely driven by an increase in the number of employees supporting our research and development programs these increases were partially offset by a decrease of 310 million in costs related to inlicensing agreements executed in 2017 with cellscript 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses increased by 154 million  or 16  in 2019  the increase was primarily due to an increase in insurance costs of 52 million an increase  in consulting and outside services of 49 million  an increase  in information technology and facilityrelated costs of 40 million  and an increase  in personnel related costs of 25 million  the increases in insurance costs consulting and outside services and personnel related costs were primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees and costs in support of being a publicly traded company 

general and administrative expenses increased by 295 million or 46 in 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase in stockbased compensation of 165 million an increase in personnel related costs of 72 million and an increase in consulting and outside services of 35 million the increase in stockbased compensation was mainly attributable to certain performancebased equity awards with vesting or commencement contingent on our initial public offering ipo and an increase in the number of employees the increase in personnel related costs were primarily driven by an increase in the number of employees these increases and the increase in consulting and outside services were in support of our public company readiness 

interest income 

interest income generated from our investments in marketable securities increased by 115 million  or 43  in 2019  mainly driven by a higher weighted average balance of cash and investments primarily from the net proceeds of our ipo interest income from our investments in marketable securities increased by 118 million or 77 in 2018 mainly driven by an overall higher market interest rate and a higher weighted average balance of cash and investments in 2018 primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock 

other expense income net 

the following tables summarizes other expense income net for each period presented in thousands 





total other expense net increased by 94 million  in 2019  the increase was mainly attributable to a onetime 70 million cash receipt in 2018 as consideration for the waiver of a third partys previously negotiated commitment and higher interest expense in 2019 of 35 million  related to our financing lease liabilities we started recording the interest expense in july 2018 upon the completion of our moderna technology center manufacturing facility or mtc south please refer to note 7 to our consolidated financial statements 

total other income net increased by 37 million in 2018 the increase was primarily due to an increase of 56 million in other income net mainly attributable to a 70 million cash receipt as consideration for the waiver of a third partys previously negotiated commitment this increase was partially offset by higher interest expense of 30 million related to our mtc south lease financing obligation we began recording interest expense upon the completion of our mtc south in july 2018 

benefit from provision for income taxes 

there were no significant income tax benefits or provisions in 2019 2018 and 2017 

liquidity and capital resources 

we have historically funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity instruments and from proceeds from certain strategic alliance arrangements and grant agreements as of december 31 2019  we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 126 billion  cash and cash equivalents and investments are invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation investments consisting primarily of government and corporate debt securities are stated at fair value as of december 31 2019  we had current and noncurrent investments of approximately 8671 million  and 1600 million  respectively 

we began construction of our mtc south manufacturing facility in the second half of 2016 our capital expenditures related to mtc south were 39 million 865 million and 599 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively cash disbursements related to mtc south were 146 million 945 million and 412 million for the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017  respectively mtc south officially opened in july 2018 the remaining manufacturing equipment and processes which were still in progress at the time when mtc south opened were completed during 2019 

in the second quarter of 2019 we entered into an additional lease for office and laboratory space nearby or mtc north also located in norwood we have designed and started construction of mtc north in the fourth quarter of 2019 our capital expenditures and cash disbursements related to mtc north were 19 million and 05 million for the year ended december 31 2019  respectively 

on january 30 2018 and february 15 2018 we issued series g preferred stock for total gross proceeds of 5600 million on may 7 2018 we issued series h preferred stock for gross proceeds of 1250 million of which 130 million was determined to be a premium and recorded to deferred revenue as part of the merck pcvsav agreement executed contemporaneously with our series h redeemable convertible preferred stock issuance please refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements 

on december 11 2018 we closed our ipo whereby we sold 26275993 shares of common stock at a price of 2300 per share the shares began trading on the nasdaq global select market on december 7 2018 the aggregate net proceeds received by us from the ipo were 5630 million  net of underwriting discounts commissions and offering expenses 

on february 14 2020 we sold 26315790 shares of common stock at a price of 1900 per share through a public equity offering the aggregate net proceeds from the offering were approximately 4781 million net of underwriting discounts commissions and estimated offering expenses in addition the underwriters have exercised their option to purchase an additional 3947368 shares of common stock at the public offering price less the underwriting discount resulting in additional net proceeds of 718 million 

cash flow 

the following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for each period presented in thousands 



operating activities 

we derive cash flows from operations primarily from cash collected from certain strategic alliances our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we have invested in our mrna technologies development pipeline digital infrastructure manufacturing technology and infrastructure 

net cash used in operating activities in 2019  was 4590 million  and consisted of net loss of 5140 million  less noncash adjustments of 1087 million  plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 537 million  noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 811 million  depreciation and amortization of 310 million  and amortization of investment premiums and discounts of 37 million  the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease  in deferred revenue of 441 million  a decrease  in accounts payable of 240 million  a decrease in other liabilities of 62 million  an increase in rightofuse assets operating leases of 57 million  and an decrease  in accrued liabilities of 34 million  partially offset by an increase in operating lease liabilities noncurrent of 126 million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of 98 million  and a decrease in accounts receivable of 67 million  

net cash used in operating activities in 2018 was 3309 million and consisted of net loss of 3847 million less noncash adjustments of 965 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 426 million noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 726 million and depreciation and amortization of 249 million the net change in assets and liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of 653 million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of 53 million partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of 150 million and an increase in accrued liabilities of 88 million 

net cash used in operating activities in 2017  was 3315 million and consisted of net loss of 2559 million less noncash adjustments of 617 million plus a net change in assets and liabilities of 1372 million noncash items primarily included stockbased compensation of 401 million and depreciation and amortization of 205 million the net change in assets and liabilities in 2017 was primarily due to a decrease in deferred revenue of 1623 million mainly driven by revenue recognition of 703 million resulting from termination of alexion strategic alliance arrangements a decrease in accounts payable of 128 million partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities of 344 million including a 250 million inlicense payment accrual 

investing activities 

our primary investing activities consist of purchases sales and maturities of our investments and capital expenditures for manufacturing laboratory computer equipment and software 

net cash used in investing activities in 2019  was 149 million  which included purchases of marketable securities of 115 billion  and purchases of property and equipment of 316 million  partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 9932 million  and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 1687 million  

net cash used in investing activities in 2018 was 3731 million which included purchases of marketable securities of 123 billion and purchases of property and equipment of 1058 million partially offset by proceeds from maturities of marketable securities of 7834 million and proceeds from sales of marketable securities of 1770 million

financing activities 

we generated cash from financing activities of 511 million  in 2019  primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity plans of 473 million  and net proceeds from the purchase of common stock from our employee stock purchase plan of 29 million  

we generated cash from financing activities of 123 billion in 2018 primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock of 6611 million and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of 5630 million in connection with our ipo 

we had insignificant financing activities in 2017 

operation and funding requirements 

since our inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations due to our significant research and development expenses we have an accumulated deficit of 150 billion  and 101 billion  as of december 31 2019  and 2018  respectively we expect to continue to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future and expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities particularly as we continue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines in addition we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company our expenses will also increase if and as we 

 we are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forwardlooking statement and involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect we believe that our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2019  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months 

our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to 



 until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our programs we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings structured financings or debt financings and potential future strategic alliances from which we receive upfront fees milestone payments and other forms of consideration additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our investigational medicines or slow down or cease work on one or more of our programs if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders or increased fixed payment obligations and any such securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock if we incur indebtedness we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise funds through strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams research programs or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us any of these events could significantly harm our business financial condition and prospects 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2019  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2019  and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



 



 under our strategic collaboration agreements we are committed to perform certain research development and manufacturing activities as part of our personalized mrna cancer vaccines or pcv collaboration and license agreement with merck we are committed to perform certain research development and manufacturing activities related to pcv products through an initial phase 2 clinical trial up to a budgeted amount of 2430 million as of december 31 2019 please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the expenses we expect to incur as part of our commitments under the pcv and other collaboration agreements were not included in the above table as we are not able to determine the timing and amounts of such expenses 

we have agreements with certain vendors for various services including services related to clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs under such agreements we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors mainly to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation the exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated at december 31 2019  we had cancelable open purchase orders of 1059 million  in total under such agreements for our clinical operations and support and contract manufacturing these amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay at december 31 2019  assuming we would not cancel these agreements the actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the cancelable open purchase order amounts of 1059 million  

in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2019  and 2018  we had cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments in marketable securities of 126 billion  and 169 billion  respectively our investment portfolio comprises money market funds and marketable debt securities including us treasury securities debt securities of us government agencies and corporate entities and commercial paper our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity and our investment policy defines allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to have very low risk exposure our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates our available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 

we generally hold investments in marketable debt securities to maturity to limit our exposure to interest rate risk due to the shortterm maturities and low risk profiles of our investments we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points or one percentage point from levels at december 31 2019  and 2018  the net fair value of our interest sensitive marketable securities would not experience a material change in fair market value 

we currently do not have significant exposure to foreign currencies as we hold no foreign exchange contracts option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements further our operations and revenue generating activities are primarily denominated in us dollars our operations may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future 

inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations during the years ended december 31 2019  2018  and 2017

changes in internal controls over financial reporting 

during the three months ended december 31 2019 we implemented certain internal controls in connection with our adoption of asc 842 there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting as defined in rules 13a15f and 15d15f under the exchange act during the three months ended december 31 2019 that have materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting 

inherent limitations on the effectiveness of controls 

control systems no matter how well conceived and operated are designed to provide a reasonable but not an absolute level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any have been detected because of the inherent limitations in any control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected

the mrna opportunity 

mrna the software of life 

messenger rna or mrna transfers the information stored in our genes to the cellular machinery that makes all the proteins required for life our genes are stored as sequences of dna which contain the instructions to make specific proteins dna serves as a hard drive safely storing these instructions in the nucleus until they are needed by the cell 

when a cell needs to produce a protein the instructions to make that protein are copied from the dna to mrna which serves as the template for protein production each mrna molecule contains the instructions to produce a specific protein with a distinct function in the body mrna transmits those instructions to cellular machinery called ribosomes that make copies of the required protein 

we see mrna functioning as the “software of life” every cell uses mrna to provide real time instructions to make the proteins necessary to drive all aspects of biology including in human health and disease this was codified as the central dogma of molecular biology over 50 years ago and is exemplified in the schematic below 

mrna is used to make every type of protein including secreted membrane and intracellular proteins in varying quantities over time in different locations and in various combinations this is shown in the figure below 

given its essential role we believe mrna could be used to create a new class of medicines with significant potential to improve the lives of patients over the last 40 years the biotechnology industry has created a new category of drugs based on recombinant protein technology these drugs rely on secreted proteins including antibodies and protein replacements to treat a wide range of diseases this category of drugs accounts for over 200 billion in annual worldwide sales however intracellular and membrane proteins represent as much as twothirds of the proteins in humans and are largely beyond the reach of recombinant protein technology based on the ability of mrna to produce these proteins directly in cells we believe that mrnabased medicines have the potential to help patients in ways that could equal or exceed the impact of recombinant proteinbased drugs 

the structure of mrna 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprising four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the molecule that codes for a protein or the coding region the sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons the first codon or start codon aug signals where the ribosome should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein to end protein synthesis three different codons uaa uag and uga serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate protein synthesis in total there are 64 potential codons but only 20 amino acids that are used to build proteins therefore multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid 

the process of protein production is called translation because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids as shown in the figure below the coding region is analogous to a sentence in english much like a start codon a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

the intrinsic advantages of using mrna as a medicine 

we believe mrna possesses inherent characteristics that could serve as the foundation for a new class of medicines these characteristics include 

 as a result mrna could have many of the attractive pharmacologic features of most modern medicines including reproducible activity predictable potency and wellbehaved dose dependency and the ability to adjust dosing based on an individual patient’s needs including stopping or lowering the dose to seek to ensure safety and tolerability 

mrna as a new class of medicines 

based on these and other features we have developed four core beliefs about the value drivers of mrna as a new class of medicines 



 recombinant proteinbased drugs significantly advanced patient care and transformed the biopharmaceutical industry we believe that the development of mrna as a new class of medicines could represent another breakthrough for patients and our industry 

our strategic principles and approach to managing risk 

our strategy is designed to deliver on the full scope of the mrna opportunity over the longterm reaching patients with mrna medicines requires us to make complex choices including how much capital we devote to technology creation drug discovery drug development and infrastructure which programs we advance and how whether we advance programs alone or with strategic collaborators and which capabilities we build internally versus outsource 

to navigate these choices we established five strategic principles that guide our approach to creating longterm value for patients and investors no single strategic principle dominates our choices embedded in every decision we make is also our assessment of the most important risks inherent in our business we believe these risks fall into four categories technology biology execution and financing 

to increase our chances of success we often find it necessary to balance our neartomidterm risks against the strategic principles that guide our approach to longterm value creation 

our strategic principles 

 our approach to managing risk 

in conjunction with the strategic principles that guide our approach to longterm value creation we actively manage the risks inherent in our business at present these categories of risk include technology biology execution and financing we summarize our approach to managing these risks below 



velocity decisionmaking we make forward investments in infrastructure including manufacturing lastly we have created a digital backbone to track all aspects of our programs and anticipate challenges before they arise 

 there is no single strategic principle nor single category of risk that dominates our decisionmaking and universal rules do not exist across our portfolio our tradeoffs generally involve balancing nearterm risks and longterm value creation because development cycles are long our choices are complex we expect the weighting and types of risk we face will evolve as our business matures we believe that disciplined capital allocation across near and longterm choices must be a core competency if we are to maximize the opportunity for patient impact and shareholder value creation 

our progress 

we are encouraged by our results to date across the six modalities that we have established we have 20  programs in development and manufactured dozens of drug substance lots for use in indenabling good laboratory practice or glp toxicology studies “indenabling” refers to studies required for investigational new drug application or ind or equivalent nonus regulatory filings such as a clinical trial application or cta we and our strategic collaborators have completed indenabling glp toxicology programs to support our 15 open inds andor ctas for our development candidates manufactured dozens of current good manufacturing practice or cgmp batches of clinical trial materials and have 11 programs in clinical trials and another 3 with open inds over 1000 subjects have been enrolled in our clinical trials to fund these activities we have raised over 32 billion  as of december 31 2018  including 24 billion  from equity issuances and 08 billion  in upfront payments milestone payments and option exercise fees from strategic collaborators 

our platform 

overview of our platform 

our “platform” refers to our accumulated knowledge and capabilities in basic and applied sciences across mrna the delivery of mrna to target tissues and the manufacturing processes for making potential mrna medicines we invest in basic science to discover foundational mechanistic insights and we invest in applied sciences to invent technology that harnesses those insights we use our platform to identify and develop new mrna medicines when we identify a combination of platform technologies or programs across mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes that can enable shared product features across multiple potential mrna medicines we group those programs as a modality the primary goal of our platform is to identify new modalities and to expand the utility of our existing modalities we are committed to advancing the technological frontier of mrna medicines over the long term 

we define success in our platform as achieving the following pharmacologic properties 

 achieving any of these pharmacologic properties requires many often interdependent technological solutions we organize our efforts into three core scientific areas mrna delivery and manufacturing process as shown in the figure below 

we pursue mrna science both to minimize undesirable activation of the immune system by mrna and to maximize the mrna potency of mrna once inside target cells we pursue delivery science to protect mrna from extracellular enzymes that would degrade it to avoid counterproductive interactions of our delivery vehicles with the immune system deliver mrna to desired tissues and facilitate mrna transport across cell membranes to the translational machinery within cells finally we have learned that the methods for producing mrna and lipid nanoparticle or lnp delivery systems can have profound positive and negative effects on pharmacology we pursue process science to optimize these features for our future medicines and to develop technical capabilities to scale our potential mrna medicines for clinical development 

we have incurred over 500 million of expense to advance our platform technology and our intellectual property this investment has underpinned the creation of all six of our existing modalities and helped us to establish fundamental intellectual property we intend to sustain our investment in our platform in the future because we believe we can establish new modalities and continue to make meaningful improvements in the performance of our current modalities 

the success of our current platform and the current pipeline of 20  programs that it underpins depends on hundreds of small advances in our three core scientific areas examples of many critical advances that we have made are described below these advances demonstrate our significant progress to date and exemplify our approach to tackling hundreds of smaller scientific problems and organizing them into technological solutions 

our platform mrna science 

an overview of mrna biology 

messenger rna is a linear polymer comprised of four monomers called nucleotides adenosine a guanosine g cytosine c and uridine u within the region of the mrna molecule that serves as instructions for protein synthesis the coding region the exact sequence of these four nucleotides forms a language made up of threeletter words called codons one codon the start codon aug serves to signal where the ribosome should start protein synthesis to know what protein to make the ribosome then progresses along the mrna one codon at a time appending the appropriate amino acid to the growing protein chain because the ribosome is reading in one language a sequence of codons and outputting in another language a sequence of amino acids this process is called translation finally three different codons uaa uag and uga can serve as stop signals telling the ribosome where to terminate 

protein synthesis the production of proteins from mrna sequences is called translation and is used to make all human proteins the production of mrna from dna is called transcription 

as shown in the figure below the coding region in an mrna molecule is analogous to a sentence in english the start codon indicates the start of the protein much like a capitalized word can indicate the start of a sentence codons within the coding region resemble groups of letters representing words the end of the sentence is signaled by a period in english or a stop codon for mrna 

in every cell hundreds of thousands of mrnas make hundreds of millions of proteins every day a typical protein contains 200600 amino acids therefore a typical mrna coding region ranges from 6001800 nucleotides 

in addition to the coding region mrnas contain four other key features 1 the 5’ untranslated region or 5’utr 2 the 3’ untranslated region or 3’utr 3 the 5’ cap and 4 a 3’ polyadenosine or polya tail the sequence of nucleotides in the 5’utr influences how efficiently the ribosome initiates protein synthesis whereas the sequence of nucleotides in the 3’utr contains information about which cell types should translate that mrna and how long the mrna should last the 5’ cap and 3’ polya tail enhance ribosome engagement and protect the mrna from attack by intracellular enzymes that digest mrna from its ends 

as a result of this biology mrna has several key features first mrna is exquisitely specific there is a onetoone correspondence between an mrna molecule and the protein dictated by the coding sequence second the biological effects of mrna are amplified because each mrna copy can be translated thousands of times we believe that in some cases a small number of mrna copies per cell may be sufficient to induce a pharmacologic effect finally mrna is impermanent mrnas produce proteins for a defined and biologicallyregulated period of time without risk of changing genes or cell dna if dosing of mrna stops protein production will stop and the biological effects generally can be reversed 

decades of academic investigation have uncovered the basic mechanisms of mrna translation parallel efforts have uncovered how the innate immune system determines selfmrna versus foreign rna from rnabased viruses we are grateful for the deep scientific foundation established by these pioneers yet as we seek to develop mrna into medicines we often find ourselves at the frontiers of current understanding therefore we invest in both applied and basic research seeking to advance both the state of our technology and the state of the scientific community’s understanding of mrna examples of advances in mrna science that combine nucleotide chemistry sequence engineering and targeting elements are described below 

mrna chemistry modified nucleotides to mitigate immune system activation 

the innate immune system has evolved to protect cells from foreign rna such as viral rna by inducing inflammation and suppressing mrna translation once detected many cells surveil their environment through sensors called tolllikereceptors or tlrs these include types that are activated by the presence of doublestranded rna tlr3 or uridine containing rna fragments tlr7 tlr8 additionally all cells have cytosolic doublestranded rna or dsrna sensors including retinoic acid inducible genei or rigi that are sensitive to foreign rna inside the cell 

the immune and cellular response to mrna is complex context specific and often linked to the sensing of uridine to minimize undesired immune responses to our potential mrna medicines our platform employs chemicallymodified uridine nucleotides to minimize recognition by both immune cell sensors such as tlr378 and broadlydistributed cytosolic receptors such as rigi mrna produced using our synthesis technologies and containing unmodified uridine results in significant upregulation of secreted 

cytokines such as ip10 as shown in the figure below administration of monocytederived macrophages or mdms with unmodified mrna formulated in lnps results in an increased ratio of ip10 transcripts relative to a housekeeping gene hprt by substituting unmodified uridine with a modified uridine we can substantially reduce immune cell activation in this assay the control contains only transfection agent and no mrna in multiple preclinical experiments we have demonstrated reduced immune cell activation including of b cells lower immunoglobulin secretion and lower cytokine expression when administering mrna made with modified uridine versus unmodified uridine to date when deploying these technologies we have yet to observe doselimiting toxicity attributable to the mrna encoding proteins from our drug substance even at the exaggerated doses in indenabling glp toxicology programs importantly in preclinical testing our chemicallymodified uridine has not significantly affected the ribosome’s ability to read and translate the mrna sequence 

nucleotide chemistry of mrna reduces immune activation  in vitro  in mdms 

mrna sequence engineering maximizing protein expression 

mrna exists transiently in the cytoplasm during which time it can be translated into thousands of proteins before eventually being degraded our platform applies bioinformatic biochemical and biological screening capabilities most of which have been invented internally that aim to optimize the amount of protein produced per mrna we have identified proprietary sequences for the 5’utr that have been observed to increase the likelihood that a ribosome bound to the 5’end of the mrna transcript will find the desired start codon and reliably initiate translation of the coding region 

we additionally design the nucleotide sequence of the coding region to maximize its successful translation into protein as previously described there are often multiple codons that encode for a specific amino acid the amount of protein produced by an mrna sequence is known to be partly determined by the codons it uses with certain codons being more or less common in endogenous mrnas we have found that the amount of protein produced is also determined by the secondary structure of mrna or the propensity of mrna to fold on itself with more structured mrnas producing more protein we designed a set of sequences which independently varied codon usage and structure of the mrna as shown in the figure below protein expression in the alpha mouse liver 12 or aml12 cell line is highest for sequences containing more commonly occurring codons and also more structured mrna both codon usage and structure have an independent and additive effect on protein expression shown as mean expression solid line as measured by fluorescence of the expressed protein with 95 confidence interval in gray the total expression area under the curve or auc and standard error of the mean for auc are shown for each quadrant in relative fluorescence units per hour or rfuh by optimizing translation initiation and efficiency we have further increased the average number of fulllength desired proteins expressed per molecule mrna this permits us to reduce the mrna doses required to achieve the same therapeutic benefit 

sequences with more structure and more common codons in mrna maximize protein expression  in vitro 

targeting elements enabling tissuetargeted translation 

all nucleated cells in the body are capable of translating mrna resulting in pharmacologic activity in any cell in which mrna is delivered and translated to minimize or prevent potential offtarget effects our platform employs technologies that regulate mrna translation in select cell types cells often contain short rna sequences called micrornas or mirnas that bind to mrna to regulate protein translation at the mrna level different cell types have different concentrations of specific micrornas in effect giving cells a microrna signature microrna binding directly to mrna effectively silences or reduces mrna translation and promotes mrna degradation we design microrna binding sites into the 3’utr of our potential mrna medicines so that if our mrna is delivered to cells with such micrornas it will be minimally translated and rapidly degraded 

as an example we have demonstrated by intratumoral administration in an animal model that an mrna encoding a cytotoxic protein and containing a microrna binding site can be used to selectively kill cancer cells while protecting systemic tissues such as liver cells in a mouse model of cancer hep3b subcutaneous xenograft mouse liver enzyme levels and immunohistochemistry or ihc of cleaved caspase3 or cc3 indicate production of an apoptosisinducing protein encoded by mrna in tumor cells but not healthy liver cells when the mrna has multiple mir122 target sites this is denoted as 3x122ts in the figure below mir122 is more prevalent in noncancerous liver cells but absent in the cancerous liver cells we published this work in  nucleic acid therapeutics  in 2018 

tissuetargeted translation of mrna encoding a proapoptotic protein 

and microrna binding sites in mouse study 

our platform delivery science 

we focus on the delivery of our mrna molecules to specific tissues our mrna can in specific instances such as our vegf therapeutic be delivered by direct injection to a tissue in a simple saline formulation without lipid nanoparticles or lnps to locally produce small amounts of pharmacologically active protein however the blood and interstitial fluids in humans contain significant rna degrading enzymes that rapidly degrade any extracellular mrna and prevent broader distribution without lnps additionally cell membranes tend to act as a significant barrier to entry of large negativelycharged molecules such as mrna we have therefore 

invested heavily in delivery science and have developed lnp technologies as well as alternative nanoparticle approaches to enable delivery of larger quantities of mrna to target tissues 

lnps are generally composed of four components an amino lipid a phospholipid cholesterol and a pegylatedlipid or peglipid each component as well as the overall composition or mix of components contributes to the properties of each lnp system lnps containing mrna injected into the body rapidly bind proteins that can drive uptake of lnps into cells once internalized in endosomes within cells the lnps are designed to escape the endosome and release their mrna cargo into the cell cytoplasm where the mrna can be translated to make a protein and have the desired therapeutic effect any mrna and lnp components that do not escape the endosome are typically delivered to lysosomes where they are degraded by the natural process of cellular digestion 

examples of tools we developed by using our platform include proprietary lnp formulations that address the steps of mrna delivery including cell uptake endosomal escape and subsequent lipid metabolism and for avoidance of counterproductive interactions with the immune system examples of delivery tools we have developed are described below 

chemistry novel lipid chemistry to potentially improve safety and tolerability 

we initially used lnp formulations that were based on known lipid systems which we refer to as “legacy lnps” a recognized limitation of these legacy lnps is the potential for inflammatory reactions upon single and repeat administration that can impact tolerability and therapeutic index our laterdeveloped proprietary lnp systems are therefore designed to be highly tolerated and minimize any lnp vehiclerelated toxicities with repeat administration  in vivo  the changes we made have included engineering amino lipids to avoid the immune system and to be rapidly biodegradable relative to prior lipids as shown in the figure below administered intravenously in nonhuman primates at 02 mgkg our proprietary lnps demonstrate rapid clearance of the lipid from panel a plasma and b various organs 12 hours post administration

even in the case of vaccines where one might hypothesize that lnpinduced immune stimulation could potentially increase the effectiveness of the vaccine we have demonstrated in preclinical studies that we can maintain the desired immune response to the vaccine while reducing undesired local immune reaction or reactogenicity to the lnp as shown in the figure below representative histology sections in the muscle stained with hematoxalin and eosin two days after a single intramuscular administration in rats demonstrated less inflammation and muscle cell necrosis with our proprietary lnps vs legacy lnps containing 01 mg of our mrna as exemplified in the box with the legacy lnp in panel a necrosis and degeneration of muscle cells and inflammation were observed dotted box with our proprietary lnps inflammation dotted box and muscle cell necrosis were less extensive serum cytokine levels shown in panel b are lower with our proprietary lnps vs legacy lnps

our platform includes extensive inhouse expertise in medicinal chemistry which we have applied to design large libraries of novel lipids using these libraries in combination with our discovery biology capabilities we have conducted high throughput screens for desired lnp properties and believe that we have made fundamental discoveries in preclinical studies about the relationships between structural motifs of lipids and lnp performance for protein expression by screening for components and compositions that enhance the amount of mrna delivered per cell and protein expression we have demonstrated with intravenous administration up to a sixfold improvement in protein production over the prior state of the art for lnps as shown in the figure below n3 rats 95 ci shown

we have designed our proprietary lnp systems for sustained pharmacology upon repeat dosing by eliminating or altering features that activate the immune system these are based on insights into the surface properties of lnps upon repeated dosing surface features on traditional lnps such as amino lipids phospholipids and peglipids can be recognized by the immune system leading to rapid clearance from the bloodstream a decrease in potency upon repeat dosing and an increase in inflammation 

based on our insights into these mechanisms we have engineered our lnp systems to reduce or eliminate undesirable surface features in preclinical studies in nonhuman primates for our systemic therapeutic development candidates that use our novel lnp systems we have been able to repeat dose with negligible or undetectable loss in potency liver damage and immune system activation 

our platform manufacturing process science 

we invest significantly in manufacturing process science to impart more potent features to our mrna and lnps and to invent the technological capabilities necessary to manufacture our potential mrna medicines at scales ranging from micrograms to kilograms as well as achieve pharmaceutical properties such as solubility and shelf life we view developing these goals of manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties as stage appropriate for each program in some cases this includes inventing novel analytical technologies that make it possible to connect analytical characterization of mrna and lnps to biological performance 

mrna manufacturing process improving pharmacology 

our platform creates mrna using a cellfree approach called  in vitro  transcription in which an rna polymerase enzyme binds to and transcribes a dna template adding the nucleotides encoded by the dna to the growing rna strand following transcription we employ proprietary purification techniques to ensure that our mrna is free from undesired synthesis components and impurities that could activate the immune system in an indiscriminate manner applying our understanding of the basic science underlying each step in the manufacturing process we have designed proprietary manufacturing processes to impart desirable pharmacologic features for example increasing potency in a vaccine using a model antigen injected intramuscularly in mice at a 3 µg mrna dose the figure below shows the significant improvement in cd8 t cell response we have achieved through mrna manufacturing process science and engineering as evidenced by process b 

manufacturing process changes to tune immune response in mouse study 

lnp manufacturing process improving pharmacology 

our platform technology includes synthetic processes to produce lnps traditionally lnps are assembled by dissolving the four molecular components amino lipid phospholipid cholesterol and peglipid in ethanol and then mixing this with mrna in an aqueous buffer the resulting mixture is then purified to isolate lnps from impurities such impurities include molecular components that have not been incorporated into particles unencapsulated mrna that could activate the immune system and particles outside of the desired size range 

going beyond optimization of traditional manufacturing processes we have invested in understanding and measuring the various biochemical and physical interactions during lnp assembly and purification we have additionally developed stateoftheart analytical techniques necessary to characterize our lnps and biological systems to analyze their  in vitro  and  in vivo  performance with these insights we have identified manufacturing process parameters that drive lnp performance for example the potency in a secreted therapeutic setting these insights have allowed us to make significant improvements in the potency of our lnps as exemplified in the figure below for example expression of a secreted protein in our relaxin program azd7970 demonstrates an approximate eightfold increase in area under the curve or auc and approximate sixfold increase in maximum concentration for manufacturing process y versus manufacturing process x in rats dosed intravenously with 05 mgkg mrna 

manufacturing process changes to enhance relaxin protein production by mrna in rat study 

our platform progress to date 

over the last eight years we have solved numerous interdependent problems related to the pharmacologic features of our potential mrna medicines these features are detailed and exemplified below please also see the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” for recent clinical results for our investigational medicines hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 and pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 utilizing moderna proprietary technology 

  dosedependent protein expression at clinically relevant levels 

we have demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to generate consistent dosedependent levels of protein which is particularly important for therapeutics a recent example is from our indenabling nonhuman primate study for our antibody against chikungunya virus program mrna1944 we demonstrated linear dosedependence meaning three and tenfold increases in the dose of mrna led to three and tenfold increases in antibody as shown in the figure below at the top dose antibody levels reached 162 ± 46 µgml sd following first dose 0 hours and effectively doubled to 288 ± 100 µgml upon second dose 168 hours 

this dose regimen also maintained antibody trough levels above 2 µgml for 100 days in nonhuman primates a level consistent with clinically efficacious levels of many approved antibodies all doses 03 1 and 3 mgkg tested in nonhuman primates showed no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna1944 and all other observations were generally reversible 

expression of antibody against chikungunya virus with repeat dosing of mrna1944 in nonhuman primate study 

reproducible pharmacology including upon repeated dosing 

by combining advances in mrna delivery and manufacturing process science we have demonstrated in preclinical studies sustained and reproducible pharmacology the figure below shows a recent example in a mouse model that recapitulates metabolic defects in propionic acidemia or pa in this rare disease a defect in one or both of two different subunits pcca and pccb of the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase results in accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 2methylcitrate or 2mc in mice hypomorphic for the pcca subunit monthly intravenous or iv administration of mrnas encoding pcca and pccb formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna3927 resulted in a significant and sustained lowering of 2mc throughout the duration of the 6month study compared to control luciferase mrna 1 mgkg n6group

decreased immune activation upon repeat dosing in nonhuman primates 

we have observed decreased immune activation with repeat dosing in nonhuman primates as shown in the figure below panel a indicates serum concentration of human erythropoietin or hepo with repeat dosing of mrna encoding hepo in our proprietary lnps with weekly iv administration at 02 mgkg in nonhuman primates panels b and c demonstrate comparable serum concentrations of mcp1 promoting immune cell recruitment to sites of inflammation and c5b9 indicative of innate immune activation via the complement system with our proprietary lnp at 02 mgkg weekly iv infusion in nonhuman primates vs legacy lnp

in addition to this example we have completed multiple indenabling toxicology studies under glp for our two systemic therapeutics modalities for many such programs the no adverse event level was the top dose tested generally 2 mgkg or higher we believe that by combining proprietary mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing process technologies we have significantly advanced the potential therapeutic index of our potential mrnabased therapeutics 

pharmacologic activity in the target tissue and cell 

while some of our modalities such as systemic secreted therapeutics can leverage many different cell types to make therapeutic proteins others such as systemic intracellular therapeutics may require delivery of our mrna into specific tissues for instance hepatocytes in certain liver metabolic diseases combining our proprietary mrna delivery and manufacturing process technologies we have observed ontarget pharmacologic activity in hepatocytes in nonhuman primates the ontarget potency of this approach 

contrasts with traditional delivery technologies in the figure below our proprietary lnp and process result in mrna delivery to and protein expression in liver hepatocytes in nonhuman primates as demonstrated with a reporter mrna detected by  in situ  hybridization and a reporter protein detected by immunohistochemistry at 12 hours after iv infusion at 05 mgkg 

mrna delivery to and protein expression in hepatocytes with our proprietary lnps in nonhuman primate study 

our platform’s future improving and expanding our modalities 

we are committed to sustaining investment in our platform both in basic science to elucidate new mechanistic insights and in applied science to discover new technologies that harness these insights our platform investments have enabled six modalities to date most of which have already led to multiple development candidates and investigational medicines in our pipeline we believe that sustaining our investment in platform research and development will enable further improvements in the current modalities and will lead to the creation of new modalities both of which will benefit our clinical pipeline in the years ahead 

creating modalities with shared product features 

our approach to developing modalities 

within our platform we develop technologies that enable the development of mrna medicines for diverse applications when we identify technologies that we believe could enable a new group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features we call that group a “ modality ” while the programs within a modality may target diverse diseases they share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features the programs within a modality will also generally share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals as well as pharmaceutical properties programs within a modality often have correlated technology risk but because they pursue diverse diseases they often have uncorrelated biology risk we have created six modalities to date 

 when entering into a new modality our approach is consistent with our strategic principles and perspectives on risk management discussed previously the tenets of our approach are summarized below 

 illustrating our approach from our first modality to today 

we started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality because we believed this modality faced lower technical hurdles relative to other areas our early formulations of mrna tended to stimulate the immune system which would present a challenge to therapeutics but was a desired feature for vaccines in addition many potential prophylactic vaccine antigens are wellcharacterized allowing us to reduce biology risk lastly the dosing regimens for vaccines require as few as one or two administrations and generally involve relatively low doses 

for our first programs in this modality we chose our h10n8 and h7n9 pandemic influenza vaccines each requiring expression of a single membrane protein we chose to pursue two programs in two separate but parallel clinical trials to establish the flexibility of our platform 

when both programs met our goals for safety tolerability and pharmacology we accelerated and expanded our vaccine pipeline to include multiple commercially meaningful and increasingly complex vaccines these included a combination vaccine designed to protect against two unrelated respiratory viruses human metapneumovirus or hmpv and human parainfluenza 3 or piv3 and a vaccine that combines six different mrnas our cytomegalovirus or cmv vaccine to express a complex pentameric antigen we also sought strategic alliances with defense advanced research projects or darpa biomedical advanced research development authority or barda and merck  co or merck to allow us to rapidly expand our pipeline and complement our capabilities with their expertise 

over time we have taken on more challenging applications and technological hurdles with each successive modality but we have also tried to build upon our prior experiences to manage risk for example in our cancer vaccines modality we are now applying our technology to elicit t cell responses to potentially recognize and eradicate cancer as a logical extension of our prophylactic vaccines 

modality having demonstrated local expression of protein in our vaccines we expanded into local therapeutic applications for example in our intratumoral immunooncology modality we are seeking to use local expression to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming tumor microenvironments we can also use local expression to drive regenerative processes as in our vegfa program most recently we have expanded into two new modalities that use systemic delivery of mrna to encode secreted or intracellular proteins we have moved multiple programs in these areas into development for the treatment of diseases as varied as rare genetic disorders preventing viral infections or treating heart failure 

how modalities build our pipeline 

we believe our portfolio of modalities—each with distinct technological and biological risk profiles—allows us to maximize longterm value for patients and investors we see our six current modalities as six distinct multiproduct pipelines that represent different risk profiles and benefit from common infrastructure and a shared platform technology we believe the high technology correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of the pipeline in that modality based on learnings from the initial programs we believe the lower technology correlation between modalities allows us to compartmentalize the technology risks 

we believe our ongoing investments in our platform will lead to the identification of additional new modalities in the future and will expand the diversity of our pipeline 

executing on our broad pipeline 

in order to capitalize on the breadth of the mrna opportunity we built a set of capabilities across the drug development value chain to enable us to efficiently execute on many pipeline programs in parallel 

mrnas encode proteins across diverse biology using the same chemical building blocks arranged into different sequences this lends itself to common rules when designing a new mrna medicine and common processes for manufacturing we have invested in scalable infrastructure built on a digital backbone and enabled by automation to advance a large pipeline of mrna programs in parallel 

our capabilities and infrastructure are grouped into three basic units or engines that are applied at different stages of the drug development value chain as shown in the following figure 

our current pipeline programs utilize our research engine and early development engine we are starting to build the late stage development and commercial engine to handle the further advancement of our programs each of these engines integrates critical internal capabilities with outsourced flexible capacity 

our  research engine  enables us to advance new product ideas into development candidates via our drug discovery efforts and includes infrastructure to enable rapid supply of thousands of preclinical mrnas for research involving  in vitro  and  in vivo  experiments in order to accelerate programs from idea to development candidate designation 

our  early development engine  enables progression of preclinical development candidates to investigational medicines upon ind filing or its equivalent through early clinical trials that seek to demonstrate human proof of concept or hpoc this includes internal and outsourced infrastructure for indenabling glp toxicology studies the scale up and cgmp manufacture of the investigational medicine initial regulatory submissions and the execution of clinical trials 

our  late stage development and commercial engine  is envisioned to enable progress of our investigational medicines from hpoc through latestage development to approval and eventual commercialization this is expected to include internal and outsourced infrastructure for cgmp manufacture for late stage development and commercial supply of products regulatory submissions and capabilities to execute later stage clinical trials 

all of these engines are supported and enabled by our integrated digital investments our focus on highly talented and motivated team members and our deep capital base 

our  digital infrastructure  facilitates efficient integration and control of virtually every aspect of what we do we design and implement digital operations to control or support complex workflows accelerate learnings across our enterprise realtime and provide deeper insights through analytical tools artificial intelligence and custom automation 

our  talented employees  drive our mission across this value chain for patients and investors our culture also plays an invaluable role in our execution at all levels in our organization an example of our commitment to the development of our employees is our investment in moderna university our extensive program of internal and external course offerings curated to meet the learning and development needs of our people 

our  capital  from our investors and strategic collaborators enables the scale required to execute on our pipeline we sought and continue to seek diverse funding sources of approximately 32 billion  in cash we have received through december 31 2018  08 billion  has been in the form of upfront payments milestone payments and option exercise payments from strategic collaborators such 

as astrazeneca and merck and 24 billion  has been from equity issuances in both private and public markets to a diverse set of global investors as of december 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and investments of 17 billion  

examples of our proprietary infrastructure 

our drug design studio enables rapid design of multiple mrnas 

as our scientists create new mrna concepts they can design mrnas for research and testing within days using our proprietary systems we utilize the softwarelike property of mrna in our proprietary webbased drug design studio our scientists request mrnas for a specific protein and the protein target is automatically converted to an initial optimized mrna sequence using our sequence designer module they can tailor entire mrnas from the 5’utr to the coding region to the 3’utr based on our everimproving proprietary learnings the mrna sequence is then further optimized using our proprietary bioinformatics algorithms our digital ordering then ensures rapid and accurate transmission of sequences to our modular synthesis robotics 

our high throughput systems facilitate rapid synthesis of research grade mrna 

once our scientists design mrnas we make them at a small scale to test them in cells or in animal models to see if our ideas will work we integrated the drug design studio mrna sequence into a modular synthesis system comprised of custom highthroughput automation for making up to 1000 orders of unique mrna sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks at 110 mg per lot the amounts required for testing in cells or animal models this has accelerated our learnings by allowing us to test many different mrnas in parallel 

our norwood manufacturing site provides modular and automated capacity that can scale with our pipeline 

manufacturing is strategically important to us and we believe we need to control a significant portion of our manufacturing supply chain we initially used an outsourced global supply chain to make our multicomponent mrna products however we believe that managing quality supply and timing in such a supply chain for cgmp material could increase our overall business risk accordingly we elected in 2016 to build our own manufacturing facility we opened our newly constructed 200000 square foot norwood manufacturing facility in july 2018 and brought multiple cgmp suites online thereby providing integration of our supply chain from raw materials to filled vials at a single site we can make mrna lipids and lnps at this site to control quality and supply while also potentially creating new manufacturing intellectual property we can readily flex the capacity at our norwood facility via its modular systems to produce up to 100 cgmp lots per year this capacity will support our current pipeline will enable significant future pipeline expansion and under certain scenarios could serve some commercial supply needs 

overview of our modalities 

at moderna we define a modality as a group of potential mrna medicines that share similar mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes to achieve shared product features typically programs within a modality will also share similar pharmacology profiles including the desired dose response the expected dosing regimen the target tissue for protein expression safety and tolerability goals and their pharmaceutical properties we have created six modalities to date 

 we believe our portfolio of modalities each with distinct technological and biological risk profiles allows us to maximize longterm value for patients and investors we see our six current modalities as six distinct multiproduct pipelines that represent different risk profiles and benefit from common infrastructure and a shared technology platform we believe the risk correlation within a modality allows us to rapidly accelerate the expansion of the pipeline in that modality based on learnings from the initial programs we believe the lower risk correlation between modalities allows us to mitigate the risks of expanding into new areas the cell map illustration of our pipeline in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” depicts the diversity of the biology of our pipeline across our six modalities 

i prophylactic vaccines modality overview 

we designed our prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent or control infectious diseases this modality currently includes eight programs all of which are vaccines against viruses the goal of any vaccine is to safely preexpose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen called an antigen so that the immune system is prepared to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future and prevent infection or disease 

within this modality our portfolio includes programs for both commercial and global health uses we have strategic alliances with merck on select commercial vaccines and barda and darpa on global health vaccine programs 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

prophylactic vaccines opportunity 

vaccines to prevent infectious diseases are one of the great innovations of modern medicine in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322 million americans from falling ill 21 million hospitalizations 732000 deaths 295 billion of direct costs and 13 trillion in social costs the commercial opportunity for vaccines is significant with more than 35 billion in annual worldwide sales of vaccines and with 16 different vaccine franchises each generating more than 500 million in annual worldwide sales in 2017 more innovative vaccines have been able to achieve pricing per regimen generally ranging from 5 to 20 times that of seasonal flu vaccines 

prophylactic vaccines product features 

we believe mrnabased vaccines offer several advantages including 

 prophylactic vaccines status and next steps 

our prophylactic vaccines modality currently includes eight programs six of which have entered into clinical trials of those six five of our programs based on the data observed have demonstrated desired pharmacology in the form of immunogenicity in their phase 1 clinical trials h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 rsv vaccine mrna1777 chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 and hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 for the zika vaccine mrna1325 although the phase 1 safety and tolerability data generated would permit additional dose escalation of mrna1325 our current development efforts are focused on our nextgeneration vaccine mrna1893 which has been shown to be 20 times more potent in nonhuman primate zika challenge studies we will not further develop mrna1325 the remaining clinical stage program cmv vaccine mrna1647 is in an ongoing phase 1 trial the next program in this modality a vzv vaccine mrna1278 is in preclinical development with an indenabling glp toxicology study in progress on the basis of the phase 1 results for the rsv vaccine mrna1777 merck has initiated planning for a phase 2a clinical trial we are working with merck to identify and advance improvements to the rsv vaccine 



for our commercial vaccine programs we expect the next series of milestones will involve the reporting of phase 1 safety and immunogenicity data from our cmv vaccine mrna1647 based on the data for the hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 we are planning a phase 1b trial in pediatric subjects as we look to develop this vaccine to address hmpv and piv3 childhood infections for the programs being conducted by our strategic collaborator merck the next milestones will be the potential start of the phase 2a trial for the rsv vaccine mrna1777 and the continued development of the vzv vaccine mrna1278 including completion of an indenabling glp toxicology program for our global health programs we do not intend to advance our h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 our h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 or our chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 through further clinical development without government or other thirdparty funding we are preparing an ind for submission to the fda for our zika vaccine mrna1893 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

ii cancer vaccines modality overview 

we designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens defined below this modality has two programs currently for neoantigen vaccines a personalized cancer vaccine or pcv program and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called kras both conducted in collaboration with merck the goal of a cancer vaccine is to safely expose the patient’s immune system to tumor related antigens known as neoantigens to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique to a patient as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

cancer vaccines opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from checkpoint inhibitors as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available therapies in addition treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms principally the local immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells which prevent either access to or recognition by t cells 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor t cell therapies have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens 

cancer vaccines product features 

we believe that mrna technology is an attractive approach for cancer vaccines for many reasons including 

 cancer vaccines status and next steps 

we are currently developing two programs within our cancer vaccines modality our personalized cancer vaccine program includes two vaccines mrna4157 and nci4650 mrna4157 is being developed in collaboration with merck and is in a multiplearm phase 1 trial nci4650 is being developed in collaboration with the national cancer institute or nci and is in an investigatorinitiated singlearm phase 1 trial the two vaccines differ in the neoantigen selection protocols used but are otherwise substantially the same 

our second program within this modality mrna5671 is a kras vaccine following successful preclinical development the investigational new drug application or ind for this program was transferred to merck who will sponsor the phase 1 trial 



we expect the next steps for the pcv programs mrna4157 and nci4650 to involve the continuing reporting of immunogenicity data from the phase 1 clinical trials in cancer patients and the commencement of a randomized phase 2 trial to assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab improves relapsefree survival compared to pembrolizumab alone the next steps for the kras vaccine mrna5671 include the completion of cgmp manufacturing and initiating a phase 1 trial in patients with certain kras mutations merck may choose to measure t cell responses in this phase 1 trial for kras vaccine mrna5671 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

iii intratumoral immunooncology modality overview 

we designed our intratumoral immunooncology modality to treat or cure cancer by transforming the tumor microenvironment to drive anticancer t cell responses against tumors this modality currently has three programs our mrna technology within this modality allows for the combination of multiple therapeutics that can be directly injected into a tumor with the goal of activating the tumor microenvironment to kill cancer cells in the injected tumor as well as in distal tumors known as the abscopal effect intratumoral administration allows for localized effect of these therapeutics that could be toxic if administered systemically 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

intratumoral immunooncology opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 there have been several advances in the treatment of cancer through immunemediated therapies in recent years however the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer remains poor especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement and are sometimes termed immunologically “cold” we aim to activate the tumor microenvironment with our mrna therapeutics in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors 

intratumoral immunooncology product features 

we believe our approach to immunooncology using our mrna medicines could complement checkpoint inhibitors and has several advantages over recombinant proteinbased drugs including 

 intratumoral immunooncology status and next steps 

we have three programs in this modality the first program in this modality ox40l mrna2416 was designed to overcome technological challenges in advancing this modality including engineering the mrna sequence to minimize offtarget effects utilizing our proprietary lnps to enhance safety and tolerability and to demonstrate expression of a membrane protein in patients ox40l mrna2416 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase 12 trial in the united states and protein expression has been demonstrated in a number of patients our second program ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 has dosed patients in a phase 1 study for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma our third program il12 medi1191 is being developed in collaboration with astrazeneca 

  



based on the ox40l mrna2416 clinical observations we have opted to expand the trial to a phase 2 expansion cohort in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma we plan to continue to collect phase 1 clinical trial data including biopsy data and commence dosing of the phase 2 cohort for ox40l mrna2416 in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma we plan to collect phase 1 clinical trial data including potential clinical responses for ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 we expect astrazeneca to initiate an openlabel international multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral injections of il12 medi1191 alone or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor and the ind for il12 medi1191 is open 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

iv localized regenerative therapeutics modality overview 

we designed our localized regenerative therapeutics modality to develop mrna medicines to address injured or diseased tissues our mrna technology in this modality allows for the local production of proteins that provide a therapeutic benefit in the targeted tissue the development of our program in this modality azd8601 for the local production of vegfa is being led by our strategic collaborator astrazeneca this program recently completed a phase 1ab clinical trial in which we observed both a dosedependent protein production and a pharmacologic effect as measured by changes in local blood flow in patients we believe this data provides clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

localized regenerative therapeutics opportunity 

there are multiple applications for tissue regeneration with astrazeneca we have focused on ischemic heart failure for the first program coronary artery disease the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle in 2015 coronary artery disease resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally 

localized regenerative therapeutics product features 

we believe our approach to localized regenerative therapeutics using mrna has several advantages over alternative approaches including 

 localized regenerative therapeutics status and next steps 

our localized vegfa program azd8601 which is being developed by astrazeneca has completed a phase 1ab trial to describe its safety tolerability protein production and activity in diabetic patients the study has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of demonstrating protein production and changes in blood flow post azd8601 administration in this trial azd8601 was administered by intradermal injection in the forearm skin of patients for single ascending doses these data are consistent with studies previously conducted in preclinical models we believe these data provide clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting    



astrazeneca has initiated a phase 2a trial for azd8601 in ischemic heart disease the phase 2a study is designed to provide initial safety and tolerability data in approximately 24 coronary artery bypass patients 

this program is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

v systemic secreted therapeutics modality overview 

we designed our systemic secreted therapeutics modality to increase levels of desired secreted proteins in circulation or in contact with the extracellular environment in order to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide secreted proteins such as antibodies or enzyme replacement therapies across a wide range of diseases such as heart failure infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases this modality has benefitted from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation this modality currently has three programs 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic secreted therapeutics opportunity 

the ability to systemically deliver mrna for a therapeutic effect would allow us to address a number of diseases of high unmet medical need systemically delivered secreted therapeutics address conditions often treated with recombinant proteins that are typically administered to the blood stream these current therapies include for example 

 systemic secreted therapeutics product features 

systemically delivered secreted therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins our potential advantages in these areas include 

 systemic secreted therapeutics status and next steps 

we have three systemic secreted therapeutics development candidates in our pipeline our secreted programs include our antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 relaxin azd7970 for the treatment of heart failure and fabry disease mrna3630 our antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 is currently being evaluated in an ongoing phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy adults that is randomized and placebocontrolled our second and third programs for relaxin azd7970 and fabry disease mrna3630 are currently in preclinical development 



we expect the next steps for the antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 program will be phase 1 clinical trial safety and serum antibody level data we plan to file inds and take our programs for relaxin azd7970 and fabry disease mrna3630 into the clinic for phase 1 testing 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

vi systemic intracellular therapeutics modality overview 

we designed our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality to increase levels of intracellular proteins using cells in the human body to produce proteins located in the cytosol or specific organelles of the cell to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide intracellular proteins such as intracellular enzymes and organellespecific proteins as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies our initial focus within this modality is on rare genetic diseases this modality currently has three programs

systemic intracellular therapeutics opportunity 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics focus on areas currently not addressable with recombinant proteins which are typically administered systemically and cannot reach the inside of the cell objectives for potential new therapies in this area include for example increasing the levels of 

 systemic intracellular therapeutics product features 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics we believe would allow us to target areas of biology that cannot be addressed using recombinant proteins our potential advantages in these areas include 

 systemic intracellular therapeutics status and next steps 

we have three systemic intracellular therapeutics development candidates in our pipeline our intracellular programs address methylmalonic acidemia or mma mrna3704 propionic acidemia or pa mrna3927 and phenylketonuria or pku mrna3283 



we have an open ind for mrna3704 for a planned phase 12 trial and the fda has also designated the investigation of mrna3704 for the treatment of isolated mma due to mut deficiency as a fast track development program we expect the next steps for mrna3704 will be phase 12 clinical trial safety proof of concept and biomarker data as of february 27 2019 20 mma patients and 12 pa patients had enrolled in our mma and pa global natural history study 

pa mrna3927 and pku mrna3283 are currently in preclinical development we plan to file inds and take our programs for pa mrna3927 and pku mrna3283 into the clinic for phase 1 testing 

each of these programs is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions”

in late 2014 we nominated our first development candidate and today have 20  development candidates in our pipeline with 11  currently in clinical trials on three different continents over 1000  subjects have been enrolled in our clinical trials since december 2015 our diverse pipeline comprises programs across six modalities and a broad range of therapeutic areas a modality is a group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features and the associated combination of mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes aspects of our pipeline have been supported through strategic alliances including with astrazeneca merck and vertex pharmaceuticals or vertex and governmentsponsored organizations and private foundations focused on global health initiatives including barda darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation 

our selection process for advancing new development candidates reflects both programspecific considerations as well as portfoliowide considerations programspecific criteria include among other relevant factors the severity of the unmet medical need the biology risk of our chosen target or disease the feasibility of clinical development the costs of development and the commercial opportunity portfoliowide considerations include the ability to demonstrate technical success for our platform components within a modality thereby increasing the probability of success and learnings for subsequent programs in the modality and in some cases in other modalities 

our pipeline is shown below in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs we believe the 20  programs in our pipeline represent only an initial wave of potential development candidates and that our platform over time may yield both multiple new programs within our existing modalities and the potential for multiple programs in new modalities

portfoliowide evidence in support of our platform and approach 

we have generated significant learnings across our portfolio that we believe provide compelling support for our approach and pipeline across a broad array of human diseases 

we and our strategic collaborators astrazeneca and merck have completed indenabling glp toxicology programs to support 15 opened inds 

with any new class of medicine safety and tolerability is an important consideration for patients and healthy individuals and helps to define the scope of application as part of establishing our modalities and initial development pipeline we conducted a large number of  in vivo  toxicology studies across a wide range of projects we have sponsored dozens of thirdparty or internallyconducted  in vivo  toxicology studies since our inception this includes more than 40 indenabling glp toxicology studies required for regulatory filings 

we currently have 20  development candidates in our pipeline fifteen indenabling glp toxicology programs have been completed and supported the opening of inds by regulators for 15 development candidates to date 

describing safety and tolerability — early stage clinical data from hundreds of subjects 

the translation of preclinical safety and tolerability into the clinic is a key step for each of our programs and in totality supports the creation of a new class of medicines we continue to generate safety and tolerability data across 11 investigational medicines over 1000 subjects have been enrolled in our clinical trials 

diverse production of many types of proteins 

our scientists in conjunction with scientists from merck and astrazeneca and other strategic collaborators have tested over 12000 unique mrna sequences in  in vitro  and  in vivo  preclinical studies this includes over 500  in   vivo  preclinical studies that were designed to show evidence of pharmacologic effect or the production of the desired protein these studies included the following types of proteins 

 direct and indirect clinical demonstration of protein production in humans across multiple modalities 

over our eight year history we have had 12 investigational medicines in clinical trials including our zika vaccine mrna1325 which we will not further develop after generating early stage safety and tolerability data we aim to demonstrate that the mrna administered makes the desired protein and creates the desired pharmacological effect we have observed protein production or a resulting pharmacological effect across a number of programs which is more fully described in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—program descriptions” 

pharmacologic effect—immunological responses 

in clinical data we have observed an ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies to viral antigens from our five most advanced prophylactic vaccine programs for our two influenza vaccines the rsv vaccine being developed in collaboration with merck the chikungunya vaccine being developed in collaboration with darpa and our hmpvpiv3 vaccine both the preclinical models and immune responses in humans showed increased antibody levels to pathogenic viral antigens for pcv mrna4157 which is the most advanced program in clinical development within the cancer vaccines modality we have observed antigen specific t cell responses in some patients in the ongoing clinical trial for ox40l mrna2416 in the intratumoral immunooncology modality we have observed early indications of the ability to impact the tumor microenvironment from tumor regression in injected lesions and an adjacent uninjected lesion 

we have demonstrated the ability of our intratumoral immunooncology programs to transform immunologically cold tumor microenvironments in preclinical studies for our ox40l ox40lil23il36γ and il12 programs these responses include longterm t cell responses that eliminate tumors in animal models and makes them able to combat a second tumor challenge indicating immunological memory we also have preclinical evidence of immunological responses for programs in our cancer vaccines modality including personalized cancer vaccines and kras vaccine 

pharmacologic effect—enzymedriven changes in metabolic phenotypes 

we have tested our ability to impact metabolic phenotypes via the expression of over 24 different types of proteins we have also progressed four development candidates methylmalonic acidemia or mma propionic acidemia or pa and phenylketonuria or pku and fabry disease through early preclinical development efforts we have demonstrated the ability of our mrna development candidates to drive metabolic change in animal models for mma pa pku and fabry disease 

pharmacologic effect—via binding activity andor signaling activity 

we have demonstrated the ability of cells preclinically to make and secrete antibodies and soluble modulating factors that exert their pharmacologic activity by binding to targets and in some cases having a signaling effect for example for our antibody against chikungunya virus we have demonstrated an ability to make an antibody against chikungunya virus and its ability to drive passive immunity in animal models for our relaxin program we have demonstrated an ability to make relaxin as a secreted and engineered protein which can impact heart failure in preclinical models 

pharmacologic effect from proteins encoded by mrna—next wave of potential clinical data 

we have several programs currently in or taking steps to enter phase 1 clinical trials where we will measure the pharmacology of our expressed proteins as well as direct or indirect evidence of protein production these programs include 

 twelve firstinhuman trials since december 2015 and clinical material supply 

we invest in capabilities and infrastructure that enable us to execute at scale we first dosed a subject in a clinical trial occurred in december 2015 we or our strategic collaborators have achieved firstinhuman for 12 different mrna investigational medicines eleven of those programs were run and sponsored by us 

each firstinhuman or fih trial involved successful completion of one or more indenabling glp toxicology studies successful technical development scaleup and cgmp manufacture of adequate quantities of mrna drug product ind or cta regulatory filings and interactions with health authorities and successful clinical operations startup activities we or our strategic collaborators have run clinical trials in the united states europe and australia 

conclusion 

we believe that this body of preclinical and clinical data is indicative of our significant progress and provides a strong foundation for our ongoing mission to create a new class of medicines for patients 

program descriptions 

using our platform we have found solutions to many scientific and technical challenges in order to develop the desirable features of our potential mrna medicines for different applications a “modality” refers to a group of potential mrna medicines with shared product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes 

each of our modalities is designed to overcome the challenges of delivering the right amount of mrna to the right tissue at the right times across a variety of applications in advancing our platform technologies and identifying new product features for novel mrna medicines we may designate additional modalities 

we started with prophylactic vaccines as our first modality as we believed there would be lower technical hurdles for vaccines compared to therapeutics early formulations of mrna tended to stimulate the immune system which is a desired feature for a vaccine but not therapeutics in addition antigens for many viruses tend to be wellcharacterized and of lower biology risk also dosing regimens for vaccines can require as few as one or two administrations 

i program descriptions in our prophylactic vaccines modality 

we designed our prophylactic vaccines modality to prevent or control infectious diseases since we nominated our first program in late 2014 this modality has grown to currently include eight programs all of which are vaccines against viruses the goal of any vaccine is to safely preexpose the immune system to a small quantity of a protein from a pathogen called an antigen so that the immune system is prepared to fight the pathogen if exposed in the future and prevent infection or disease 

within this modality our portfolio includes programs for both commercial and global health uses we have strategic alliances with merck on select commercial vaccines and with the biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda and the defense advanced research projects agency or darpa on global health vaccine programs 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

opportunity 

vaccines to prevent infectious diseases are one of the great innovations of modern medicine in the united states alone the centers for disease control and prevention estimates that childhood vaccinations given in the past two decades will in total prevent 322 million americans from falling ill 21 million hospitalizations 732000 deaths 295 billion of direct costs and 13 trillion in social costs the commercial opportunity for vaccines is significant with more than 35 billion in annual worldwide sales including 16 different vaccine products each generating more than 500 million in annual worldwide sales in 2017 

our approach 

our vaccine research approach starts by identifying the antigens most likely to induce a protective immune response against a specific infectious disease we test one or more antigens  in vivo  in multiple animal species the immune response can be measured in multiple ways including 

 clinical correlates of protection are levels of immune response that when achieved in response to vaccination are associated with protection against infection or disease influenza for instance has an established correlate of protection based on the serum hemagglutination inhibition or hai assay hai titers of 40 or above are associated with 50 to 70 protection against influenza however such correlates are generally only available for approved vaccines as a result new vaccines generally but not always have to demonstrate efficacy against clinical disease before being approved our first two programs in this modality are h10n8 and h7n9 vaccines for an established antigen with hai clinical correlates 

typically subjects require only a limited number of administrations of a vaccine to confer longlasting protection many of our mrna vaccines are developed to be administered in two doses one to prime the immune response and the second to boost it in cases where 

populations have been exposed to the virus previously such as with many respiratory viruses a subject might be administered a single dose of an mrna vaccine 

we believe that our potential mrna vaccines will have a more standardized manufacturing process compared to traditional vaccines that would provide considerable advantages current approaches include attenuation and replication of live viruses and cellculture methods to produce recombinant antigens these approaches require considerable customization compared to the standardized process of producing mrna vaccines 

we believe the inherent characteristics of mrna coupled with our strategy to execute at scale will allow us to bring potential mrna vaccines to the clinic in a relatively short period of time we have chosen to be methodical for our early programs to understand the technology risks within the modality if needed as in the case of a pandemic we could potentially exploit the scalability of mrna medicines and our infrastructure to rapidly advance a potential mrna vaccine to the clinic

rsv vaccine mrna1777 summary 

our rsv vaccine program completed dosing in a phase 1 clinical trial and based on the interim data and other considerations our strategic collaborator merck has initiated phase 2a planning 

respiratory syncytial virus or rsv is one of the most common causes of respiratory disease in infants and the elderly more than 86000 children and about 177000 older adults are hospitalized due to rsv associated respiratory infections each year in the united states to date no effective vaccine to prevent rsv has been approved and the only approved prophylaxis treatment is limited to the monoclonal antibody palivizumab marketed as synagis in the united states for pediatric patients at high risk for rsv infection in collaboration with merck we designed mrna1777 to encode a membraneanchored version of stabilized prefusion f protein the main target of potently neutralizing and protective antibodies this vaccine is administered as a single dose with no boost the phase 1 trial is currently ongoing in australia for which we are the sponsor merck has initiated plans for a phase 2a trial for which merck will be the sponsor in addition we are working with merck to identify and advance improvements to the rsv vaccine 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 disease overview 

rsv impacts young children and older adults and no approved vaccine exists today 

rsv causes upper and lower respiratory tract illness worldwide and is transmitted primarily via aerosolized droplets from an infected person or via contamination of environmental surfaces with infectious secretions following introduction of rsv into the nose or upper respiratory tract the virus replicates primarily in the ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium upper respiratory symptoms typically begin within several days of exposure in healthy adults the infection may remain confined to the upper respiratory tract however in those with compromised immune systems such as premature infants the elderly or individuals with underlying respiratory disease lower respiratory tract infections commonly occur and may manifest as wheezing bronchiolitis pneumonia hospitalization or even death infections with rsv follow a seasonal pattern occurring primarily in the northern hemisphere between the months of november and april and in the southern hemisphere primarily between march and october 

more than 86000 children are hospitalized due to rsv infection each year in the united states about 177000 older adults are hospitalized each year in the united states due to rsvassociated respiratory infections with approximately 14000 deaths as a result rsv infection is common in adults over the age of 60 years occurring in an average of 55 of older adults every season and resulting in physician’s visits for 17 of infected older adults the cost of rsv disease to society can be considerable 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 our product concept 

prevent rsv infections with an improved rsv antigen using a single vaccine dose 

our rsv investigational medicine mrna1777 includes an mrna encoding an engineered form of the rsv fusion f glycoprotein stabilized in the prefusion conformation in an lnp the f protein is present as a homotrimer on the surface of rsv the prefusion conformation of the f protein interacts with a host cell membrane and the conformational change from prefusion to postfusion drives virus fusion with a host cell the majority of rsvspecific neutralizing antibodies in convalescent people are directed to epitopes present only on the prefusion conformation of the f protein the prefusion state of the f protein elicits a superior neutralizing antibody response compared to the postfusion state in animal studies conducted by others a schematic of the prefusion f protein on the surface of a host cell with sites recognized by neutralizing antibodies is depicted in the figure below the inset on the left of the figure shows the intended design of the mrna formulated in lnp and the inset on the right shows the intended prefusion f protein on the surface of the cell we believe that neutralizing antibodies elicited by mrna1777 may lead to an efficacious rsv vaccine 

rsv vaccine mrna1777 preclinical information 

mrna vaccines encoding different versions of the prefusion f protein have been evaluated in mice cotton rats and african green monkeys or agm these studies demonstrate that mrna vaccines encoding the prefusion f protein induce robust neutralizing antibody titers in preclinical species tested do not lead to vaccineenhanced respiratory disease evaluated in cotton rats and are protective against rsv challenge evaluated in cotton rats and agm the data for a study in agm are shown in the figure below in this study one group of agm 4 per group was vaccinated intramuscularly with vaccine a second group was infected with 55 log 10  plaque forming units or pfu of rsv strain a2 intranasally as a positive control and a third group received no vaccine as a negative control each on weeks 0 4 and 8 serum neutralizing antibody titers or sn titers were measured on the indicated weeks and are shown in panel a all animals were challenged intranasally and intratracheally on study week 10 on multiple time points after the challenge virus present in bronchoalveolar lavage or bal fluid was quantified by plaque assay as shown in panel b in this study we observed an increase in serum neutralizing titers with each vaccine dose the animals that received mrna1777 showed complete protection no virus detected in lungs similar to the control group immunized with rsv a2 these results are shown in the figures below

rsv vaccine mrna1777 clinical data 

the phase 1 trial in australia has generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity through day 90 based on the interim data and other such considerations merck has initiated planning for a phase 2a trial 

the phase 1 trial for rsv vaccine has met its objectives of assessing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1777 versus placebo including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for rsv vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed a humoral immune response as measured by neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a for dose levels one two and three of mrna1777 based on the interim data and other considerations merck has initiated planning for a phase 2a trial 

the mrna1777 phase 1 study is a randomized partially doubleblind placebocontrolled doseescalation firstinhuman study to describe the safety tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy adult subjects in australia we are the sponsor for this trial the study evaluated three dose levels in healthy younger adults and 4 dose levels in healthy older adults all subjects were given a single intramuscular injection the key objectives of the study included 

 the key endpoints for the study included safety and tolerability of mrna1777 

the study is being conducted in two parts part a evaluates healthy younger subjects ages   18 and   49 years and part b evaluates healthy older subjects ages   60 and   79 years there are four dose levels where the highest dose or dose four is twelve times the lowest dose or dose one and dose three the second highest dose is eight times the lowest dose in part a dose levels one two and three are being evaluated the safety data from the sentinel safety group for each dose level was reviewed before permitting enrollment of the expansion group within that dose level cohort the safety data of each expansion group was reviewed before 

permitting dose escalationenrollment of the sentinel safety group at the next dose level in part b all four dose levels are being evaluated the first sentinel dose cohort was triggered after review of the first sentinel dose level cohort in part a the safety data from the sentinel safety group for each dose level cohort was reviewed before permitting enrollment of the expansion group within that dose level cohort the safety data of each expansion group was reviewed before permitting dose escalationenrollment of the sentinel safety group at the next dose level part b includes the highest dose level dose four which was enrolled after review of the available safety and immunogenicity data of the preceding part b dose level cohorts expansion groups in part a and b were both randomized 31 mrna1777 placebo 

this 200subject study is fully enrolled and all subjects have been dosed as of april 9 2018 we have the majority of data through three months 90 days postvaccination for younger subjects in dose levels one and two and for older subjects in doses one two and three based on the interim data as of april 2018 dose levels one two and three of mrna1777 were observed to elicit a humoral immune response as measured by neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a neutralizing antibody titers against rsv b dose level three only dose levels one and two have yet to be assayed absolute serum antibody titers to rsv prefusion f protein and rsv postfusion f protein and competing antibody titers to rsv prefusion f protein in a dosedependent manner up to dose level two in both younger and older subjects the immune response measured by neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a in older adults that received dose level three of mrna1777 was not higher than that of the subjects that received dose level two we have observed an increase in neutralizing antibody titers relative to placebo in younger adult subjects in panel a and older adult subjects in panel b who received our rsv vaccine as shown in the figure below in the figure geometric mean titer and 95 confidence interval are depicted by time for neutralizing antibody titers against rsv a for older and younger subjects at day ninety between 10 and 19 healthy younger subjects and between 11 and 27 healthy older subjects were tested at each dose level based on the interim data and other considerations merck has initiated planning for a phase 2a trial

in addition based on interim data as of april 2018 we observed an increase in t cell response relative to baseline at day 15 and day 60 in both healthy younger and healthy older adult subjects vaccinated with doses two and three of mrna1777 

based on interim safety data as of april 9 2018 mrna1777 was well tolerated with no dose limiting toxicities at dose levels one two and three in both the younger and older adults as of september 2018 the highest dose level which was evaluated in older subjects only dose level four was not as well tolerated as the lower dose levels however across all treatment arms there were no treatmentrelated serious adverse events or saes treatment emergent adverse events or teaes leading to withdrawals adverse events or aes of special interest or new onset of chronic illnesses or autoimmune disorders in either of the age cohorts there were no patterns in clinically significant laboratory abnormalities 

as of september 19 2018 we have observed 15 saes in nine subjects all of which were deemed unrelated to study product these saes occurred approximately one to ten months from receipt of study product and included aortic aneurysm repair paralytic ileus spinal decompression death from preexisting cardiomyopathy hernia transient ischemic attack peripheral vascular disorder vasovagal syncope diagnosis of nonsmall cell lung cancer anterior cruciate ligament tear left knee tendon tear right knee tendon tear left patella dislocation right patella dislocation and bilateral patella tendon repair 

the trial is ongoing and consistent with the study protocol we remain blinded to treatment at the individual subject level and continue to collect safety tolerability and immunogenicity data through day 365 of the study based on the interim safety tolerability and immunogenicity data merck has initiated plans for a phase 2a trial for mrna1777 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 summary 

our cmv program targets congenital cmv infections to reduce or prevent birth defects 

congenital cytomegalovirus or cmv infection is the leading cause of birth defects in the united states despite several attempts to date there is no vaccine approved to prevent congenital transmission of cmv we believe that in addition to the glycoprotein b or gb protein antigen a successful cmv vaccine would need to include the pentamer a 5protein membranebound antigen complex required for epithelial endothelial and myeloid cell infection by the virus a cmv vaccine containing the pentamer as a recombinant protein or a replication defective virus is complex to make and scale we used our platform to generate an mrna vaccine designed to make the pentamer in its natural membranebound conformation this investigational medicine is designed to prevent or control cmv infection and includes five mrnas encoding for the pentamer as well as one mrna encoding for cmv gb that has previously demonstrated partial clinical efficacy our program is currently being tested in a phase 1 clinical trial in the united states 

cmv mrna1647 disease overview 

cmv is a major cause of birth defects with no approved vaccine 

human cmv is a common human pathogen and member of the herpes virus family seropositivity demonstrating prior exposure to virus increases with age and is approximately 4060 in women of childbearing potential in the united states however general awareness of cmv is not high less than 1020 of adults are aware of cmv and most healthy adults after initial primary cmv infection do not have symptoms however approximately 0607 of newborns are congenitally infected by cmv annually in industrialized countries congenital cmv results from infected mothers transmitting the virus to their unborn child and it is the leading cause of birth defects with approximately 25000 newborns per year in the united states infected birth defects occur in approximately 20 of infected babies and include permanent neurodevelopmental disabilities which can include hearing loss often permanent vision impairment varying degrees of learning disability decreased muscle strength and coordination and even death some studies report approximately onethird of infants with severe congenital disease will die within the first year of life and the survivors their caregivers and health systems bear significant longterm burdens 

there is currently no available vaccine for cmv and many previous attempts at developing a vaccine to reduce or prevent congenital transmission have been missing a key antigen the pentamer we believe the pentamer is critical for the infection of epithelial endothelial and myeloid cells by the virus we believe the pentamer was not included in certain prior recombinant protein vaccine attempts due to the complexity of producing it as a multiunit antigen complex prior vaccine studies demonstrated insufficient efficacy against cmv infection and limited durability of immune response a vaccine that leads to durable immunity in women of childbearing age would address a critical unmet need in the prevention of congenital cmv infection 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 our product concept 

we are developing a single vaccine with complex antigens to prevent or control infection 

our ability to generate a multiantigen vaccine enables us to combine a traditional target antigen gb with the pentamer in order to specifically focus the immune system on these important antigens we believe this gives us greater potential to produce neutralizing antibodies that can block cmv transmission from the mother to the fetus our approach to block transmission could either be 

 unlike a proteinbased or liveattenuated vaccine our mrna instructs cells to specifically make predetermined antigens with a structure that mimics the one presented to the immune system by the virus thus focusing the immune system on these important antigens 

mrna1647 comprises six mrnas that encode for these known hardtomake cmv antigens in a proprietary lnp 



an illustration of our proposed approach for cmv is shown in the figure below 

cmv vaccine mrna1647 preclinical information 

we have published preclinical data for our cmv vaccine 

we have demonstrated that the pentamer and gb mrnas can elicit potent and durable antibody titers against the antigens in mice and nonhuman primates and have published these results in  vaccine  in 2018 in one study mice were immunized with the pentamer and gb mrnas encapsulated in our proprietary lnp serum samples were taken from the mice at specific timepoints post vaccination postvaccination neutralizing titers were measured by admixing serial dilutions of each sample with cmv virus incubating the mixture in a human primary epithelial cell culture and counting the number of infected cells we used cytogam an approved product for prevention of cmv in transplant patients as a control in our experiment cytogam is cytomegalovirus immune globulin from pooled plasma of cmv seropositive donors the table below shows the neutralization antibody titers in epithelial cells for escalating vaccine doses in mice demonstrating our ability to generate neutralizing antibodies we also observed that at the highest dose our mrna vaccine generated a response more than 75fold higher than cytogam at estimated clinical levels in addition we have also observed that the pentamer and gb mrnas can elicit strong t cell responses

cmv vaccine mrna1647 clinical plan 

we are currently conducting a phase 1 trial in the united states 

this phase 1 trial is a randomized observerblinded placebocontrolled doseranging study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of mrna1647 in healthy adults in the united states the study is designed to administer the vaccine as a 3dose vaccination schedule 0 2 and 6 months at dose levels of 30 90 180 and 300 µg and a dose level to be determined depending on safety review of arm 1 in both cmvseronegative and cmvseropositive subjects key objectives of the study include the evaluation of 



key endpoints for the study include safety tolerability and reactogenicity 

subsequent to the initiation of our phase 1 study for mrna1647 we developed a modified manufacturing process that demonstrated improved pharmaceutical properties in preclinical testing we elected to introduce this modified process into mrna1647 under the same ind consequently prior to our receipt of any immunogenicity data we modified our trial design to test the original and modified manufacturing process for mrna1647 

the trial schematic is shown in the figure below our phase 1 trial comprises doseescalation phase a doseescalation and doseselection phases b and sentinelexpansion phase c only cmvseronegative subjects are enrolled into doseescalation phases a and b and the sentinel cohorts of phase c and both cmvseronegative and seropositive subjects are enrolled at a 11 ratio into doseselection phases a and b and the expansion cohorts of phase c doseescalation phase a evaluated mrna1647 manufactured with the process originally filed in the ind and phases b and c are evaluating mrna1647 manufactured with a modified process for doseescalation phases a and b there is sequential enrollment of subjects into the 30 90 or 180 µg dose levels of study vaccine or placebo starting at the 30 µg dose level internal safety review of all subjects at each dose level permit enrollment of subjects into the next dose level for doseescalation phases a and b the safety monitoring committee or smc will review the safety data from all subjects after the second vaccination to permit enrollment into the corresponding doseselection phase since doseescalation phase a included the mrna1647 manufactured using the process originally filed in the ind and we prefer the modified manufacturing process included in phases b and c the drug product manufactured using the original manufacturing process is not being progressed to doseselection phase c is split into arm 1 and arm 2 with arm 1 enrolling subjects into the 300 µg dose level and arm 2 enrolling subjects into a dose level to be determined depending on safety review of arm 1 

doseescalation phases a and b have completed all vaccinations based on unblinded smc reviews of safety data after the second vaccination at the 180 µg dose level in phases a and b the smc approved continuation of the trial as of march 6 2019 103 subjects have received the first vaccination in the doseselection phase b of mrna1647 and 33 of those subjects have received the second vaccination given the blinded safety and tolerability profile observed we plan to test two higher dose levels in sentinelexpansion phase c results from this phase 1 trial will inform the dose levels of mrna1647 that we plan to test in a phase 2 trial 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 summary 

we are developing a vaccine to address two viruses that are leading causes of respiratory infection 

human metapneumovirus or hmpv and human parainfluenza virus 3 or piv3 are important causes of respiratory tract infections in children despite the substantial impact hmpv and piv3 have on human health attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to rsv to date no vaccine to prevent hmpv or piv3 infections has been approved our platform allows us to combine mrnas encoding antigens for the two pathogens in one combination vaccine enabling a single vaccine that could protect against both respiratory infections in our approach we utilize mrna sequences encoding for the membrane f proteins for each of the viruses we have developed experience with the related f protein from our rsv program with merck mrna1653 is currently being tested in a phase 1 trial in the united states 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 disease overview 

hmpv and piv3 have a substantial impact on human health yet have lagged in research and attention relative to rsv 

there is no approved vaccine for hmpv although this rna virus has been determined to be one of the more frequent causes of upper and lower respiratory tract infections hmpv has been detected in 4 to 15 of patients with acute respiratory infections hmpv causes disease primarily in young children but can also infect adults the elderly and immunocompromised individuals clinical signs of infection range from a mild upper respiratory tract infection to lifethreatening severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia hmpv was discovered in 2001 and identified as a leading cause of respiratory infection 

there is no approved vaccine for piv3 although this rna virus is recognized as an important cause of respiratory tract infections in children infections from parainfluenza virus or piv account for up to 7 of acute respiratory infections among children younger than 5 years of the four piv types identified piv3 most frequently results in infections and leads to the more serious lower respiratory tract infections compared to the other three piv types though piv3 related infections were identified in the past awareness of their burden to patients and hospitals has risen over the past several years 

the majority of hmpv or piv3associated hospitalizations in children occur under the age of 2 years despite the substantial impact hmpv and piv3 have on human health attention and research on these viruses have lagged relative to rsv awareness of hospitalizations due to hmpv or piv3 infections have risen and we believe that a single vaccine intended for active immunization of infants and toddler against both hmpv and piv3 would be valuable previous attempts at developing a vaccine have focused on only hmpv or piv alone with no known attempts at a combination vaccine 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 our product concept 

our approach is to develop a combination vaccine for all infants and toddlers 

mrna1653 is a single investigational vaccine consisting of two distinct mrna sequences that encode the membrane f proteins of hmpv and piv3 coformulated in our proprietary lnp as shown in the figure below 

hmpvpiv3 vaccine mrna1653 preclinical information 

our mrna vaccine is immunogenic in multiple species 

we have evaluated multiple combinations for hmpvpiv3 mrna vaccines encoding fulllength f proteins for hmpv and piv3 viruses in mice sprague dawley rats cotton rats and african green monkeys or agm each following intramuscular or im injection these studies demonstrate that mrna encoding for f proteins from these viruses induce robust neutralizing antibody titers in all species tested for example neutralizing antibody titers for mrna encoding for f proteins of hmpv and piv3 encapsulated in lnp in mice are shown in the figure below c57bl6 mice were immunized with 033 2 or 12 µg of formulated material intramuscularly on study days 1 and 29 neutralizing antibody titers were measured in serum collected on day 43 results are represented as geometric mean titers or gmt of seven mice per group in the figure below neutralizing antibody titers in mice after immunization with mrna for hmpv and piv3 in our proprietary lnp by hmpv left panel and piv3 right panel are depicted along with the lower limit of quantification or lloq of the assay 



neutralizing antibodies are thought to be important for protection against hmpv and piv3 the titer of neutralizing antibodies induced by natural infection from hmpv or piv3 can be used to benchmark the titers induced by our hmpvpiv3 vaccine in preclinical models and in our clinical trial we determined the geometric mean neutralizing antibody titer for 15 seropositive adult donors to be 3807 range 499 to 20751 for hmpv and 263 range 47 to   1024 for piv3 our hmpvpiv3 mrna vaccine induces a similar neutralizing antibody titer in mice after 2 vaccinations of the dose levels evaluated as shown in the figure above and we believe it has the potential to confer protection in humans 

we have demonstrated that our hmpv and piv3 mrna combination vaccine does not lead to vaccineenhanced respiratory disease evaluated in cotton rats and is protective against hmpv or piv3 viral challenge evaluated in cotton rats and agm

the mrna1653 phase 1 study is a blinded randomized observerblind placebocontrolled dose ranging firstinhuman study to evaluate the safety and tolerability reactogenicity and immunogenicity of mrna1653 in healthy adult subjects in the united states the study evaluates four dose levels of mrna1653 25 75 150 and 300 µg administered intramuscularly at day one and month one with the onemonth immunization randomized to be mrna1653 or placebo in the dose selection phase of the study 

the key objectives of the study include evaluating 

 the key endpoints for the study include safety and tolerability of mrna1653 

the schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below in the doseescalation phase there is sequential enrollment into one of the four dose levels of mrna1653 or placebo advancement to the next dose level is permitted after an internal safety review in the doseescalation phase five subjects will be randomly assigned in a 41 ratio to receive mrna1653 or placebo the safety monitoring committee or smc reviews safety data after doseescalation enrollment is completed to permit enrollment into the doseselection phase at the three highest dose levels with acceptable safety profiles in addition the smc periodically reviews safety data during the doseselection phase 

the study is fully enrolled with 124 subjects and subjects have received both doses based on an unblinded evaluation of safety data from the doseescalation phase by the smc the three highest dose levels 75 150 and 300 µg are being evaluated in the doseselection phase the study is currently in the followup phase 

interim data from the phase 1 trial showed that a single vaccination with mrna1653 boosted serum neutralization titers against hmpv and piv3 and that the magnitude of the boost was similar at all dose levels tested consistent with prior exposure to hmpv and piv3 all study participants had neutralizing antibodies against both viruses at baseline one month after a single mrna1653 vaccination the hmpv neutralization titers were approximately sixfold greater than baseline and piv3 neutralization titers were approximately threefold greater than baseline based on geometric mean ratios a second mrna1653 vaccination one month after 

the first vaccination did not further boost antibody titers mrna1653 was found to be generally well tolerated no saes adverse events of special interest or adverse events leading to withdrawal were reported injection site pain was the most commonly reported ae and the most common grade 3 ae we plan to further evaluate mrna1653 in the clinic including in a phase 1b trial in pediatric subjects

prophylactic vaccines global health programs 

our global health portfolio for prophylactic vaccines seeks to leverage our mrna technology to address epidemic and pandemic diseases we are currently working with strategic collaborators such as barda and darpa to fund and support our programs within this area the first programs in this portfolio h10n8 vaccine and h7n9 vaccine helped identify and overcome the technical challenges with mrna vaccines and could eventually address pandemics for these viruses we have also gone from mrna sequence to a firstinhuman trial for zika vaccine in twelve months we have leveraged our learnings to rapidly advance a potential mrna vaccine for a zika pandemic as we continue to build infrastructure and capabilities in the research engine and early development engine we believe we can help address future pandemics rapidly 

h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 summary 

our h10n8 and h7n9 investigational vaccines demonstrate the potential of our platform to respond to an influenza pandemic 

influenza is one of the most variable and deadly infectious diseases ranging from 1200056000 deaths per year in the united states alone the antigens in circulating seasonal influenza strains change slightly which is called antigenic drift from one year to the next necessitating a change in the vaccine to match the new strains potential pandemic influenza strains can arise very quickly from substantial changes in antigens which is called antigenic shift and because preexisting immunity is nonexistent in some populations they can be pathogenic addressing a potential pandemic requires the ability to produce an effective vaccine rapidly we believe that our platform enables the rapid development of safe and effective vaccines as a proof of concept we developed vaccines for h10n8 and h7n9 avian influenza strains where there is a quantitative correlate for protection in humans hemagglutinin inhibition or hai titer of   140 we have observed tolerability and immunogenicity in phase 1 clinical trials for both mrna vaccines for h10n8 and h7n9 and have published the interim data for h10n8 in  molecular therapy  in 2017 we do not intend to progress these programs through clinical development on our own we may advance these programs with government or other grant funding 

h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 disease overview 

traditional vaccines cannot respond easily to a new influenza pandemic 

influenza a is an rna virus with a genome packed into eight individual gene segments that code for at least eleven functional proteins needed for infection replication and evasion of host antiviral responses the two major glycoproteins expressed on the surface of the virion are hemagglutinin or ha and neuraminidase or na both of which are crucial for infection ha mediates viral entry into host cells by binding to sialic acid containing receptors on the host cell surface and causing fusion of viral and host endosomal membranes na mediates enzymatic cleavage of the viral receptor at late stages of infection allowing for the release of progeny virions 

influenza a viruses infect a variety of species including birds pigs sea mammals and humans wild aquatic birds serve as the reservoir of influenza a viruses infecting avian and mammalian species although many of these viruses are nonpathogenic in birds and most do not infect humans in recent decades some avian influenza viruses such as h10n8 and h7n9 have crossed the species barrier to cause human disease 

there have been five epidemics of human infection due to h7n9 totaling over 1500 cases with mortality rates of 3447 to date there have been three reported cases of h10n8 of which two have been fatal for both h10n8 and h7n9 severe or fatal infections are characterized by rapid progression to respiratory failure within days of initial symptoms 

there are efforts ongoing to develop a h7n9 vaccine and a universal flu vaccine that covers h10n8 however we believe the use of traditional methods to produce these vaccines can lead to several shortcomings in the vaccine these include 

 h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 our product concept 

our platform can bring mrna encoding for influenza ha antigen to clinical testing rapidly 

our h10n8 and h7n9 influenza vaccine programs are each based on the mrna sequence for the cell viral ha membrane protein in a legacy lnp mrna1440 encodes for the ha protein of the h10n8 strain and mrna1851 encodes for the ha protein of the h7n9 strain 

we believe that mrna technology offers several advantages to traditional approaches of producing these vaccines including 

 h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 preclinical information 

we have observed immunogenicity of our mrna h10n8 vaccine in multiple species 

the level of a vaccine’s protection against influenza infection is traditionally measured using the hai assay the european medicines agency or ema and us food and drug administration or fda have endorsed hai titers of   140 to indicate an antibody level considered to be 50 protective against infection this benchmark was based on data from inactivated vaccines and varies with age group and setting 

proofofconcept for the use of mrna vaccines encoding the ha protein from h10n8 has been demonstrated in murine studies after a single dose of h10n8 vaccine mice exhibited antibody production sufficient to achieve hai titers of   140 which is regarded as a quantitative correlate for protection from influenza supporting immunogenicity data in ferrets and cynomolgus monkeys for the h10n8 vaccine have also been published by us in  molecular therapy  in 2017 

we have also observed immunogenicity of our mrna h7n9 vaccine in multiple species 

proofofconcept for the use of mrna vaccines encoding the ha protein from h7n9 influenza a virus has been demonstrated in murine studies after vaccination with mrna vaccines mice exhibited antibody production sufficient to achieve ha inhibition titers of   140 additionally a single dose of h7n9 vaccine protected 100 of mice from a lethal challenge with h7n9 virus even 84 days after completion of immunization in a ferret study where h7n9 vaccine was administered intradermally a reduction in lung viral titers was observed when ferrets were challenged 7 days post immunization supporting immunogenicity data in cynomolgus monkeys have also been reported by us in  molecular therapy  in 2017 

h10n8 vaccine mrna1440 and h7n9 vaccine mrna1851 clinical data 

the phase 1 clinical trial for h10n8 in germany has ended and we have generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity 

the phase 1 trial for h10n8 vaccine has met its objectives of describing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1440 vs placebo including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for h10n8 vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity and we have observed 100 of the subjects demonstrating hemagglutinin inhibition or hai titer   140 at day 43 for the 100 µg dose where hai   140 is regarded as a quantitative correlate for protection from influenza we believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding in this randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled doseranging study we evaluated safety and immunogenicity of im dose levels of 25 50 75 100 and 400 µg on a twodose vaccination schedule on day 1 and day 21 we also evaluated intradermal or id dose levels of 25 and 50 µg on a twodose vaccination schedule on day 1 and day 21 the study objectives were safety tolerability and immunogenicity by hai and microneutralization or mn assays 201 subjects were enrolled in this study of which 145 received im vaccination and 56 received id vaccination of the 145 subjects in the im vaccination group there were 30 30 24 23 and 3 subjects in the 25 50 75 100 and 400 µg dose level groups respectively 35 subjects received the placebo the phase 1 trial was conducted with the name of the intervention listed as val506440 in accordance with our legacy naming convention we have since changed our naming convention and have adopted mrna1440 in place of val506440 

doses up to 100 µg administered im demonstrated immunogenicity in the phase 1 trial the 75 µg cohort was started later and we chose not to proceed with its completion because the safety tolerability and immunogenicity data generated supported further development of the 100 µg dose intradermal vaccination was associated with high rates of solicited adverse events or aes mainly injection site reactions and we elected to discontinue enrollment of the id cohorts 

geometric mean titers or gmts in the participants who received a twodose im series of the h10n8 vaccine at doses of 25 50 and 100 µg at day 43 are shown in panel a of the figure below also for those doses 345 552 and 100 of the participants respectively reached hai titers   140 at day 43 as shown in panel b of the figure below

zika vaccine mrna1893 summary 

in collaboration with barda we brought a zika vaccine from mrna sequence design to the clinic in twelve months 

zika is an infectious disease caused by the zika virus in which infection during pregnancy has been linked to severe brain damage in infants with congenital infection and guillainbarré syndrome in adults to date no vaccine to prevent zika infection has been approved in september 2016 we were awarded a contract with barda to be reimbursed up to approximately 125 million for the development of a zika mrna vaccine in order to rapidly respond to a potential epidemic we developed a zika vaccine mrna1325 which went from mrna sequence design to firstinhuman clinical testing in twelve months in addition we also developed a second zika vaccine mrna1893 mrna1893 at 120 of the dose demonstrated better protection in nonhuman primates as compared to mrna1325 we are preparing an ind for submission to the fda for mrna1893 and we will not further develop mrna1325 

zika vaccine mrna1893 disease overview 

we faced a zika epidemic in 2015 for which there were no vaccines or treatments 

the zika virus is a single stranded rna virus of the flaviviridae family it was first isolated in a rhesus macaque in the zika forest uganda in 1947 and the first human case was documented in 1952 seroepidemiology data suggest that it is endemic to regions of africa and asia where the  aedes  mosquito vectors are found zika virus is predominantly spread by mosquitos from the  aedes  genus but it can also be transmitted congenitally sexually and through blood donation 

in 2007 a zika infection outbreak progressed across the pacific islands it arrived in brazil in 2015 and the epidemic spread across the americas this led to the world health organization or who declaring it a public health emergency of international concern in 2016 during the period there were tens of thousands of cases of microcephaly and congenital zika syndrome reported in infants and of resulting neurological sequelae such as guillainbarré syndrome reported in adults 

zika infection is usually asymptomatic or mild in adults leading to fever rash and conjunctivitis however infection of women during pregnancy can result in devastating microcephaly in newborns microcephaly is a birth defect characterized by an abnormally small head and brain associated with lifelong neurodevelopmental delay seizures intellectual disability balance problems and dwarfism  short stature resulting in significant disability and requiring lifelong support to date over a million cases of zika have been officially reported in latin america since most of the cases are asymptomatic we believe the actual number of cases may be far higher international travel means that zika infection has the potential to take on global significance while the number of cases has declined in the past couple of years there is currently no treatment or vaccine available for the zika virus to prevent and respond to potential future epidemics 

currently there is no approved vaccine for zika designing and synthesizing conformationally correct protein antigen vaccines attenuated or vectored live viral vaccines or inactivated vaccines is time consuming and challenging these traditional vaccine approaches have therefore found it difficult to respond fast enough to the emerging zika epidemic 

zika vaccine mrna1893 our product concept 

we advanced a complex antigen to the clinic in twelve months and followed up with a next generation vaccine 

we believe our platform allows for rapid development of mrna vaccines with complex immunogenic antigens faster than traditional vaccines in order to rapidly deploy an mrna vaccine for zika we leveraged available sequences and legacy lnps to develop mrna1325 mrna1325 contains a sequence encoding for structural proteins in the zika virus the intended design is for translation of a polyprotein and processing inside the cell to make a secreted viruslike particle or vlp this process mimics the response of the cell after natural infection as shown in the figure below 

in addition we continued to develop alternative zika mrna vaccine candidates to this end we identified mrna1706 which contains the same mrna sequence as mrna1325 and now formulated in our proprietary lnp continued efforts at identifying different mrna sequences with improved immunogenicity led to mrna1893 a sequence distinct from mrna1325 that increases production of zika vlps and generates enhanced immunogenicity and protection in preclinical animal models compared to mrna1325 mrna1893 is also formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna1706 was discontinued in favor of mrna1893 which has been shown to have more activity and we will not further develop mrna1325 

zika vaccine mrna1893 preclinical information 

we have observed and published our immunogenicity data for our zika vaccine 

the mrna sequences for mrna1325 and mrna1893 have been tested in mice and nonhuman primates or nhps we have published a subset of these data in the journal  cell  in 2017 the mrna sequence for mrna1893 produces equivalent immunogenicity and better protection compared to the sequence used in mrna1325 at 120 of the dose in nhps as shown in the figure below in this study mrna vaccine or placebo was administered intramuscularly in a twodose vaccination schedule 28 days apart with five animals included in each group nhps were challenged with zika virus 28 days postboost and viral titers were measured post challenge via quantitative pcr measurements were quantified in terms of focus forming units each line on the chart represents an individual animal 

sequence for mrna1893 provided comparable protection to that of mrna1325 in nonhuman primate challenge study 

zika vaccine mrna1893 clinical data 

we are preparing an ind for submission to the fda for mrna1893 and we will not further develop mrna1325 

we completed a phase 1 randomized blinded placebocontrolled doseranging study to evaluate the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna1325 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age inclusive in a nonendemic zika region mrna1325 was administered intramuscularly in a twodose vaccination schedule 28 days apart at 3 dose levels 10 µg 25 µg and 100 µg key objectives of the study include 

 subjects were randomly assigned in a blinded fashion in an approximate 41 ratio to receive mrna1325 or placebo at one of three dose levels 10 µg 25 µg or 100 µg with each subject receiving two vaccinations separated by 28 days approximately twothirds of the enrolled subjects at each dose level were flavivirus seronegative and approximately onethird were flavivirus seropositive 

part a of this 2part study includes dosefinding safety and immune testing through 28 days following the second vaccination once subjects completed the final visit in part a they were entered into part b part b was a blinded followup period with assessment of safety through 12 months 

for each dose cohort a sentinel safety group enrolled 3 flavivirus seronegative subjects randomized to mrna1325 and followed for 7 days after first vaccination an internal safety team or ist reviewed blinded safety data during part a through 7 days following first vaccination of the sentinel safety leadin for each dose cohort and approved randomization of the remainder of that dose cohort the safety monitoring committee or smc approved the escalation to the next higher dose cohort after review of blinded safety data of the currently dosed cohort through seven days following the second vaccination and cumulative safety data of all cohorts the trial design is shown in the figure below 

the mrna1325 trial has completed enrollment 72 received mrna1325 18 received placebo mrna1325 did not show sufficient immunogenicity at doses up to 100 µg although the phase 1 safety and tolerability data generated would permit additional dose escalation of mrna1325 our current development efforts are focused on our nextgeneration vaccine mrna1893 which has been shown to be 20 times more potent in nhp zika challenge studies we are preparing an ind for submission to the fda for mrna1893 and we will not further develop mrna1325 

chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 summary 

our chikungunya vaccine has generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity for the phase 1 clinical study through approximately six months post dosing we aim to address a public health need with this vaccine 

chikungunya virus represents a serious public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions with over 3 million cases globally while it is rarely fatal it can cause longlasting and debilitating pain in multiple joints from polyarthralgia as well as serious neurological conditions to date no vaccine to prevent chikungunya infection has been approved effective mosquito control has proven challenging even in higher income countries we believe our platform is wellsuited to address this disease as we can produce and deliver mrna encoding the entire chikungunya virus structural polyprotein capsid and envelope proteins to cells which in turn produce and secrete chikungunya viruslike particles or chikungunya vlps known to be robust inducers of protective neutralizing antibody responses this program is supported by darpa for a phase 1 trial which is being conducted in the united states the phase 1 trial for chikungunya vaccine in the united states is fully enrolled and has met its objectives of describing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1388 versus placebo through approximately six months post dosing including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for chikungunya vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity for the first part of the trial and we have observed 100 seroresponse for subjects at the 100 µg dose level 28 days post the second dose we have also observed a durable response for the 100 µg dose with 13 of 14 subjects at day 196 with neutralizing antibody titers above the seroresponse threshold the second part of the trial to measure persistence of response at one year post dosing is ongoing we believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding 

chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 disease overview 

we aim to address a significant public health need 

chikungunya is a mosquitoborne rna alphavirus posing a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions while chikungunya has been present in africa for centuries recent outbreaks and epidemics in new regions have arisen due to the expanding distribution of the  aedes  mosquito a chikungunya epidemic began in 2004 in kenya spread to india and was exported to nearly all regions of the world and brought chikungunya to the attention of the western world as of april 2016 chikungunya cases had been reported in over 100 countries and territories around the world including more than 45 countries and territories throughout the americas chikungunya virus infection causes disease characterized by an acute onset of fever rash myalgia and sometimes debilitating polyarthralgia giving the virus its name which means “that which bends up” when translated from makonde it is rarely fatal but neurological sequelae such as guillainbarre syndrome and chronic arthralgia have been associated with infection 

chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of the togaviridae family with a positivestrand rna genome the viral structural proteins are naturally expressed as a single polyprotein followed by subsequent cleavage by viral and cellular proteases into capsid c and envelope e glycoproteins e3 e2 6k and e1 the e proteins are major targets of protective neutralizing antibody responses 

there are currently no approved vaccines to treat or prevent chikungunya infection or disease and effective mosquito control has proven challenging even in higher income countries currently infected individuals are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to relieve symptoms therefore there is a need for a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine 

chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 our product concept 

we are developing a complex polyprotein encoding mrna encapsulated in a lipid nanoparticle 

the mrna1388 vaccine consists of a single mrna encoding the full native structural polyprotein ce3e26ke1 that is naturally processed into c and e proteins which assemble into vlps and are released from cells 

the e proteins on these vlps are the major target of neutralizing and protective antibodies that in the context of natural infection can provide essentially lifelong immunity to reinfection the c protein provides structure to the vlp and contains t cell epitopes that could contribute to protective immune responses the mrna is encapsulated in a legacy lnp an illustration of our approach is shown in the figure below 

chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 preclinical information 

we have conducted preclinical studies in mice and nonhuman primates 

preclinical immunogenicity studies have been performed in mice and nonhuman primates and suggest that our chikungunya vaccine induces a robust neutralizing antibody response in a dose and regimendependent manner further a one or twodose vaccination series protected ag129 mice from a lethal chikungunya virus challenge administered 56 days and 112 days later demonstrating durable immunity as shown in the figure below in this study ag129 mice were immunized with 04 2 or 10 µg of the mrna chikungunya vaccine in a legacy lnp administered intramuscularly on day 0 d0 or days 0 and 28 d0 and d28 serum neutralizing antibody titers were measured in five mice per group on day 56 by 50 plaque reduction neutralization test prnt50 followed immediately by a lethal chikungunya virus challenge panels a and c neutralizing antibody titers were measured in another five mice per group on day 112 followed by a lethal challenge panels b and d

chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 clinical data 

the phase 1 trial for mrna1388 in the united states is fully enrolled has generated safety and tolerability data and demonstrated immunogenicity through approximately six months post dosing 

the phase 1 trial for chikungunya vaccine in the united states is fully enrolled and met its objectives of describing the safety and tolerability profile of mrna1388 versus placebo through approximately six months post dosing including capturing solicited and unsolicited local and systemic adverse events the phase 1 trial for chikungunya vaccine has also demonstrated immunogenicity for the first part of the trial and we have observed 100 seroresponse for subjects at the 100 µg dose level 28 days post the second dose we have observed a durable response for the 100 µg dose with 13 of 14 subjects at day 196 with neutralizing antibody titers above the seroresponse threshold the second part of the trial to measure persistence of response at one year post dosing is ongoing we believe the data provides support to advance the program in clinical development if we choose to with additional government or other funding 

the mrna1388 phase 1 study is a randomized placebocontrolled doseranging study to evaluate the safety immunogenicity and tolerability of mrna1388 in healthy adults 18 to 49 years of age inclusive in a nonendemic region in the united states the study includes three dose level cohorts 25 50 and 100 µg each containing 20 subjects randomized 31 active placebo all subjects are given a twodose intramuscular injection series spaced four weeks apart day 0 and 28 the phase 1 trial was conducted with the investigational medicine named val181388 in accordance with our legacy naming convention we have since changed our naming convention and have adopted mrna1388 in place of val181388 the key objectives of the study include 

 the schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below each dose cohort starts with a sentinel safety group and based on review of the internal safety team or ist advances to an expansion of that dose cohort advancement to the next dose level is permitted after safety monitoring committee or smc review

ii program descriptions in our cancer vaccines modality 

we designed our cancer vaccines modality to treat or cure cancer by enhancing immune responses to tumor neoantigens defined below this modality has two programs currently for neoantigen vaccines a personalized cancer vaccine or pcv program and a vaccine against neoantigens related to a common oncogene called kras both conducted in collaboration with merck the goal of a cancer vaccine is to safely expose the patient’s immune system to tumor related antigens known as neoantigens to enable the immune system to elicit a more effective antitumor response our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular tumor in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique to a patient as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program

opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 despite the recent success of checkpoint inhibitors the majority of patients with the most common types of epithelial cancer still do not benefit from checkpoint inhibitors as many patients still have incomplete or no response to currently available therapies in addition treatment resistance is thought to arise from a number of mechanisms principally the local immunosuppressive effects of cancer cells which prevent either access to or recognition by t cells 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy such as checkpoint inhibitors and chimeric antigen receptor t cell therapies have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens 

our approach 

we are developing mrnabased cancer vaccines to utilize the antitumor killing capacity of t cells to drive antitumor efficacy evidence of tumor killing by t cells in treating certain cancers has increased in the last decade with advances in immunotherapies the immune system’s antitumor response relies on t cells recognizing tumor cells as nonself and eradicating these “foreign” cells human leukocyte antigen or hla complexes are a diverse set of genes or alleles that present fragments of proteins from inside hla i or outside hla ii cells to the immune system a person’s hla type defines what hla alleles they express and can restrict what antigen may be presented to their immune system antigens presented in hla molecules are recognized by t cell receptors or tcrs present on the cell surface of cd4 and cd8 t cells these two main classes of t cells have distinct mechanisms to potentially attack tumor cells cd4 cells play an important role in activating other immune cells after recognition of antigens in hla ii molecules whereas cd8 cells can have direct cytotoxic cell killing capabilities upon recognition of antigens in hla i molecules both cell types have been demonstrated to have important roles in driving an effective antitumor immune response 

over the past three decades there have been many attempts to develop cancer vaccines few of which have been successful key reasons include 1 past attempts were directed against shared “self” nonmutated antigens 2 nearly all previous attempts utilize peptide fragments to try to mimic peptides displayed by hla i molecules this method may not have been able to mimic the natural processing and presentation of antigens by the immune system and therefore may not be recognized and 3 earlier work was done in the era prior to the benefit of checkpoint inhibitors 

we believe one approach to improve the efficacy of checkpoint inhibitors is to develop vaccines that increase both the number and antitumor activity of a patient’s t cells that recognize tumor neoantigens our cancer vaccines modality is focused on the use of mrna to express neoantigens found in a particular cancer in order to elicit an immune response via t cells that recognize those neoantigens and therefore the tumor these neoantigens can either be unique as in the case of our personalized cancer vaccine program or can be related to a driver oncogene found across subsets of patients as in the case of our kras vaccine program 

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 summary 

we are collaborating with merck to use the strength of our platform to develop cancer vaccines with multiple neoantigens unique to each patient also known as personalized cancer vaccines or pcvs 

recent breakthroughs in cancer immunotherapy have demonstrated that powerful antitumor responses can be achieved by activating antigen specific t cells in a variety of cancer settings despite these advances many patients still have incomplete or no response to anticancer therapies one approach is to administer a cancer vaccine that encodes for peptides containing mutations found in their cancer ie to create a personalized cancer vaccine composed of neoantigens unique to a patient’s tumor previous attempts have demonstrated the ability of mrna and peptidebased platforms to drive immune responses toward patientspecific neoantigens preclinical studies have shown that the combination of cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors provides improved benefit over singleagent therapies our platform is positioned for bringing personalized cancer vaccines to patients with our proprietary  in silico  design of each patient’s neoantigenbased mrna vaccine to be coupled with our automated cellfree manufacturing processes and infrastructure based in norwood ma as well as our digital infrastructure we believe these attributes coupled with our proprietary lnps help differentiate our approach from ongoing efforts at developing mrnabased cancer vaccines mrna4157 is administered either as monotherapy or in combination with pembrolizumab marketed in the united states as keytruda this is in collaboration with merck as governed by a joint steering committee nci4650 is a personalized cancer vaccine being tested by the national cancer institute or nci as a monotherapy for patients with advanced metastatic cancers nci4650 differs from mrna4157 in its neoantigen selection process both mrna4157 and nci4650 are in phase 1 trials in the united states as of february 15 2019 13 patients have been dosed in part a of the trial mrna4157 monotherapy and 20 patients have been dosed in part b of the study mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab in our dose escalation of mrna4157 in part a monotherapy we have detected antigen specific t cell responses   we and our strategic collaborator merck have submitted the protocol to the fda for a randomized phase 2 trial of mrna4157 in resected melanoma at high risk of recurrence 

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 our product concept 

rapid personalized current good manufacturing practice or cgmp manufacturing to bring personalized cancer vaccines to patients 

as tumors grow they acquire mutations some of which create new protein sequences or neoantigens that can be presented on hla molecules in the tumor and recognized as nonself by t cells these neoantigens can be shared as in mrna5671 or are completely unique to an individual patient’s tumor in addition to the neoantigens being unique and patient specific the presentation of those neoantigens is also dependent on a patient’s specific hla type identification of patientspecific hla type and tumor neoantigens through next generation sequencing paired with our proprietary  in silico  design of each patient’s mrna vaccine and rapid manufacturing for a specific patient allows us to rapidly deliver a completely unique and personalized medicine to patients 

we believe that antigenencoded mrna is an attractive technology platform for neoantigen vaccination for cancer patients for the following reasons 



our personalized cancer vaccine program mrna4157 consists of an mrna that encodes up to 34 neoantigens predicted to elicit both class i cd8 and class ii cd4 responses designed against each individual patient’s tumor mutations and specific to their hla type nci4650 includes both neoantigens known to be immunogenic as identified through  ex vivo  experimentation on the patient’s immune cells and neoantigens predicted by the nci bioinformatics algorithm for both mrna4157 and nci4650 the neoantigens are encoded in a single mrna sequence and therefore termed a neoantigen concatemer each patientspecific mrna4157 and nci4650 is formulated in our proprietary lnps designed for intramuscular injection an illustration of the intended design of mrna4157 and nci4650 is shown in the figure below 

each mrna4157 and nci4650 is produced using an integrated batch manufacturing process that is the same regardless of the sequence of the neoantigens to be produced the overall process involves five major steps that are highly integrated and intended to enable a robust chain of custody and chain of identity an overview of the system is provided in the figure below 

the process includes the following steps 



specifically for each patient the tumor sample and peripheral blood samples are collected and immediately sent for ngs analysis whole exome sequencing or wes data are generated from both the tumor and blood samples with the blood sample serving as the germline unmutated reference wes results from the blood sample are also to be used to determine the patient’s hlatype using an ngsbased approach the tumor transcriptome is determined by mrna sequencing or rnaseq the hla typing wes and rnaseq results for each patient are provided as inputs to our proprietary vaccine design algorithm which predicts which neoantigens could be the most immunogenic the mrna sequence is then manufactured using an automated workflow to enable a rapid turnaround time the final drug product is shipped to the clinical site for administration to the same patient that provided the original biopsy 

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 preclinical information 

we have utilized model antigens as surrogates for pcv to demonstrate the ability to elicit a robust t cell response with a single mrna 

we have completed preclinical studies to characterize the ability of an mrna vaccine to induce a robust and specific t cell response to multiple antigens specifically the ability of our mrna vaccines to elicit

pcv mrna4157 and nci4650 clinical data 

our phase 1 trial for pcv is currently ongoing in the united states 

the phase 1 trial is an openlabel multicenter study to assess the safety tolerability and immunogenicity of mrna4157 alone in subjects with resected solid tumors and in combination with the cpi pembrolizumab marketed in the united states as keytruda in subjects with inoperable solid tumors the study is sponsored by us mrna4157 is administered by intramuscular injection on the first day of each 21day cycle and for a maximum of 9 doses mrna4157 is administered as monotherapy part a or in combination with pembrolizumab parts b c and d in the united states four mrna4157 dose levels of 004 mg 013 mg 039 mg and 1 mg will be explored in part a and part b through dose escalation the following cancers are being investigated nonsmall cell lung cancer subject to certain entry criteria small cell lung cancer melanoma bladder urothelial carcinoma human papillomavirusnegative head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and a variety of solid malignancies 

the key objectives of the study include 

 a schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below 

as of february 15 2019 33 patients have been dosed with mrna4157 thirteen of the 33 patients have been treated with mrna4157 monotherapy in part a and 20 patients have been treated with mrna4157 and pembrolizumab in part b in part a patients have been dosed up to the 1 mg dose level which is currently ongoing in part b patients have been dosed up to the 1 mg dose 

level which is currently ongoing there have been no doselimiting toxicities or significant related toxicities observed in these patients to date parts c and d of the study are currently recruiting 

in our dose escalation of mrna4157 in part a monotherapy we have detected antigen specific t cell responses this is measured by restimulating unexpanded peripheral blood mononuclear cells with sets of peptides corresponding to neoantigens encoded by the patientspecific mrna4157 and is shown in the figure below individual data points indicate technical replicates 

antigenspecific t cell responses for one patient at the 013 mg dose level in part a of the phase 1 clinical trial for pcv vaccine mrna4157 

we and our strategic collaborator merck have submitted a new protocol to the fda to commence a randomized phase 2 study to assess whether postoperative adjuvant therapy with mrna4157 in combination with pembrolizumab improves relapsefree survival compared to pembrolizumab alone the study has a primary endpoint of relapse free survival with a primary analysis at 12 months and will be conducted with patients that have had complete resection of cutaneous melanoma but remain at high risk of recurrence 

a schematic of the phase 2 trial is shown in the figure below 

nci4650 is in an ongoing investigatorinitiated singlearm openlabel trial involving up to 12patients with advanced metastatic disease sponsored by national cancer institute 

kras vaccine mrna5671 summary 

in collaboration with merck we are developing a cancer vaccine mrna5671 with mrnas encoding for a concatemer of mutations in the kras oncogene protein 

although monotherapy checkpoint inhibitor treatment can provide significant benefit for some cancer patients many have incomplete or no response to therapy presenting a need for alternative therapies to stimulate antitumor immunological responses finding oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell epitopes has considerable therapeutic implications point mutations in the kras gene occur in about 22 of human cancers such as colorectal nonsmall cell lung and pancreatic cancers direct inhibition of kras has proven challenging and to date there are no successful krastargeted cancer therapies it has been reported that krasmutant neoantigens can be presented on certain human hlas therefore one approach is to immunize the body to naturally synthesize neoantigen peptides that contain common kras mutations for presentation to the immune system by mrna we have designed an mrna to generate and present kras neoantigens to the immune system from the four most common kras  mutations we are advancing this program through clinical trials in collaboration with merck and we have transferred the ind to merck since merck is the sponsor of the phase 1 trial patients will either be dosed with mrna5671 as monotherapy or in combination with the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab 

kras vaccine mrna5671 our product concept 

our approach is to encode multiple mutations of kras in our mrna vaccine administered together with a checkpoint inhibitor 

oncogenic driver mutations that encode targetable t cell neoantigens have considerable potential therapeutic implications 1 driver mutations are subject to positive selection as they confer survival advantages for the tumor and 2 such neoantigens could be shared between patients enabling an easier approach to developing and manufacturing such therapeutic or curative interventions 

kras is a frequently mutated oncogene in epithelial cancers primarily lung colorectal cancer or crc and pancreatic cancers the four most prevalent kras mutations associated with these malignancies are g12d g12v g13d and g12c which constitute 80 to 90 of kras mutations kras has multiple downstream signaling pathways and although drugs have been developed to target individual effectors direct inhibition of kras could be more efficacious direct inhibition of kras has proven challenging as have past efforts at generating a cancer vaccine against kras these attempts have proven to be ineffective likely due to either the lack of concomitant administration of a checkpoint inhibitor or vaccines which have been only minimally immunogenic none of the historic attempts at a kras vaccine used mrna 

immune stimulators are often incorporated in vaccines to improve immune response to the antigens of interest stimulator of interferon gene or sting is a cytosolic nucleotide sensor known to trigger type 1 interferon responses and has been reported to promote antigen specific t cell responses sting has been reported to promote antitumor immunity and vaccines including sting agonists eg cyclic dinucleotides show overall improvement of immune responses to poorly immunogenic antigens merck has opted to advance mrna5671 without sting mrna and may choose to include sting mrna in further clinical development of this vaccine 

in order to drive t cell mediated antitumor responses our mrna vaccine includes an mrna encoding for a concatemer of sequences encoding the four most common kras mutations encapsulated in our proprietary lnp our mrna vaccine will be dosed either as monotherapy or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor an illustration of one approach for mrna5671 is shown in the figure below 

kras vaccine mrna5671 preclinical information 

we have observed the utility of kras mrna vaccine in vivo 

the immunogenicity of our kras vaccine is supported by several preclinical studies in which we observed that our mrna encoding for kras mutations can be made in cells and presented in transgenic mice with specific hla i alleles 

one of these models was a transgenic mouse model expressing a specific human hla this is shown in the figure below these transgenic mice were vaccinated with either mrna encoding a11positive control antigens control single mutant kras neoantigen or the concatemer of the four most common mutant kras neoantigens plus mrna encoding sting mrna was formulated in our proprietary lnp and delivered intramuscularly on day 1 and day 15 t cell responses were measured on day 22 by restimulating splenocytes with either medium or wild type or mutant kras peptides panel a—kras mutation 1 and panel b – kras mutation 2 robust and specific antigen specific cd8ifn γ t cell responses were detected in splenocytes after restimulation with kras mutation 1 peptide and kras mutation 2 peptide

the next step is to conduct an openlabel multicenter doseescalation and dose expansion phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of mrna5671 administered as an intramuscular injection both as a monotherapy and in combination with pembrolizumab merck may choose to measure t cell responses in this trial the ind was originally filed by us and then transferred to merck and remains open 

iii program descriptions in our intratumoral immunooncology modality 

we designed our intratumoral immunooncology modality to treat or cure cancer by transforming the tumor microenvironment to drive anticancer t cell responses against tumors this modality currently has three programs our mrna technology within this modality allows for the combination of multiple therapeutics that can be directly injected into a tumor with the goal of activating the tumor microenvironment to kill cancer cells in the injected tumor as well as in distal tumors known as the abscopal effect intratumoral administration allows for localized effect of these therapeutics that could be toxic if administered systemically 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

opportunity 

more than 16 million new cancer cases and approximately 600000 deaths due to cancer were predicted in the united states for 2017 there have been several advances in the treatment of cancer through immunemediated therapies in recent years however the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer remains poor especially in tumors that have little immune system engagement and are therefore termed immunologically “cold” we aim to activate the tumor microenvironment with our mrna therapeutics in conjunction with a checkpoint inhibitor to activate the immune system against these otherwise immunologically cold tumors 

our approach 

our intratumoral immunooncology modality is focused on driving robust specific anticancer t cell responses transforming cold tumors with an immunosuppressive microenvironment into one that is immunologically “hot” thereby resulting in a productive anticancer immune response our goal is to discover and develop locally administered or intratumoral immunemediated therapies to deliver mrna encoding for potent immunestimulatory proteins that can act at the site of the injected tumor reduce systemic toxicities and potentially create an “abscopal effect” where distal tumor sites are also impacted these may be combined with checkpoint inhibitors to boost the response all of the mrnas utilized in this modality are designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of microrna binding sites thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability 

earlier efforts by others on the utility of intratumoral immunemediated therapies have been established in murine models of cancer in many of our preclinical studies focusing on demonstrating bioactivity and efficacy in mice we have employed surrogate mrnas encoding murine homologs given that human proteins may not be sufficiently crossreactive in mice and that the use of human proteins in mice would be expected to elicit antiforeign protein immune responses 

ox40l mrna2416 summary 

our immunooncology approach to enhance specific t cell responses in the tumor microenvironment via expression of the membrane t cell costimulator ox40l by intratumoral injection of ox40l mrna 

there have been several recent advances in the treatment of cancer through activation of the immune system however many patients with advanced stages of cancer respond to few therapies and continue to face a poor outlook alternative strategies to activate an immunologic antitumor response while at the same time reducing systemic toxicities are required to this end we have developed an investigational mrna therapeutic coding for wildtype ox40 ligand or ox40l protein a membrane protein normally expressed on antigen presenting cells upon immune stimulation that augments an activated immune response mrna2416 encodes for wildtype ox40l which is a membrane protein a class of proteins that we believe cannot be manufactured for administration to tumor cells by recombinant technologies mrna2416 is being developed for the treatment of solid tumors following local intratumoral injection we are currently sponsoring a phase 12 trial that is ongoing in the united states as of october 22 2018 26 patients were dosed with mrna2416 of which three patients were unclassified since they were early on in the study prior to the planned first evaluation after starting treatment six patients were noted to have a best overall response of stable disease 16 patients clinically progressed prior to the planned first evaluation after starting treatment and one patient progressed based on the planned first evaluation after starting treatment as of october 22 2018 two patients with ovarian cancer have demonstrated clinical observations of regression in certain injected lesions and in an adjacent uninjected lesion these clinical observations from these two ovarian cancer patients do not meet partial response criteria as per the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors or recist guidelines version 11 based on these clinical observations we have opted to expand the trial to a phase 2 expansion cohort in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma 

ox40l mrna2416 mechanistic overview 

ox40l is a t cell costimulator 

the generation of optimal t cell responses requires t cell receptor or tcr engagement by presented epitopes eg cancer antigens and a positive secondary signal achieved through costimulatory molecules like ox40 ox40 receptor also known as tnfrsf4 or 

cd134 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor or tnf receptor superfamily and is upregulated on activated immune effector cells upon tcr activation ox40 is endogenously stimulated via ox40l a homotrimeric membrane protein normally expressed on professional antigen presenting cells binding of ox40 by ox40l in the presence of a recognized antigen enhances the expansion of cd4 and cd8 t cells increases t cell effector function and enhances survival of experienced t cells for increased memory capacity prior clinical attempts of activating ox40 with agonist antibodies may have been hampered via antibody interactions with other cells we believe that introduction of ox40l in tumor sites via mrna may serve to boost t cell responses and we believe intratumoral administration of mrna encoding for ox40l may be an attractive method of enhancing anticancer immunity 

ox40l mrna2416 our product concept 

our approach is to deliver ox40l mrna in a lipid nanoparticle intratumorally to produce a membrane t cell costimulator 

our product consists of mrna coding for the human sequence of ox40l formulated in our proprietary lnp mrna2416 was designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of a microrna binding site thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability following intratumoral injection a specific antitumor immune response is expected to be induced via proliferation and migration of t cell clones with specificity for the cancer that may also result in systemic antitumor responses an illustration of our approach for this program is shown in the figure below an earlier concept of this development candidate included a legacy lnp however we observed sufficient toxicity findings in an indenabling glp toxicology study to abandon the legacy lnp toxicity findings were largely diminished when the development candidate was switched from a legacy lnp to our proprietary lnp 

ox40l mrna2416 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of cancer using our approach 

intratumoral administration of mouse ox40l mrna in our proprietary lnp resulted in production of ox40l protein in the tumor microenvironment and draining lymph node in mice the activity of mouse ox40l or mox40l was evaluated in syngeneic models including an h22 hepatocellular carcinoma model with this model h22 cancer cells were subcutaneously implanted on the flank of balbc mice following tumor growth mice were randomized into treatment groups and treated with weekly intratumoral injections of formulated mrna encoding mox40l or a negative control mrna repeated weekly intratumoral injections of mox40l mrna in a syngeneic h22 mouse model resulted in 50 of the mrnatreated mice with no measurable disease at the end of the study survival of mice treated with negative control mrna and mrna encoding murine ox40l are depicted in gray and red respectively in the figure below mice with subcutaneous h22 tumors were treated intratumorally with 75 µg of mrna formulated in lnps on days 8 16 and 24 post cancer cell implant 6 of 12 mice treated with mox40l mrna were complete responders with no detectable tumor burden at day 100 whereas negative control mrna formulated in lnps yielded no complete responders survival curves were plotted by considering any reason a mouse was removed from study including the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3   as a survival event 

we further demonstrated generation of anticancer immunological memory after ox40l mrna treatment as no tumor growth was observed in mice in the six initial complete responders that were reinjected with the same h22 cancer cells as shown below 

50 complete responders n12 with mouse ox40l mrna in h22 syngeneic mouse model study 

ox40l mrna2416 clinical data 

our interim data indicate that intratumoral treatment with ox40l mrna has no dose limiting toxicities and has led to clinical observations of tumor regression in two patients with ovarian cancer but the tumor regression at the doses studied do not meet recist criteria for partial responses in the phase 12 trial in the united states 

the phase 12 trial for mrna2416 is an openlabel multicenter study of repeated intratumoral injections of mrna2416 in patients with advanced relapsedrefractory solid tumor malignancies and lymphomas in the united states mrna2416 will be administered at day 1 and day 15 of a 28day cycle with a maximum of 6 cycles the dose levels being tested are 1 mg 2 mg 4 mg and 8 mg the objectives of this study include evaluating safety and tolerability of mrna2416 administered intratumorally and to define the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for expansion other endpoints include pharmacokinetic analyses as well as assessment of biomarkers of immunological response in tumor 

the study includes 2 dosing periods dose escalation period followed by an expansion period at the recommended dose for expansion patients are enrolled into one of the following three biopsy cohorts 

 a schematic of the trial design is shown in the figure below 

as of november 15 2018 28 patients have been dosed with mrna2416 a subset of biopsies of treated lesions from those patients detected higher ox40l protein levels after mrna2416 administration in approximately 18 of patients we have observed rapid onset of multiple grade 2 and a single grade 3 transient reversible injection related reactions all of which were resolved with antihistamines corticosteroids or supplemental oxygen three suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or susars have been reported of the three one was the grade 3 serious adverse event or sae described above a second case was reported for a grade 2 

noninfectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome and the patient was kept overnight at the hospital in the third case a patient diagnosed with stage iiic ovarian carcinoma experienced a skin ulceration during treatment deemed to be a nonserious adverse event located within the injected tumor which had begun to regress following treatment with mrna2416 after the last administered dose of mrna2416 and after the patient withdrew from the trial for personal reasons the wound was smaller in size subsequently the patient underwent additional treatment for disease progression with cytoxanavastin the wound increased significantly in size and avastin was discontinued due to patient preference and wound healing concerns the patient was then hospitalized due to worsening of the skin ulceration by which time the injected tumor was noted to be absent though other lesions were present although no longer in the study this hospitalization was deemed by the investigator as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction related to study drug but deemed by us as possibly related to study drug after discharge from the hospital the patient died this death was reported to be due to disease progression not study drug after the intratumoral injection of mrna2416 in other patients no other skin ulceration has been observed related to study drug 

as of february 15 2019 we have dosed five additional patients for a total of 33 patients dosed with mrna2416 and we have not seen any dose limiting toxicities the study is currently in its doseconfirmation phase at doses up to 8mg 

we have collected and analyzed eight paired biopsies of tumors pre and postinjection of mrna2416 through october 22 2018 of these eight six paired biopsies are from injected lesions and two are from uninjected lesions in three of the six paired biopsies from injected lesions where tumors showed evidence of the location of the injection site and had viable tissue from the biopsy to analyze we have observed an increase in ox40l protein after mrna administration in one of these cases we have observed ox40l protein expression in the injected lesion for a biopsy collected at cycle 1 day 2 as shown by quantitative immunofluorescence staining in the figure below staining in red denotes ox40l protein and 4’6diamidino2phenylindole or dapi stains dna to indicate nuclei in blue cytokeratin staining in green indicates keratin filaments often used to mark epithelial cancer cells 

ox40l protein production in tumor cells of a patient with ovarian cancer dosed with mrna2416 



in the remaining three of the six paired biopsies from injected lesions we did not observe ox40l protein increase possibly because there was no noted evidence of injection site or there was extensive tissue necrosis 

of the 26 patients dosed with mrna2416 as of october 22 2018 there are two patients with ovarian cancer these two patients with ovarian cancer have clinical observations of regression in certain injected lesions and in an adjacent uninjected lesion these clinical observations do not meet partial response criteria as per recist guidelines version 11 one of these patients in group 2a has received eight doses of 2 mg and was still on treatment as of october 22 2018 in this patient a reduction in an injected lesion was observed after the fourth dose in addition for the same patient a reduction in an adjacent uninjected lesion was observed we did not observe an increase in ox40l protein production in this uninjected lesion in the posttreatment biopsy at cycle 1 day 27 

the phase 12 trial for ox40l mrna2416 is ongoing we have filed a protocol amendment to the fda for a phase 2 expansion cohort in patients with advanced ovarian carcinoma as part of the current trial

despite recent advances in immunemediated therapies for cancer the outlook for many patients with advanced cancer is poor we are developing triplet mrna2752 and other programs to drive anticancer t cell responses by transforming cold tumor microenvironments into productive “hotter” immune landscapes with local intratumoral therapies triplet mrna2752 utilizes the intrinsic advantage of mrna to multiplex and to produce membrane and secreted proteins with mrna in a single investigational medicine triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding human ox40l interleukin 23 or il23 and interleukin 36 gamma or il36γ  that are encapsulated in our proprietary lnp and administered intratumorally ox40l is a membrane protein whereas il23 and il36γ are secreted cytokines we believe our approach has the advantage of localized high concentration gradients of il23 and il36γ compared to recombinant proteins administered systemically or intratumorally additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which we believe recombinant protein technologies cannot enable the combination of ox40l il23 and il36γ has shown robust activity in preclinical cancer models and is synergistic with checkpoint inhibitors in addition this combination elicits an antitumor response on distal tumors via the “abscopal effect” as well as treated tumors in preclinical studies we have initiated dosing in a phase 1 study of triplet mrna2752 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 mechanistic overview 

triplet mrna2752 is designed and tailored to activate the immune system in two ways 

this potential mrna medicine is a novel mrnabased therapeutic agent containing multiple mrnas that code for the wild type human ox40l il23 and il36γ proteins that have distinct functions yet work synergistically in mediating anticancer responses triplet mrna2752 brings two approaches into a single multimechanism therapy 

 the generation of optimal t cell responses requires t cell receptor or tcr engagement by presented epitopes eg cancer antigens and a positive secondary signal achieved through costimulatory molecules like ox40 ox40 receptor also known as tnfrsf4 and cd134 is a member of the tumor necrosis factor or tnf receptor superfamily and is upregulated on activated immune effector cells upon tcr activation ox40 is endogenously stimulated via ox40l a homotrimeric membrane protein normally expressed on professional antigen presenting cells binding of ox40 by ox40l in the presence of a recognized antigen enhances the expansion of cd4 and cd8 t cells increases t cell effector function and enhances survival of experienced t cells for increased memory capacity therefore introduction of ox40l via mrna may serve to boost t cell responses we believe that in addition to boosting t cell responses via ox40l expression the expression of proinflammatory cytokines within a treated tumor may serve to ignite and transform an immunologically cold tumor microenvironment into a productive anticancer immune response the initial focus was on cytokines with wellestablished roles in initiating inflammation and bridging innate to adaptive immunity in humans namely the il1 and il12 families respectively specifically anticancer effects have been observed by introduction of il1 family member il36γ in preclinical mouse models of cancer il12 family members including il23 are often referred to as central coordinators of immune responses largely due to their capacity to bridge innate to adaptive immunity 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 our product concept 

the potential advantage of mrna to target multiple immunostimulatory pathways in tumors 

we are developing triplet mrna2752 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumor malignancies or lymphoma as a single agent or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors triplet mrna2752 includes three mrnas encoding ox40l il23 and il36γ encapsulated in our proprietary lnp triplet mrna2752 is designed to make these proteins in cells of the local tumor environment or lymph node our approach potentially has the advantage of localized gradients of two important cytokines il23 and il36γ rather than a systemic administration or intratumoral injection of cytokine proteins that would lead to quick diffusion away from the tumor additionally the mrna for ox40l encodes for the wild type membrane protein which would be challenging to administer to either a tumor or systemically as a recombinant membrane protein capable of costimulation of t cells mrna for il23 produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il23a subunits with a linker between the subunits mrna for il36γ produces a protein with introduced signal peptide to bypass a need for upstream processing for release and activity in addition all three mrna were designed to decrease the amount of protein that could be made in hepatocytes through incorporation of microrna binding sites thus potentially reducing offtarget effects and resulting in better tolerability an illustration of our approach for triplet mrna2752 is shown in the figure below 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 preclinical information 

the ox40lil23il36γ combination promotes tumor killing in mice of injected and noninjected tumors along with a lasting t cell effect 

as described earlier preclinical work was conducted using mouse homologs the combination local therapy of ox40lil23il36γ mrnas achieved 70100 complete response rates in two mc38 syngeneic mouse models of cancer one that is normally relatively responsive and the other completely refractory to systemic checkpoint inhibitor treatment the triple combination therapy had better results than individual and doublet mrna combinations in one study mice carrying bilateral mc38s tumors received 5 µg total mrna injected into the right flank tumor only 25 µg each mrna administered for doublets and 167 µg each for triplet combinations the survival plots are graphed in the figure below survival events were triggered when animals surpassed the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3  for both tumors combined animals removed from study for other reasons were censored and indicated below as horizontal lines prior to day 100 20 mice were included in each cohort depicted and there were 10 11 and 20 complete responders ie no measurable disease at either tumor site for the il23il36γ il23ox40l and ox40lil23il36γ treatment groups respectively at 100 days post cancer cell implant we also found that a single dose of ox40lil23il36γ mrna was able to induce complete disease control at both treated and distal sites sometimes known as an abscopal effect this underscores the potential of our approach to lead to a well tolerated and broadly active therapy for treatment of multilesional and metastatic cancers 

100 n20 complete responders with mouse ox40lil23il36γ mrna in mc38 dual flank syngeneic mouse model study 

in addition to ox40lil23il36γ mrna monotherapy activity we have further observed that a single suboptimal dose of ox40lil23il36γ mrna therapy was synergistically active with systemically administered antipd1pdl1 as well as antictla4 antibodies again demonstrating complete response rates of   70 

ox40lil23il36γ triplet mrna2752 clinical plan 

the phase 1 trial for triplet mrna2752 has initiated in the united states 

we have initiated a phase 1 study that is designed as an openlabel multicenter study of intratumoral injections of triplet mrna2752 alone or in combination with checkpoint inhibitors the objectives of this study include 

 a schematic of the clinical trial design is shown in the figure below there are three treatment arms

il12 medi1191 summary 

our immunooncology approach to transform the tumor microenvironment il12 as a localized secreted protein in collaboration with astrazeneca 

another strategy for cancer patients with immunologically cold tumors is to transform the tumor microenvironment by introducing proinflammatory cytokines directly into tumors or draining lymph nodes in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing medi1191 that is an mrna for il12 encapsulated in our proprietary lnp to be delivered intratumorally systemic administration of recombinant il12 protein was poorly tolerated in early clinical trials and exhibited generally low response rates medi1191 can enhance the immune response by positively impacting both antigen presenting cells and t cells and local intratumoral expression of il12 can potentially improve tolerability compared to systemic protein treatments astrazeneca is planning a phase 1 clinical trial for medi1191 which is to be coadministered with a checkpoint inhibitor 

il12 medi1191 mechanistic overview 

il12 is a powerful immunemodulator that bridges innate and adaptive responses 

the il12 family members are often referred to as central controllers of immune responses due to their capacity to bridge from innate to adaptive immunity il12 is a potent immunemodulator typically associated with a type 1 immune response and production of interferongamma   while preclinical studies using il12 have resulted in dramatic antitumor effects in syngeneic cancer models clinical development of systemically administered recombinant il12 has been hampered by systemic toxicity 

il12 medi1191 our product concept 

in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing intratumoral delivery of il12 in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor 

intratumoral delivery of il12 has been observed to be a feasible approach to overcome the toxicity associated with systemic il12 administration for example intratumoral delivery of an il12 containing dna plasmid by injection followed by electroporation has shown promising activity in combination with pembrolizumab in a phase 1 study with patients with metastatic melanoma such an approach may be limited to accessible lesions amenable to electroporation in contrast it may be more feasible to inject our mrna delivered by our proprietary lnp into both accessible and visceral tumors 

medi1191 is being developed for the treatment of advanced or metastatic solid tumors in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor medi1191 consists of our proprietary lnp encapsulating an mrna for human il12b p40 and il12a p35 subunits the mrna produces a singlechain fusion protein of the il12b and il12a subunits with a linker between the subunits the mrna sequence has been engineered to enhance protein production and is designed to decrease the amount of protein that might be made in hepatocytes for better tolerability an illustration of our approach for il12 is shown in the figure below 

il12 medi1191 preclinical information 

we have conducted several preclinical studies in which we observed activity with our approach 

as described earlier our preclinical work was conducted with a mouse homolog of il12 in a tumor model that we have characterized as completely refractory to checkpoint therapy and associated with an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment treatment with il12 transformed the tumor microenvironment with notable activation of natural killer and dendritic cells and an increase in cytotoxic lymphocytes in this checkpoint inhibitor refractory mouse model of cancer a single dose of il12 mrna yielded around 

30 complete response rates as an mrna monotherapy as shown in panel a below and was synergistically active with systemically administered antipdl1 antibody or α pdl1 demonstrating complete response rates of   70 as shown in panel b of the figure below the xaxis represents days after subcutaneous implantation of mc38r tumor cells test articles were administered on day 11 for mrna treatments and on days 11 14 18 and 21 for antibody treatments all antibody treatments were administered at 20 mgkg there were 15 mice per group in this study survival curves were plotted by considering any reason a mouse was removed from study including the predetermined tumor burden endpoint of 2000 mm 3  as a survival event ntc is a nontranslating control mrna synergy of locally administered il12 mrna with systemic α pdl1 treatment was also observed on distal tumors that were not directly administered mrna

il12 medi1191 clinical plan 

astrazeneca will sponsor and lead the clinical development for medi1191 

we are responsible for generating a preclinical data package to support indcta filing and clinical supply for early clinical development astrazeneca will lead the early clinical development we expect a lower starting dose for medi1191 in the clinical trial compared to our other intratumoral programs 

we expect astrazeneca to initiate an openlabel international multicenter phase 1 clinical trial of intratumoral injections of medi1191 alone or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor and the ind for medi1191 is open 

iv program descriptions in our localized regenerative therapeutics modality 

we designed our localized regenerative therapeutics modality to develop mrna medicines to address injured or diseased tissues our mrna technology in this modality allows for the local production of proteins that provide a therapeutic benefit in the targeted tissue the development of our program in this modality azd8601 for the local production of vegfa is being led by our strategic collaborator astrazeneca this program recently completed a phase 1ab clinical trial in which we observed both a dosedependent protein production and a pharmacologic effect as measured by changes in local blood flow in patients we believe these data provide clinical proof of mechanism for our mrna technology outside of the vaccine setting as a potential therapeutic 

our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

localized regenerative therapeutics modality opportunity 

there are multiple applications for tissue regeneration with astrazeneca we have focused on ischemic heart failure for the first program coronary artery disease the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle in 2015 coronary artery disease resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally 

vegfa azd8601 program summary 

addressing ischemic heart failure—vegfa as a localized therapeutic in collaboration with astrazeneca 

heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states accounting for one in every four deaths and is often due to the inability of adult humans to regenerate heart tissue current approved therapies do not specifically address heart regeneration previous attempts at cardiac regeneration have included stem cell grafting and gene therapy but have faced challenges with safety or efficacy in collaboration with astrazeneca we are pioneering a unique approach to treating ischemic heart failure a condition where the cardiac muscle does not get enough blood supply to perform its contractile function vascular endothelial growth factor a or vegfa can promote cardiac tissue revascularization the goal of this program is to promote recovery of cardiac function through partial tissue regeneration the mrna in this program is in a saline formulation without lnps and is expected to act locally our strategic collaborator astrazeneca has conducted a phase 1ab clinical study in diabetic patients in europe the study has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of dosedependent protein production and changes in blood flow astrazeneca has moved this program to a phase 2a trial that is being conducted in europe and is designed to test safety and tolerability of epicardial injections for patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery 

vegfa azd8601 disease overview 

vegfa can promote blood vessel growth to potentially address ischemic heart failure 

heart disease is the leading cause of death in the united states accounting for one in every four deaths coronary artery disease or cad the primary cause of ischemic heart failure affects the arteries providing blood supply to the cardiac muscle cad resulted in 366000 deaths in the united states and 89 million deaths globally in 2015 

several treatments are available for patients with ischemic heart failure current treatments include revascularization of the coronary arteries to relieve symptoms and improve cardiac function and therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate excess fluids in congested tissues including betablockers angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii inhibitors and aldosterone receptor blockers as diuretics however adult humans are unable to regenerate myocardium tissue following injury and the treatment options described above cannot compensate for this 

vegfa is a potent angiogenic factor that promotes growth of blood vessels preclinical data suggests that expression of this growth factor in the ischemic heart could increase blood flow and partially restore cardiac function 

vegfa azd8601 our product concept 

local delivery of vegfa mrna to increase local concentration of vegfa protein while reducing systemic distribution of therapeutic vegfa protein 

vegfa protein acts as a powerful promoter of blood vessel growth systemic injection of vegfa protein increases vegfa exposure throughout the body which can lead to side effects but is very shortlived in circulation therefore any therapy involving vegfa needs to be localized to elevate local protein concentration and drive revascularization while minimizing systemic side effects astrazeneca has opted to pursue the localized application of vegfa mrna in a simple saline formulation in the heart muscle to elevate local protein concentration for longer periods due to increased local protein production this potentially allows for an extended pharmacodynamic effect at the specific site of injection compared to systemic or local administration of a recombinant 

protein version of vegfa some of the early animal work for mrna vegfa was published by our academic cofounder dr kenneth chien in  nature biotechnology  in 2013 showing improved cardiac function with increased survival with treatment 

vegfa azd8601 preclinical information 

astrazeneca has observed the activity of vegfa for ischemic heart failure in several preclinical animal models 

preclinical work has been conducted at astrazeneca in models of ischemic heart failure in mouse rat and pig models of myocardial infarction direct injection in the heart muscle myocardium of vegfa mrna led to elevated cardiac vegfa protein levels and improved cardiac function the data have been published by astrazeneca in  molecular therapy  in 2018 the table below illustrates the beneficial effects of azd8601 in the mini pig two months after the myocardial infarct procedure and injection of the vegfa mrna in this table left ventricular ejection fraction or lvef was measured using echocardiography two months after intracardial mrna administered 7 days after myocardial infarction the data are means ± standard error of the means 

significant improvement in lvef with vegf mrna measured 2 months after administration in mini pig study 



vegfa azd8601 clinical data 

astrazeneca has completed a phase 1ab trial in germany a phase 2a trial is currently ongoing in finland and an additional clinical trial application has been filed in the netherlands for this study 

the phase1ab clinical trial for the azd8601 program has met its primary objectives of describing safety and tolerability and secondary objectives of protein production and changes in blood flow post azd8601 administration astrazeneca has moved this program to a phase 2a trial 

the phase 1ab study was a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled study in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus vegfa mrna was administered by intradermal injection into the forearm skin in single ascending doses the study was conducted in europe the primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the drug product into the forearm skin with safety followup for 6 months 

the study was divided into part a single ascendingdose cohorts and part b pharmacodynamic cohort there were three treatment regimens in part a regimens were either azd8601 at site 1 and placebo at site 2 placebo at site 1 and azd8601 at site 2 or placebo at both sites each regimen comprised six 50 µl injections at one site and six 50 µl injections at a second site on the forearm in part b the regimen comprised one 50 µl intradermal injection of either azd8601 or placebo at each of four sites on the forearm 

there were 27 patients in part a with 18 receiving azd8601 in at least one site of the forearm and 9 patients receiving placebo there were three dose cohorts in part a each with 9 patients in the first cohort azd8601 dose was at 24 µg per patient 4 µg per injection the azd8601 dose was increased to 72 µg and 360 µg in the next two dose cohorts there were 15 patients in part b receiving azd8601 in at least two sites on the forearm per patient in part b each patient received 200 µg of azd8601 or placebo 

vegfa protein post injection of mrna was produced at a high level above the set expected threshold as shown in the figure below expression was measured by skin microdialysis at each sampling time mean vegfa protein levels across all mrna treated sites from patients across all cohorts were higher than that of placebo up to the 2426 hour time point data are means with error bars showing standard error of the mean or sem asterisk indicates pvalue 005 

vegfa protein levels in patients in part a of the phase 1ab trial 

the bioactivity of the vegfa protein post injection of mrna was observed by an increase in blood flow at injection sites up to 7 days following a single injection as shown in the figure below measurements were made using laser doppler imaging 7 and 14 days after administration study part a n  27 data shown are means with error bars showing sem asterisk indicates pvalue 005 

vegfa led to increase in blood flow at day 7 and day 14 in patients in the phase 1ab trial 

as shown above administration of azd8601 demonstrated protein production and changes in local blood flow in diabetic patients tolerability of our mrna injected intradermally was demonstrated for all dose levels the only causally treatmentrelated adverse events were mild injectionsite reactions occurring in 32 of 33 participants receiving vegfa mrna across both parts of the study design all adverse events of injectionsite reaction were of mild intensity no deaths serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation occurred a list of adverse events is provided in the table below 

adverse events for the phase 1ab trial for azd8601 



 the program is currently in a phase 2a clinical trial it is a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled multicenter phase 2a study to evaluate safety and tolerability of epicardial injections of azd8601 during coronary artery bypass grafting surgery some of the outcomes to be monitored in the phase 2a study include adverse and serious adverse events electrocardiogram or ecg and lvef the study is being conducted in europe the study is intentionally designed to provide initial safety and tolerability data in about 24 coronary artery bypass patients 

v program descriptions in our systemic secreted therapeutics modality 

we designed our systemic secreted therapeutics modality to increase levels of desired proteins in circulation or in contact with the extracellular environment we aim to use cells in the human body to produce proteins encoded by mrna that are secreted to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide secreted proteins such as antibodies or enzyme replacement therapies across a wide range of diseases such as heart failure infectious diseases and rare genetic diseases this modality has benefitted from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation 

this modality currently has three programs our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic secreted therapeutics modality opportunity 

the ability to systemically deliver mrna for a therapeutic effect would allow us to address a number of diseases of high unmet medical need systemically delivered secreted therapeutics address conditions often treated with recombinant proteins that are typically administered to the blood stream these current therapies include 

 our approach 

our systemic secreted therapeutics modality comprises programs where mrnas instruct various cells of the human body to secrete proteins for therapeutic effect for systemic therapeutic programs that utilize cells in the liver the liver is a highly productive tissue for secreted protein production the human liver can make tens of grams of proteins per day well above the amounts necessary for the pharmacologic effect for virtually all protein therapeutics we have demonstrated that mrna can make and secrete monoclonal antibodies and soluble modulating factors in nonhuman primates these proteins made in nonhuman primates can exert their pharmacological activity by binding to targets with biological effect 

the antibody against chikungunya virus is our first systemic secreted therapeutic and patients are currently being dosed in a phase 1 study it will help us understand the fundamental relationship between mrna dose and secreted protein production the secreted human antibody is also a protein complex not ordinarily made by the liver which will be a test case for making human proteins in liver normally made by other cell types 

this modality also includes engineered proteins such as our relaxin and pku programs and is not limited to native forms of proteins recombinant protein therapeutics which focus on secreted proteins generate over 200 billion in annual worldwide sales 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 summary 

systemic mrna administration to instruct cells to secrete antibodies in this case for passive immunization to prevent chikungunya infection 

we are using this program to help understand how mrna can be used to make complex secreted proteins in the human body and to address the potential health threat of chikungunya virus particularly for the military and others exposed to this virus this program highlights a potentially important advancement of our platform and expansion of our modalities 

chikungunya is a serious health problem with and is estimated to have caused at least three million cases during the 20052015 epidemic there are no vaccines or prophylactic treatments for this disease this virus can cause severe arthriticlike conditions in approximately 15 of the infected people this program offers a passive immunization approach using antibodies to prevent infection to complement our vaccine approach in this program we utilize two mrnas encoding for light chain and heavy chain of an antibody against the envelope glycoprotein e we plan to administer these mrnas encapsulated in our proprietary lnps intravenously to people to prevent infection by the chikungunya virus we are being financially supported for specific activities by darpa and have an open ind for mrna1944 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 disease overview 

addressing a significant global health need 

chikungunya virus is a mosquitoborne alphavirus posing a significant public health problem in tropical and subtropical regions while chikungunya has been present in africa for centuries recent outbreaks and epidemics in new regions have arisen due to the expanding distribution of the  aedes  mosquito in which it resides a chikungunya epidemic beginning in 2004 in kenya spread to india and was exported to nearly all regions of the world and brought chikungunya to the attention of the western world as of april 2016 chikungunya cases had been reported in 103 countries and territories around the world including 46 countries and territories throughout the americas chikungunya virus infection is characterized by an acute onset of fever rash myalgia and sometimes debilitating polyarthralgia giving the virus its name which means “that which bends up” when translated from makonde it is rarely fatal but neurological sequelae such as guillainbarre syndrome and chronic arthritis have been recognized 

chikungunya virus is an alphavirus of the togaviridae family with a positivestrand rna genome the viral structural proteins are naturally expressed as a single polyprotein followed by subsequent cleavage by viral and cellular proteases into capsid c and envelope e glycoproteins e3 e2 6k and e1 the e proteins are major targets of protective neutralizing antibody responses that can be tested for in assays 

there are currently no effective therapies or approved vaccines to treat or prevent chikungunya infection or disease and effective mosquito control has proven challenging even in higher income countries currently infected individuals are treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs to relieve some symptoms therefore in addition to an effective prophylactic vaccine we believe there is a need for systemic secreted antibody for passive immunity to the chikungunya virus 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 our product concept 

a systemically delivered mrna instructing cells to secrete an antibody to glycoprotein e to neutralize chikungunya 

the mrna1944 development candidate contains two mrnas that encode the heavy and light chains of the chikungunya antibody and utilizes our proprietary lnps the mrna1944 development candidate encodes a fully human igg antibody isolated from b cells of a patient with a prior history of chikungunya infection thus mrna1944 encodes a fully human igg antibody against the envelope protein e2 the systemic antibody against chikungunya virus titers can be evaluated in clinical trials by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay or elisa to quantify the amount of expressed igg a neutralization assay can be used to ensure that the mrna expressed antibody was properly folded and functional 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 preclinical information 

systemic mrna administration results in antibody production and protection from chikungunya infection in animals 

in immunodeficient ag129 mice lacking the ifnαß and  γ  receptors chikungunya causes a lethal disease and mice succumb to infection within 34 days with ruffled fur and weight loss protection in this model is mediated by antibodies against the chikungunya viral proteins that must provide complete protection or sterilizing immunity therefore this challenge model was used to establish a correlate of protection using activity and systemic igg concentration data 

an  in vivo  study in ag129 mice was completed to determine the activity of mrna encoded antibody against chikungunya virus the test article was administered to mice as prophylaxis at 002 01 and 05 mgkg by iv tail injection a subset of animals n10 were challenged 24 hours post prophylaxis with chikungunya virus strain lr006 and monitored for morbidity and mortality complete survival of mice was observed after treatment with the highest dose of 05 mgkg of mrna1944 

in addition the pharmacokinetics were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys through intravenous infusion at 03 10 and 30 mgkg the average serum antibody level was quantified at various time points to demonstrate a halflife of 23 days the maximum serum concentration of the antibody was found to be 162 µgml with dose 1 and 288 µgml with dose 2 as shown in the figure below 

expression of antibody against chikungunya virus with repeat dosing of mrna1944 or placebo in nonhuman primate study 

in addition mrna1944 was tested in rats and nonhuman primates in a repeatdose study via iv infusion up to 5 and 3 mgkg respectively there were no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna1944 observed and all other observations were generally reversible 

antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 clinical plan 

we have initiated dosing of a phase 1 trial of mrna1944 in the united states 

we are conducting a phase 1 single ascending dose study in healthy adults that is randomized and placebocontrolled the objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses 01 03 06 1 mgkg cohorts with 8 subjects per cohort of mrna1944 administered via intravenous infusion other objectives are to determine the pharmacokinetics of four dose levels of mrna1944 to determine if the antibodies produced are sufficiently active to neutralize viral infection in assays and to determine the pharmacodynamics of antichikungunya virus igg levels as of february 20 2019 dosing of the first dose level cohort has been completed 01 mgkg 8 subjects in the phase 1 trial of mrna1944 

each of the four dose level cohorts initially doses three sentinel subjects with a sevenday interval between each sentinel subject safety data on each sentinel subject as well as cumulative safety data are reviewed by the internal safety team or ist seven days following infusion of mrna1944 prior to the second and third sentinel subjects are dosed as per the schematic described below the ist will also review safety data for the three sentinels and recommend expansion to five subjects at that dose level with an overall randomization ratio of 32 mrna1944placebo the safety monitoring committee or smc reviews the safety data for the dose level and recommend escalation to the next dose level a schematic of the trial design is shown below 

blood samples will be collected at predefined time points post dose to determine mrna1944 concentration and concentration of encoded antibody against chikungunya virus 

relaxin azd7970 summary 

in collaboration with astrazeneca we are developing a secreted systemic engineered protein for heart failure 

chronic heart failure continues to be a leading cause of death worldwide while numerous treatments are currently available the needs of many heart failure patients are not met relaxin is a wellstudied natural protein hormone that is known to have cardiovascular protective effects earlier attempts at developing relaxin as a protein therapeutic have failed serelaxin a recombinant relaxin protein therapeutic with a short 30 minute halflife recently failed to meet its primary endpoints in a phase 3 trial we believe that engineering the relaxin protein for a longer duration and repeat dosing might overcome the shortcomings of earlier attempts in collaboration with astrazeneca we use mrna encoding for a relaxin protein designed for a long duration of action it is also designed to be produced by the body with human posttranslational modifications 

relaxin azd7970 disease overview 

heart failure continues to be a major health concern despite multiple treatment options 

heart failure is the inability of the heart to pump blood efficiently and presents itself as either an impairment of ejection of the blood systolic heart failure or defective ventricular filling diastolic heart failure it is associated with fluid retention in peripheral tissues including the lungs leading to tissue congestion dyspnea fatigue and ultimately death heart failure is a major unmet medical need as it is the leading cause of hospitalization in the elderly worldwide and accounts for 11 million cases annually in the united states the aging population and the improved survival rates from myocardial infarcts have increased the lifetime risk of developing heart failure to one in five 

current treatments for heart failure include therapies that reduce blood pressure or potentially help eliminate the excess of fluid in congested tissues betablockers angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors angiotensin ii inhibitors and aldosterone receptor blockers despite longterm combined treatments the needs for these patients are often unmet as evidenced by the high mortality rate in this patient population ie 365 in a median 3year followup 

relaxin is a naturally occurring hormone present in both men and women that has been shown to promote vasodilation and angiogenesis regulate extracellular matrix turnover and suppress arrhythmias post myocardial infarction though prior studies have failed to demonstrate longterm benefit in clinical studies we believe that our novel approach can overcome potential flaws of previous approaches 

relaxin azd7970 our product concept 

we have engineered a longacting relaxin to extend its otherwise short halflife 

azd7970 is an mrna encoding a human relaxin protein designed and engineered to have an extended halflife we have also utilized our proprietary lnps to enable repeat dosing we believe azd7970 can address the short halflife of serelaxin azd7970 is intended for ivadministered repeat dosing

fabry disease mrna3630 summary 

our approach to fabry disease with a secreted alpha galactosidase protein 

fabry disease is an xlinked hereditary defect in glycosphingolipid metabolism caused by mutations in the  gla  gene which encodes for the lysosomal protein alpha galactosidase or αgal it is one of a number of lysosomal storage diseases decreased activity of αgal results in the lysosomal accumulation of substrates gb3 and lysogb3 within cells and tissues ultimately impairing celltissue function currently there are several approved therapies for the treatment of fabry disease including enzyme replacement therapy or ert and chaperone therapy however patients continue to suffer from renal decline with erts and limited patient eligibility for chaperone therapy as well as immunogenic side effects of erts with our platform technology the cells in the human body can be instructed to produce αgal from the liver and other tissues to properly insert αgal into lysosomes additionally these tissues can secrete it into circulation for delivery to other tissues we are developing an intravenously administered mrna that encodes αgal enzyme and we plan to conduct a phase 12 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mrna3630 in fabry patients 

fabry disease mrna3630 disease overview 

fabry disease is a lysosomal storage disorder 

fabry disease is a progressive multiorgan xlinked lysosomal storage disorder with an annual incidence of approximately 180000 affected individuals have a deficiency in αgal resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize glycosphingolipids in the lysosomes thus patients accumulate glycosphingolipids such as gb3 within lysosomes which ultimately results in cellular and tissue dysfunction in fabry patients multiple organs are impacted including the kidney and heart and the vasculature gastrointestinal and neurological systems the severity of the disease is related to the lack of enzyme activity in patient cells classic fabry patients are the most affected individuals and generally retain 1 of normal enzyme activity diagnosis of fabry disease occurs generally during childhood but in some patients it is diagnosed later in life usually after the patient presents with a stroke or renal complications 

currently there are several approved therapies for the treatment of fabry disease agalsidase beta which is marketed as fabrazyme by sanofi genzyme and agalsidase alpha which is approved and marketed as replagal outside the united states by shire are enzyme replacement therapies or erts administered to most fabry patients both of those therapies are versions of αgal erts that are administered intravenously often require long infusion times and can lead to undesired immune reactions these enzymes are effective at decreasing substrate accumulation in some tissues and slowing disease progression however patients that have been on erts for 10 years still have renal function decline at a rate greater than normal healthy individuals in addition to erts amicus therapeutics has approval in the united states and european market for migalastat a small molecule chaperone therapy which treats a subset of patients 

fabry disease mrna3630 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce and secrete  α gal 

the mrna encoding αgal is designed to instruct the cells of the human body to produce complex functional intracellular proteins for utilization in the lysosome and secretion out of the cell for uptake by other tissues this is intended to replace the enzyme αgal insufficient or missing in fabry patients our mrna3630 program consists of an mrna encoding human αgal encapsulated in our proprietary lnp the mrna sequence is optimized for protein expression mrna3630 will be administered intravenously to encode enzymaticallyactive αgal protein to restore this deficient or defective enzyme 

an illustration of our approach is shown in the figure below the mrna encoding for αgal once inside the cell is translated to αgal protein by ribosomes and translocated to the endoplasmic reticulum the protein sequences traverse the secretory pathway of the cell the protein is either sent to the lysosome where it reduces the level of gb3 in target cells or is directed for secretion outside the cells allowing for broad distribution of the protein 

fabry disease mrna3630 preclinical information 

with a single dose of our mrna encoding for  α gal we observed a sustained reduction in lysogb3 

we have conducted several  in vivo  pharmacology studies to demonstrate nonclinical proofofconcept for αgal therapy administration of proprietary lnp formulated αgal mrna to the fabry mouse model resulted in a significant and durable reduction of globotriaosylsphingosine or lysogb3 in tissue and serum for 12 weeks following a single dose as shown in the figure below in this study there were 3 fabry gla  mice per group data was normalized to the control sequence group for the specific time point 

reduction in lysogb3 in tissue with single administration of  α gal mrna in mouse model study 

in addition we have evaluated plasma αgal in nonhuman primates following iv administration of 05 mgkg mrna3630 every other week for four doses there were four animals per group these data indicate consistent circulation of enzyme in circulation following repeated administrations as shown in the figure below 

repeat dosing of  α gal mrna in nonhuman primate study 

anti αgal antibodies were not detected in these animals nonhuman primate tissues were examined after the last dose and showed greater than wildtype levels of enzyme as determined by activity assessment and shown in the figure below the indenabling glp toxicology program for mrna3630 is ongoing

fabry disease mrna3630 clinical plan 

we plan to conduct a phase 12 open label clinical trial with multiple ascending doses to evaluate the safety tolerability and efficacy of our development candidate in patients 

vi program descriptions in our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality 

we designed our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality to increase levels of intracellular proteins we aim to use cells in the human body to produce proteins encoded by mrna that are located in the cytosol or specific organelles of the cell to achieve a therapeutic effect in one or more tissues or cell types the goal of this modality is to provide intracellular proteins such as intracellular enzymes and organellespecific proteins as safe tolerable and efficacious therapies our initial focus within this modality is on rare genetic diseases 

this modality currently has three programs our pipeline is shown in two formats with a cell map illustrating the diversity of biology addressed by our mrna pipeline programs and a traditional format that shows the current stages of development of our pipeline programs in the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “business—our pipeline” 

systemic intracellular therapeutics modality opportunity 

systemically delivered intracellular therapeutics focus on areas currently not addressable with recombinant proteins which are typically administered systemically and cannot reach the inside of the cell objectives for potential new therapies in this area include increasing the levels of 

 methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 summary 

program aims to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme to treat a pediatric genetic metabolic disorder 

isolated methylmalonic academia or mma is a rare lifethreatening inherited metabolic disorder that is primarily caused by a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonylcoenzyme a mutase or mut it primarily affects the pediatric population there is no approved therapy for the disorder including no approved enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of the protein and its mitochondrial localization liver or combined liverkidney transplant is one option for severely affected individuals our platform may allow the cells in the human body to produce these and other complex mitochondrial enzymes therefore we are developing an intravenously ivadministered mrna encoding mut in our proprietary lnp in order to restore this deficient or defective mitochondrial enzyme in the liver and other cells we have observed preclinical proofofconcept in two different mma mouse models notably with a marked improvement in survival and reduction of biochemical abnormalities in a severe mma mouse model and have received rare pediatric disease designation and orphan drug designation from the fda and orphan drug designation from the european commission the fda has also designated the investigation of mrna3704 for the treatment of isolated mma due to mut deficiency as a fast track development program we expect to initiate a phase 12 clinical trial in mma patients with mut deficiency and the ind for this phase 12 clinical trial is open 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 disease overview 

mma is a rare lifethreatening pediatric disorder with no approved therapies that address the underlying defect 

mma associated with mut deficiency is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality there are approximately 5002000 mma mut deficiency patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0312100000 newborns and mortality rates mortality is significant with reported mortality rates of 50 for mma patients with complete mut deficiency mut 0  median age of death 2 years and 40 for mma patients with partial mut deficiency mut   median age of death 45 years in a large european study 

mma mainly affects the pediatric population and usually presents in the first few days or weeks of life the occurrence of acute metabolic decompensations is the hallmark of the disorder and decompensations are typically more frequent in the first few years of life each decompensation is lifethreatening and often requires hospitalization and management at an intensive care unit surviving patients often suffer from numerous complications including chronic renal failure and neurologic complications such as movement disorders developmental delays and seizures consequently the healthrelated quality of life for mma patients and their families is significantly impaired 

the disorder is autosomal recessive and primarily caused by lossoffunction mutations in the gene encoding mut a mitochondrial enzyme that metabolizes certain proteins and fats resulting in complete mut 0  or partial mut   enzyme deficiency over 250 mutations have been reported to date for mut with many mma patients carrying private mutations the most frequent mutations include pn219y and pr369h occurring with allelic frequencies of 8 in a large european cohort n151 populationspecific mutations have been reported such as the pr108c and pg717v mutations identified in hispanic and africanamerican patients 

respectively due to a deficiency in the mut enzyme resulting in a blockage in a metabolic pathway the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as methylmalonic acid in all body fluids and tissues 

there are currently no approved therapies that address the underlying defect for mma carglumic acid marketed as carbaglu is approved in the eu for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including mma liver transplant and combined liverkidney transplant have emerged as effective treatment options for severely affected individuals resulting in substantial reductions in metabolic decompensations and circulating methylmalonic acid concentrations 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 our product concept 

we are utilizing our ability to produce a complex intracellular enzyme mut that is localized to the mitochondria 

mut is a complex intracellular enzyme that exists as a homodimer and requires mitochondrial localization and engagement with its cofactor a derivative of vitamin b 12   to be enzymatically active mrna has the capability to encode any type of protein including a functional intracellular protein that is trafficked to the proper subcellular localization within target cells 

we are developing an mrna encoding human mut encapsulated in our proprietary lnps for intravenous or iv administration for the treatment of isolated mma associated with mut deficiency the sequence has been engineered to improve protein translation to function the mrnaencoded mut protein is translocated to its site of action in the mitochondria as shown in the figure below 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 preclinical information 

we have observed pronounced improvement in survival due to mrna treatment in an mma mouse model 

we have conducted a series of  in vitro  and  in vivo  pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for human mut mrna in two different mouse models of mma representing the spectrum of mut deficiency mut 0  and mut    as published by us in  cell reports  in 2017 as an example a 12week repeatdose study in mma mut 0  mice  mut   tg insmck mut  at 05 mgkg iv every other week has shown a pronounced improvement in survival due to human mut mrna treatment with all treated mice surviving 12 weeks in contrast to control mice which all perished within a few weeks the figure below shows the kaplanmeier curve of pbsinjected n6 mice and human mut mrna n6 mice treated mma mut 0  mice and pbsinjected n6 mice healthy heterozygote mice the three asterisks indicate pvalue  0001 for human mut mrna vs pbsinjected mma mut 0  mice from the logrank test 

improved survival in a 12week study with mrna encoding for human mut in mouse disease model study 

in addition the data indicated that the treated mma mut 0  mice doubled their body weights and approached the body weights of pbsinjected healthy mice in this 12week repeat dose study in contrast surviving pbsinjected mma mut 0  mice did not gain weight 

increase in body weight in a 12week study with mrna encoding human mut in mouse disease model study 

hmut mrna treated mma mut 0  mice showed significant and sustained reductions in the toxic disease metabolites including plasma methylmalonic acid compared to pretreatment levels in a 6week repeat dose study in mma mut 0  mice this is shown in the figure below arrows denote weekly iv administration of human mut mrna 02 mgkg plasma was collected 4 days prior to treatment and 3 days after each dose administration washout levels were for the 10day washout following 5 th  dose administration of human mut mrna the asterisk indicates a pvalue  001 from paired ttests of posttreatment vs pretreatment levels 

decrease in plasma methylmalonic acid in 6week repeat dose study with mrna encoding for human mut in mma mut 0  mouse model study 

additionally a pharmacokinetic study performed in wild type mice demonstrated that human mut can be elevated above wild type level mut levels specifically human mut protein expression in liver peaked at 16 hours after a single iv injection of human mut mrna 05 mgkg with a concentration of 85 ngmg protein 23 fold higher than endogenous human and mouse mut in liver 

there were no doselimiting toxicities related to mrna3704 in juvenile rats and immature nonhuman primates in a repeat iv dose onemonth indenabling glp toxicology study up to the top doses tested an independent indenabling glp cardiovascular safety study in nonhuman primates also indicated mrna3704 showed no doselimiting toxicities 

methylmalonic acidemia mrna3704 clinical plan 

we are conducting a global natural history study and the ind for the phase 12 clinical trial is open 

we are conducting a global natural history study in methylmalonic acidemia or mma and propionic acidemia or pa that was initiated in 2018 some of the patients participating in the natural history study may enter our interventional clinical trials 

our natural history study aims to identify and correlate clinical and biomarker endpoints for both mma and pa we also have a pa program mrna3927 that addresses a disease closely related to mma there is synergy in combining the natural history study for mma and pa the natural history study is a global multicenter noninterventional study for patients with confirmed diagnosis of mma due to mut deficiency or pa up to 60 mma patients and up to 60 pa patients in the united states and europe will be followed prospectively for 13 years retrospective data will be collected as available as of february 27 2019 20 mma patients and 12 pa patients had enrolled in the natural history study 

we plan to conduct an openlabel multicenter dose escalation phase 12 study of multiple ascending doses of mrna3704 in patients with isolated mma due to mut deficiency between 1 to 18 years of age with elevated plasma methylmalonic acid concentrations the objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety pharmacodynamics as assessed by changes in plasma methylmalonic acid and pharmacokinetic profile of mrna3704 in patients affected by mma 

during the doseescalation phase three dose levels of mrna3704 are planned to be investigated in this study the first dose level will enroll adolescents aged 1218 once safety and tolerability is determined we intend to enroll patients who are between the ages of 1 and 18 years old an additional cohort to evaluate a fourth dose level may be considered patients will receive twelve doses of mrna3704 administered via iv infusion every 3 weeks 

three patients will be enrolled sequentially within each dose level cohort enrollment of the first three patients within each dose cohort will be staggered by 21 days using a sentinel dosing strategy approach to allow for safety observation after dosing for the evaluation of safety data prior to escalation to the next dose level a modified 33 design using predefined dose limiting toxicity criteria will be used dose escalation recommendations to open the next dose level cohort will be made by an independent smc and will include review of safety and pharmacodynamic activity through at least 21 days following the first dose administration of mrna3704 the dose limiting toxicity window for all patients 

upon establishment of a dose with acceptable safety and pharmacodynamic activity in dose escalation additional patients will be enrolled in a doseexpansion phase to allow for further characterization of the safety and pharmacodynamic activity of mrna3704 patients in both phases of study will participate in a predosing observational period to characterize baseline pretreatment biomarker levels followed by a treatment period and then a twoyear followup period after withdrawal of treatment 

the phase 12 study is expected to be conducted in the united states and europe a schematic of the trial is shown in the figure below 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 summary 

we aim to produce an intracellular mitochondrial enzyme complex to treat a pediatric metabolic disorder 

propionic acidemia or pa is a rare lifethreatening inherited metabolic disorder due to a defect in the mitochondrial enzyme propionylcoa carboxylase or pcc it primarily affects the pediatric population there is no approved therapy for pa including no approved enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of the enzyme which comprises six copies each of two different subunits pcca and pccb and its mitochondrial localization the only effective treatment for severely affected individuals is liver transplant aimed at increasing enzyme activity to reduce the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic crises our platform is uniquely positioned to potentially address this disease by enabling synthesis of this complex enzyme that is localized in the mitochondria of the cell we are developing an ivadministered mrna therapeutic comprising two different mrnas encoding pcca and pccb in our proprietary lnp to replace the defective pcc enzyme with functional enzyme in liver and other cells we expect to initiate a phase 12 clinical trial in pa patients 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 disease overview 

pa is an inherited metabolism disorder with significant morbidity and mortality and no approved therapy 

pa is a serious inborn error of metabolism disorder closely related to mma with significant morbidity and mortality there are approximately 3252000 pa patients in the united states based on estimated birth prevalence 0212100000 newborns and mortality rates the vast majority of patients present with lifethreatening metabolic crises during the first days or weeks of life with mortality rates ranging from 1353 during the neonatal period similar to mma the cardinal feature of the disorder is the occurrence of lifethreatening acute metabolic decompensations that are more frequent in the first few years of life longer term sequelae include cardiac complications cardiomyopathy arrhythmias and severe neurologic complications 

the disorder is caused by a defect or deficiency in pcc an enzyme that is one step upstream in the same metabolic pathway as the mut enzyme that is deficient in mma pcc is a complex heterododecamer enzyme composed of six alpha subunits pcca and six beta subunits pccb the disorder is autosomal recessive with pa patients generally having lossoffunction mutations in either pcca or pccb and in rare instances mutations in both pcca and pccb to date over 100 mutations have been identified for both pcca and pccb genes and similar to mma most of the mutations are private also similar to mma due to this enzyme deficiency resulting in a metabolic block the disorder is biochemically characterized by the accumulation of toxic metabolites such as 3hydroxypropionic acid and 2methylcitrate among others and these metabolites may be used as biomarkers of disease 

there is no approved therapy for pa to treat the underlying defect including no enzyme replacement therapy due to the complexity of pcc and mitochondrial localization carglumic acid marketed as carbaglu is approved in the eu for the acute treatment of hyperammonemia due to various organic acidemias including pa management of the disorder is otherwise limited to strict dietary restrictions and other supportive measures similar to mma liver transplant is a radical yet effective treatment with the aim of increasing pcc enzyme activity in liver for severely affected individuals 

propionic acidemia mrna3927 our product concept 

we are utilizing the strength of our platform to produce a complex enzyme comprising two different proteins that localize to the mitochondria 

the ability of our platform to encode for large multimeric complexes such as pcc and enable production of intracellular mitochondrial proteins makes mrna especially suited to potentially address pa we are developing an ivadministered combination mrna approach which contains two mrnas one for each of the subunits of pcc pcca and pccb encapsulated in our proprietary lnp the intent is to potentially treat the entire pa population regardless of whether an individual has a defect or deficiency in the pcc alpha or beta subunit the mrna sequences have been engineered to improve protein translation and encode enzymaticallyactive pcc with the proper subcellular localization in the mitochondria an illustration of our approach is shown in the figure below

propionic acidemia mrna3927 clinical plan 

we are conducting a global natural history study and are planning a phase 12 clinical trial 

the clinical development plan for mrna3927 includes a global natural history study that was initiated in 2018 and a planned phase 12 study in pediatric patients diagnosed with pa 

we have launched a natural history study aimed at identifying and correlating clinical and biomarker endpoints this is a global multicenter noninterventional study for patients with confirmed diagnosis of pa or mma due to mut deficiency up to 60 pa and 60 mma patients in the united states and europe will be followed prospectively for 13 years retrospective data will be collected as available as of february 27 2019 20 mma patients and 12 pa patients had enrolled in the natural history study

phenylketonuria mrna3283 summary 

our approach to phenylketonuria with an mrna encoding for an intracellular protein 

phenylketonuria or pku is a rare inherited metabolic disease resulting from a deficiency in the metabolism of phenylalanine or phe due to mutations within the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase or pah the most effective treatment is a restrictive diet of low protein which controls phe intake approximately 2056 of pku patients respond to sapropterin dihydrochloride marketed as kuvan in the united states a synthetic bh4 cofactor for pah which improves phe metabolism but does not fully cure patients in addition biomarin has received approval for pegylated phenylalanine lyase or pal marketed as palynziq palynziq is a pegylated recombinant bacterial enzyme which metabolizes phe in the blood we believe the immune risk is at least in part driven by bacterial pal with our mrna technology cells in the human body can be instructed to produce functional pah decreasing phe levels in the blood and restoring production of tyrosine we are developing an intravenously administered mrna which encodes for the pah enzyme and is encapsulated in our proprietary lnp we plan to conduct a phase 1 clinical trial for mrna3283 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 disease overview 

there are options to treat pku which are not widely applicable and efforts by other companies are likely to face hurdles 

pku occurs in approximately 11000015000 live births in the united states   based on current population estimates that would translate into approximately 2100032000 pku patients in the united states affected individuals have a deficiency in the enzyme pah resulting in a reduced or complete inability to metabolize the essential amino acid phenylalanine into tyrosine thus pku patients suffer from a phenylalanine intoxication and a subsequent deprivation of tyrosine leading to severe mental disability if left untreated 

pah is expressed as a monomer but functions as a tetramer and requires tetrahydrobiopterin bh4 as a cofactor to complete the conversion of phe to tyrosine thereby maintaining adequate phetyr ratios within circulation to date greater than 950 gene variants have been identified in the pah gene resulting in pku 

diagnosis of pku occurs primarily through newborn screening in available countries followed by genetic confirmation newly diagnosed patients receive medical formulas containing protein with low phe content to control blood phe and provide adequate nutrition for growing infants as patients age they are tested for sensitivity to synthetic bh4 and may transition to kuvan approximately 20 of patients respond favorably to kuvan which can aid in phe control nonresponsive patients are treated mainly with restricted diet however adherence to the diet is challenging resulting in poor compliance when phe levels are not adequately controlled patients begin to show multiple signs of disease including depression anxiety poor executive function and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or adhd in may 2018 biomarin received approval to market palynziq 

one option for pku patients may be treatment with gene therapy we believe there are potential advantages for mrna therapeutics for this disorder over gene therapy as described in the systemic intracellular therapeutics modality section 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 our product concept 

we intend to utilize the cells in the human body to produce pah intracellularly 

we believe mrna therapy is a viable therapeutic modality for pku patients due to its ability to instruct cells in the human body to produce complex functional intracellular proteins such as pah our program mrna3283 consists of an mrna encoding human pah encapsulated in our proprietary lnps the mrna sequence is optimized for protein synthesis and contains a microrna binding site to reduce or potentially eliminate synthesis of protein outside of the target tissues mrna3283 is designed to be administered intravenously to encode enzymaticallyactive pah protein in liver to restore this deficient or defective enzyme as illustrated in the figure below 

phenylketonuria mrna3283 preclinical information 

we have demonstrated the ability to impact phe levels by repeat dosing of our mrna in preclinical studies 

we have conducted several  in vitro  and  in vivo  pharmacology studies to demonstrate preclinical proofofconcept for pah therapy a pku mouse model demonstrated a significant reduction of blood phe levels post dose as shown in the figure below the study included iv administration of pah mrna every 7 days at 05 mgkg in a pah mouse model data point with asterisk is marked zero since it was not collected due to a snow storm phe level was measured using liquid chromatography with a combination of two mass analyzers lcmsms the indenabling glp toxicology program for pku mrna3283 is ongoing

we plan to conduct a phase 1 open label clinical trial with single ascending dose to evaluate the safety tolerability and activity of our development candidate in patients 

manufacturing product supply and technical development 

we believe manufacturing plays a critical role in our value chain and ability to develop a new class of medicines our manufacturing capabilities currently support the research engine and the early development engine with future plans to support demand from the late stage development and commercial engine within the research engine our manufacturing provides mrna drug substance and formulated drug product for platform research and therapeutic area drug discovery for the early development engine we manufacture mrna and drug product for indenabling glp toxicology studies and initial human clinical studies our approach to date has been to proactively build capacity in anticipation of demand from internal research and development as well as from our strategic collaborators we have done so by making significant investments in our internal manufacturing capability and in a network of external manufacturing partners 

overview of our manufacturing operating model 

our manufacturing activities focus on the following 

 we have invested in a dedicated inhouse manufacturing facility in norwood ma given our expectations for significant ongoing pipeline expansion and the long lead time required in building manufacturing infrastructure through december 31 2018  we had net capitalized costs of approximately 140 million related to our norwood facility the facility is approximately 200000 square feet can scale up to 100 cgmp lots per year and can accommodate over 200 of our employees this facility is expected to support our research engine supply indenabling glp toxicology study supplies and our phase 1 and phase 2 pipeline activities and potentially laterstage clinical development activities as well as certain commercial activities 

norwood includes the following areas 

 the facility has been designed with a high level of automation and digital integration of manufacturing records and data in addition we have deployed an automated material and resource management system a manufacturing execution system a laboratory execution system a laboratory information management system and an asset and document management system to ensure the digital integration of our manufacturing product testing and release and regulatory filings 

manufacturing technology development 

in order to support our broad pipeline of products spanning multiple therapeutic areas and multiple routes of administration the technology underpinning product manufacturing is critical to our success over the last few years we have invested heavily in this technology to enable the breadth and depth of our pipeline and to prepare us to meet future needs and requirements as our programs enter later phases of development and commercialization 

our technology efforts are intended to span the development of robust and consistent manufacturing processes assays to fully characterize the product and fitforpurpose formulations and product presentations in addition manufacturing activities include the development of novel hardware platforms that incorporate significant automation and robotics which are applicable broadly across programs but also specifically to personalized cancer vaccines all of these activities are being developed with a focus on achieving appropriate cost of goods and scalability 

our advances over the last few years have enabled us to more efficiently scale our mrna and drug product manufacturing at successfully larger production yields we have made significant investments in analytical characterization to determine critical product quality attributes and enable manufacturing site and scale changes over the course of development in addition pharmaceutical readiness of our drug product has enabled a wide variety of routes of administration eg intramuscular intratumoral and intravenous 

we have also invested in the establishment of technology for the manufacture of some of our key raw materials including dna plasmid and many small molecules this vertical integration allows us to exert significant control over the value chain though we will continue to use a combination of internal and external manufacture of these raw materials 

supply of mrna for the research engine and early development engine 

supply for the research engine 

we believe that our internal manufacturing capacity is key to the advancement of our platform technology development and therapeutic area discovery efforts high throughput automation and customengineered equipment enable us to produce multiple high quality mrna and formulated constructs within a limited timeframe from order to delivery we currently have infrastructure capable of producing up to 1000 lots of mrna sequences and formulations per month with a turnaround time of a few weeks from sequence to final product the typical scale of mrna manufactured by this team is 110 mg 

supply for the early development engine 

analogous to the research engine we have proactively established manufacturing capabilities for the early development engine we started supplying product to enable indenabling glp toxicology studies and for human clinical studies meeting required cgmp standards with a combination of internal manufacturing at our cambridge headquarters and external manufacturing at wellestablished contract manufacturing organizations or cmos norwood has the capability and capacity to produce research and clinical supply for our programs as well as to enable technology development and scaleup for future needs we will continue to selectively use cmos to complement our internal capacity to provide supply contingency and expanded capability where needed 

this extensive capacity has helped enable our broad pipeline of 20  development candidates including the significant output necessary to supply our toxicological and human clinical studies though the underpinnings of the technology utilized across these 20  programs are the same each program typically requires customization driven in part by its target product profile these custom features range from varying molecular architecture to different routes of administration and often necessitate multivalent products for example our cmv vaccine mrna1647 requires six different mrna sequences to be manufactured for inclusion in an intramuscular mrna medicine whereas ox40l mrna2416 requires a single mrna sequence for inclusion in an intratumoral mrna medicine all programs with the exception of pcv require that we scale up supply over time to meet the clinical demand required in the different phases of development and prepare the process for regulatory approval and eventually commercial supply where bigger batch sizes will be required in contrast the pcv program is designed to provide each patient with a cancer vaccine that is designed and manufactured for that specific patient thus increasing the number of batches to match the number of patients treated as we scale the manufacturing output for particular programs we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates from indenabling glp toxicology studies through commercial launch including improvement to shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance typically after a change in process more time may be required for pharmaceutical property testing such as 6 or 12month stability testing this time lag may necessitate resupplying clinical materials or making additional cgmp batches to meet clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed 

supply of mrna and formulated product for toxicology studies  early on we established the internal capability to produce mrna and formulated product for indenabling glp toxicology studies for our development candidates under glp standards 

supply of cgmp mrna and formulated product for human clinical studies  we have incrementally built the capability to produce and supply mrna drug product for clinical development in our early years we outsourced cgmp supply we selected specialized cmos to support a total of five programs by the end of 2015 in 2016 we built and qualified two cgmp suites in our cambridge facility for the manufacture of mrna drug substance and formulated drug product while we had the internal capability to produce drug product we continued to work with our external cmo network for redundant capacity and to provide sterile filling capability 

cgmp manufacture of pcv  due to the specialized nature of personalized medicine in which a batch is specifically manufactured for a single patient the pcv program has unique requirements in this program we digitally integrate patientspecific data from 

sequencing tumor samples and automatically design pcvs for patients we have developed proprietary bioinformatics design algorithms and have linked them to an automated manufacturing process for rapid production of formulated mrna that can be turned around in a matter of weeks the pcv manufacturing capability is termed personalized vaccine unit or pvu pcv manufacturing is conducted using custom automated and engineering solutions utilizing singleuse systems with fast “needletoneedle” turnaround time we have operationalized pcv manufacture within our external cmo network to meet our phase 1 supply needs while in parallel working to internalize manufacturing unlike traditional process development where the product is scaled up in quantity for later phases of development and commercialization each pcv is manufactured for a single patient and thus scaledout with extensive use of automation and robotics for the larger numbers of patients involved in later phases of development and commercialization 

supply for the late stage development and commercialization engine 

as our pipeline advances to later stage development and potential commercialization we will need to evolve our manufacturing suites and other capabilities at norwood we believe at this time the modular nature of the norwood suites will permit us to manufacture drug substance and drug product for a number of registrational trials and potentially drug substance and drug product for commercialization for certain rare disease indications in other instances we may build additional capabilities to support our late stage development and commercialization engine 

quality unit 

quality is core to the way we operate we seek to ensure quality at moderna through a combination of a robust quality management system or qms our quality culture and through our people in accordance with applicable regulations we have established documented and implemented a qms to assure continued compliance with the requirements therein the qms facilitates cgmp compliance by implementing practices that identify the various processes required by the qms their application throughout the organization and the sequence of interaction of these processes 

the primary mode of documenting these key practices is through policies standard operating procedures forms and other quality records which include an overarching quality policy and quality manual we have implemented measurement tools and metrics to monitor measure and analyze these practices to support cgmp operations achieve planned results and support continuous improvement we monitor these quality metrics through formal governance processes including quality management review or qmr and our quality council to enable continuous improvement we have also established an independent quality unit that fulfills quality assurance and quality control responsibilities 

while the quality unit is ultimately accountable and responsible for quality quality is everyone’s responsibility all cgmp personnel are empowered to ensure quality systems are appropriately maintained and executed 

we have established a culture that encourages transparency accountability and ownership of quality at all levels in the organization as we scale the quality organization we have focused on hiring the best talent with the required experience training and education 

supply chain unit 

we have established a robust supply chain to enable sufficient supply of the raw materials used to produce our mrnas and components of our formulations we have worked with our supply chain vendors to characterize critical raw materials and to understand their impact on the quality of mrna drug substance and formulated drug product we have also assessed the quality system and performance of our supply chain vendors and worked with them to comply with regulatory requirements 

digital infrastructure 

we believe that digital technologies such as robotics automation artificial intelligence and cloud computing are critical to operationalize our strategy accelerate our pace of learning and execute at scale our approach to bring these digital technologies into our workflows and processes has involved the following 

 we have seen several benefits from our investments in digitization most importantly through the depth of our platform technology and breadth of our pipeline other benefits include 

 our digital building blocks 

we utilize six building blocks for our digital infrastructure 

 digital technologies to enable our research engine 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies across our research engine to drive a rapid pace of learning enable efficient workflows and business processes and draw insights from vast amounts of data our aim is to provide our platform and discovery scientists with access to an environment that helps them through each step of their research cycle 

drug design studio  our proprietary inhouse digital application suite contains a sequence designer module to tailor an entire mrna with everimproving rule sets that contain our accumulated learning about mrna design drug design studio utilizes cloudbased computational capacity to run various algorithms we have developed to design each mrna sequence the utility of cloudbased capacity allows us to provide flexible computational capacity on demand allowing the research engine to power parallel intake and design of multiple mrna sequences once a sequence is designed it can be ordered digitally using an internal order form application within drug design studio 

manufacture of research grade mrna  once an order is optimized the mrna production process is triggered we have developed proprietary interfaces that allow the manufacturing team to track production orders at every stage we have automated several manufacturing steps using both offtheshelf and custom automation the equipment used in the manufacture of researchgrade mrna is integrated with the digital interfaces to capture extract and interpret the data generated at each step of the manufacturing process building digital traceability on each mrna order we have also embedded realtime algorithms and analytics tools to allow for automated decisionmaking at some stages accelerate the quality control workflows and provide for continuous improvement of manufacturing processes 

dispatching and shipping mrna  because we produce large quantities of researchgrade mrna we require digital tools to track their shipment to our scientists and to external contract research organizations or cros conducting  in vivo  studies our dispatching and shipping application automatically generates barcoded labels allowing for traceability of product 

inventory and registry  material used in research and created in production including mrna cell lines chemicals and reagents is tracked in our inventory application this application supports numerous workflow tools such as consumption aliquoting material transfer and stock alerts critical material types are assigned unique registry identification by our registry application 

study design  using our drug design studio our scientists can design their  in vivo  studies using our proprietary study design application this application captures  in vivo  study protocol design parameters including dose amount number of doses frequency samples and assays for each sample this application serves two purposes it allows our scientists to maintain and track their  in vivo  study designs and associated research grade mrna our study design application also allows our  in vivo  pharmacology teams to track the various ongoing studies and leverage external cros to manage the  in vivo  demand as needed 

experiment management  we have deployed electronic lab notebooks for experiment management allowing our scientists to streamline documentation of their experiments and track it in a standardized searchable repository we have also integrated electronic lab notebooks further with our other research tools to connect inventory  in vivo  studies and instrument data 

advanced analytics and ai to accelerate the pace of learning  we utilize ai to enable various parts of our platform and drug discovery examples include 

 digital technologies to enable our early development engine 

we have deployed multiple digital technologies across our early development engine to drive the rapid pace of advancement in parallel of our development candidates into the clinic 

digital systems for cgmp manufacture  we are committed to having integrated systems connected with robotics to drive our manufacturing in a paperless environment and have designed and deployed automation to drive efficient manufacturing operations we have also deployed digital tools within manufacturing process development that give us the ability to track analyze and rapidly deploy manufacturing process improvements additionally we have implemented several digital systems across manufacturing process development quality supply chain and operations including 



 digital systems for clinical development and clinical operations  in order to track the timelines of various development candidates through the early development engine we have created a set of integrated applications workflows include timelines for regulatory filings planning for indenabling glp toxicology studies scheduling for cgmp manufacturing and clinical operations management below is a summary of our applications 

 digital systems for pcv  the pcv program aims to design manufacture and deliver a drug product that includes an mrna sequence encoding for each patient’s specific neoantigens the personalized nature of the pcv program adds additional steps and complexity in the overall patient treatment process we have addressed those additional steps and complexity by digitizing and automating steps within the process as described below 

 digital technologies to support our business processes 

we have deployed several digital systems across finance manufacturing and human resources to automate our business processes and drive efficiencies we have implemented the sap s4hana system for erp in december 2016 we implemented the finance procurement and inventory management modules and further scaled the erp to support manufacturing quality and supply chain in september 2017 and added the norwood site and processes in july 2018 we have implemented various cloudbased solutions to improve business processes and drive efficiencies for example we have implemented the workday system for human resource planning and management and integrated various applications across payroll 401k services equity plan management and expense reporting 

thirdparty strategic alliances 

strategic alliances 

to accelerate the discovery and advancement of potential mrna medicines across therapeutic areas we have entered into and intend to seek other opportunities to form alliances with a diverse group of strategic collaborators we have forged productive strategic alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies government agencies academic laboratories foundations and research institutes with therapeutic area expertise and resources in an effort to advance our discovery and development programs while leveraging our platform and our research and early development engines 

one key principle of our approach to strategic alliances is to share the rewards and risks of developing a new mrna modality where we may have early research data and desire a strategic collaborator to join us in advancing early development candidates within such modality into the clinic representative relationships and associated programs include the following 

 we view strategic alliances as important drivers for accelerating execution of our goal of rapidly developing mrna medicines to treat patients across a wide range of medical and disease challenges to maintain the integrity of our platform the terms of our agreements with our strategic collaborators generally provide that our strategic collaborators receive rights to develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines that we design and manufacture as opposed to rights to use our platform to generate new mrna and that we generally own mrnarelated intellectual property arising from research activities performed under the strategic alliance 

we plan to continue to identify potential strategic collaborators who can contribute meaningful resources and insights to our programs and allow us to more rapidly expand our impact to broader patient populations

the cellscriptmrt agreements will expire upon the expiration or abandonment of the last to expire or become abandoned of the penn modified mrna patents cellscript or mrt as applicable may terminate its respective cellscriptmrt agreement if we fail to make required payments or otherwise materially breach the applicable agreement subject to specified notice and cure provisions cellscript or mrt as applicable may also terminate the applicable cellscriptmrt agreement upon written notice in the event of our bankruptcy or insolvency or if we challenge the validity or enforceability of the penn modified mrna patents we have the right to terminate each cellscriptmrt agreement at will upon 60 days’ prior notice to cellscript or mrt as applicable provided that we cease all development and commercialization of licensed products upon such termination if rights to mrt or cellscript under the penn modified mrna patents are terminated eg due to bankruptcy of mrt or cellscript the terminated party will assign its interest in the respective cellscriptmrt agreement to the licensor from which it received rights under the penn modified mrna patents and our rights will continue under the new licensor 

formulation technology inlicenses 

our development candidates use internally developed formulation technology that we own we do however have rights to use and exploit multiple issued and pending patents covering formulation technologies under licenses from other entities if in the future we elect to use or to grant our strategic collaborators sublicenses to use these inlicensed formulation technologies we or our strategic collaborators may be liable for milestone and royalty payment obligations arising from such use we consider the commercial terms of these licenses and their provisions regarding diligence insurance indemnification and other similar matters to be reasonable and customary for our industry 

in addition we have entered into material transfer agreements that have provided us with opportunities to evaluate third party delivery systems 

employees 

we have approximately 760  fulltime employees 51 of whom hold phd md jd or master’s degrees among our employees 44 identify as female 55 identify as male and 1 have chosen not to identify themselves or selected other none of our employees is represented by a labor union and none of our employees has entered into a collective bargaining agreement with us we consider our employee relations to be good 

we believe that our employees are highly engaged and we have for the last four years been recognized by surveys conducted by external groups  science  magazine ranked us as a top 10 employer for the last four years we were ranked 7 in 2015 3 in 2016 6 in 2017 and 4 in 2018 we were also named a top workplace by the  boston globe  in 2016 and 2017

competition 

the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries utilize rapidly advancing technologies and are characterized by intense competition there is also a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products 

we believe that mrna as a medicine coupled with our capabilities across mrna technology drug discovery development and manufacturing provide us with a competitive advantage however we will continue to face competition from different sources including major pharmaceutical companies biotechnology companies academic institutions government agencies and public and private research institutions for any products that we eventually commercialize we will not only compete with existing therapies but also compete with new therapies that may become available in the future 

we compete in the segment of pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries there are additional companies that are working on potential mrna medicines companies with clinical programs with mrna include biontech curevac etherna immunotherapies and translate bio and those with preclinical programs include arcturus therapeutics ethris genevant sciences and glaxosmithkline 

government regulation 

government authorities in the united states at the federal state and local level and in other countries regulate among other things the research development testing manufacture quality control approval labeling packaging storage recordkeeping promotion advertising distribution postapproval monitoring and reporting marketing and export and import of drug and biological products such as our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines generally before a new drug or biologic can be marketed considerable data demonstrating its quality safety and efficacy must be obtained organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority 

us drug and biological product development 

in the united states the fda regulates drugs under the federal food drug and cosmetic act or fdca and its implementing regulations and biologics under the fdca the public health service act or phsa and their implementing regulations both drugs and biologics also are subject to other federal state and local statutes and regulations the process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal state and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources failure to comply with the applicable us requirements at any time during the product development process approval process or following approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions these sanctions could include among other actions the fda’s refusal to approve pending applications withdrawal of an approval license revocation a clinical hold untitled or warning letters voluntary or mandatory product recalls market withdrawals product seizures total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions fines refusals of government contracts restitution disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 

our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines must be approved by the fda through a bla or nda process before they may be legally marketed in the united states the process generally involves the following 



 the preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time effort and financial resources and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines will be granted on a timely basis or at all 

preclinical studies 

before testing any biological or drug candidate including our product candidates in humans the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation as well as  in vitro  and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use the conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements including glp regulations for safetytoxicology studies an ind sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests together with manufacturing information analytical data any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies among other things to the fda as part of an ind an ind is a request for authorization from the fda to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin some longterm preclinical testing may continue after the ind is submitted an ind automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the fda unless before that time the fda raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold in such a case the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin as a result submission of an ind may not result in the fda allowing clinical trials to commence 

clinical trials 

the clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control in accordance with gcp requirements which include the requirement that all patients provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing among other things the objectives of the clinical trial dosing procedures subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy each protocol and any subsequent amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind furthermore each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an irb for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits the irb also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed there also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries information about certain clinical trials including clinical trial results must be submitted within specific timeframes for publication on the wwwclinicaltrialsgov website 

where a gene therapy study is conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving national institutes of health or nih funding for recombinant dna research prior to the submission of an ind to the fda in the past a protocol and related documentation have been submitted to and the study registered with the nih office of science policy or osp pursuant to the nih guidelines for research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules or nih guidelines compliance with the nih guidelines is mandatory for investigators at institutions receiving nih funds for research involving recombinant dna however many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the nih guidelines voluntarily follow them pursuant to the nih guidelines research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules must be approved by an institutional biosafety committee or ibc a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution the ibc assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment the nih also has been responsible for convening the recombinant dna advisory committee or rac a federal advisory committee that discusses protocols that raise novel or particularly important scientific safety or ethical considerations at one of its quarterly public meetings the osp notified the fda of the rac’s decision regarding the necessity for full public review of a gene therapy protocol rac proceedings and reports are posted to the osp web site and may be accessed by the public in august 2018 the nih published a notice in the federal register to seek public comment on its proposal to amend the nih guidelines to streamline oversight for human gene transfer clinical research protocols and reduce duplicative reporting requirements while focusing the nih guidelines more specifically on biosafety issues associated with research involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules the notice included proposed amendments to eliminate rac review and reporting requirements to nih for human gene transfer research protocols and to modify the roles and responsibilities of investigators institutions ibcs the rac and the nih to be consistent with these goals during the comment 

period and effective august 2018 the nih stated it will no longer accept new human gene transfer protocols for the protocol registration process under the nih guidelines or convene the rac to review individual human gene transfer protocols the nih office of science policy also will not accept annual reports safety reports amendments or other documentation for any previously registered human gene transfer protocols under the nih guidelines the roles and responsibilities of ibcs at the local level will continue as described in the nih guidelines such trials remain subject to fda and other clinical trial regulations and only after fda ibc and other relevant approvals are in place can these protocols proceed during this time ibcs and irbs will not be required to submit documentation to the nih assessing whether a particular protocol meets the criteria for rac review 

a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the united states may but need not obtain fda authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an ind if a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an ind the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the fda in support of a bla or nda the fda will accept a welldesigned and wellconducted foreign clinical study not conducted under an ind if the study was conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the fda is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection if deemed necessary 

clinical trials generally are conducted in three sequential phases known as phase 1 phase 2 and phase 3 and may overlap 

 in august 2018 the fda released a draft guidance entitled “expansion cohorts use in firstinhuman clinical trials to expedite development of oncology drugs and biologics” which outlines how drug developers can utilize an adaptive trial design commonly referred to as a seamless trial design in early stages of oncology drug development ie the firstinhuman clinical trial to compress the traditional three phases of trials into one continuous trial called an expansion cohort trial information to support the design of individual expansion cohorts are included in ind applications and assessed by fda expansion cohort trials can potentially bring efficiency to drug development and reduce developmental costs and time 

postapproval trials sometimes referred to as phase 4 clinical trials may be conducted after initial marketing approval these trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting in certain instances the fda may mandate the performance of phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a bla or nda 

progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials among other information must be submitted at least annually to the fda and written ind safety reports must be submitted to the fda and the investigators 15 calendar days after the trial sponsor determines the information qualifies for reporting for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events findings from other studies or animal or  in vitro  testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure the sponsor also must notify the fda of any unexpected fatal or lifethreatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information 

phase 1 phase 2 phase 3 and other types of clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period if at all the fda or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds including a finding that the patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk similarly an irb can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the irb’s requirements or if the drug or biologic has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients additionally some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor known as a data safety monitoring board or committee this group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial concurrent with clinical trials companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug or biologic as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cgmp requirements the manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product and among other things companies must develop methods for testing the identity strength quality and purity of the final product additionally appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the investigational medicines do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their shelf life 

fda review process 

following completion of the clinical trials data are analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the fda as part of a bla or nda along with proposed labeling chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data a bla is a request for approval to market a biologic for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of the biologic’s safety purity and potency an nda for a new drug must contain proof of the drug’s safety and efficacy the marketing application may include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials as well as positive findings data may come from companysponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources including studies initiated by investigators to support marketing approval the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the fda fda approval of a bla or nda must be obtained before a biologic or drug may be marketed in the united states 

under the prescription drug user fee act or pdufa as amended each bla or nda must be accompanied by a user fee the fda adjusts the pdufa user fees on an annual basis fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business additionally no user fees are assessed on blas or ndas for products designated as orphan drugs unless the product also includes a nonorphan indication 

the fda reviews all submitted blas and ndas before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the bla or nda for filing the fda must make a decision on accepting a bla or nda for filing within 60 days of receipt and such decision could include a refusal to file by the fda once the submission is accepted for filing the fda begins an indepth review of the bla or nda under the goals and policies agreed to by the fda under pdufa the fda has 10 months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of an original bla or nda for a new molecular entity and respond to the applicant and six months from the filing date of an original bla or nda designated for priority review the fda does not always meet its pdufa goal dates for standard and priority blas and ndas and the review process is often extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 

before approving a bla or nda the fda will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cgmp requirements the fda will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cgmp requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications 

the fda also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with gcp requirements additionally the fda may refer applications for novel products or products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts for review evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions if any the fda is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval the fda likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data which could result in extensive discussions between the fda and the applicant during the review process after the fda evaluates a bla or nda it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter an approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the biologic or drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications a complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form a complete response letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the bla or nda identified by the fda the complete response letter may require additional clinical data additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trials andor other significant and timeconsuming requirements related to clinical trials preclinical studies or manufacturing if a complete response letter is issued the applicant may either resubmit the bla or nda addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application or request an opportunity for a hearing even if such data and information are submitted the fda may decide that the bla or nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data 

orphan drug designation 

under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200000 individuals in the united states or more than 200000 individuals in the united states and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the united states for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product 

orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a bla or nda after the fda grants orphan drug designation the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the fda orphan drug designation on its own does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 

if a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval except in limited circumstances such as 

a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues competitors however may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication in the latter case because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for offlabel uses the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same drug and same indication as defined by the fda for which we are seeking approval or if our product is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease if we pursue marketing approval for an indication broader than the orphan drug designation we have received we may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity orphan drug status in the european union or eu has similar but not identical requirements and benefits 

expedited development and review programs 

the fda has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biologics that meet certain criteria specifically new drugs and biologics are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied the sponsor can request the fda to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving bla or nda approval but ideally no later than the prebla or prenda meeting any product submitted to the fda for marketing including under a fast track program may be eligible for other types of fda programs intended to expedite development and review such as priority review and accelerated approval any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and if approved would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies the fda will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biologic designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review 

a product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or lifethreatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies in addition it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality or imm that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on imm or other clinical benefit as a condition of approval the fda may require that a sponsor of a drug or biologic receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and wellcontrolled postmarketing clinical trials if the fda concludes that a drug or biologic shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted it will require such postmarketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product if the fda determines that the conditions of approval are not being met the fda can withdraw its accelerated approval for such drug or biologic 

additionally a drug or biologic may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics to treat a serious or lifethreatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints the benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation plus intensive guidance from the fda to ensure an efficient drug development program 

even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs the fda may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or the time period for fda review or approval may not be shortened furthermore fast track designation priority review accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process 

pediatric information 

under the pediatric research equity act as amended a bla or nda or supplement to a bla or nda must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective the fda may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient new indication new dosage form new dosing regimen or new route of administration must submit an initial pediatric study plan or psp within 60 days of an endofphase 2 meeting or if there is no such meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 23 study the initial psp must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct including study objectives and design age groups relevant endpoints and statistical approach or a justification for not including such detailed information and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information the fda and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the psp a sponsor can submit amendments to an agreedupon initial psp at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies early phase clinical trials andor other clinical development programs 

postmarketing requirements 

following approval of a new product the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the fda including among other things monitoring and recordkeeping activities reporting of adverse experiences complying with promotion and advertising requirements which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations known as ‘‘offlabel use’’ and limitations on industrysponsored scientific and educational activities although physicians may prescribe legally available products for offlabel uses manufacturers may not market or promote such uses prescription drug and biologic promotional materials must be submitted to the fda in conjunction with their first use further if there are any modifications to the drug or biologic including changes in indications labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities the applicant may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new bla or nda or bla or nda supplement which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials 

the fda may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems to assure the safe use of the product if the fda concludes a rems is needed the sponsor of the bla or nda must submit a proposed rems the fda will not approve the bla or nda without an approved rems if required a rems could include medication guides physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use such as restricted distribution methods patient registries and other risk minimization tools any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion distribution prescription or dispensing of products newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a drug’s approved labeling including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures including a rems or the conduct of postmarketing studies to assess a newly discovered safety issue product approvals may be withdrawn for noncompliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 

fda regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cgmp regulations in addition to our own manufacturing facilities we rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production of certain clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cgmp regulations we and these manufacturers must comply with cgmp regulations that require among other things quality control and quality assurance the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cgmp manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with cgmp requirements and other laws accordingly manufacturers must continue to expend time money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cgmp compliance the discovery of violative conditions including failure to conform to cgmp regulations could result in enforcement actions and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product manufacturer or holder of an approved bla or nda including recall 

us patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 

depending upon the timing duration and specifics of fda approval of our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines some of our us patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of 1984 commonly referred to as the hatch waxman amendments the hatch waxman amendments permit restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and fda regulatory review process patent term restoration however cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date the patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an ind and the submission date of a bla or nda plus the time between the submission date of a bla or nda and the approval of that application except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent the uspto in consultation with the fda reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in the future we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond the current expiration date depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant bla or nda 

marketing exclusivity provisions under the fdca can also delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications the fdca provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an nda or supplement to an existing nda if new clinical investigations other than bioavailability studies that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the fda to be essential to the approval of the application for example for new indications dosages or strengths of an existing drug this threeyear exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the fda from approving abbreviated new drug applications or andas for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use the fdca also provides a fiveyear period of nonpatent marketing exclusivity within the united states to the first applicant to obtain approval of an nda for a new chemical entity a drug is a new chemical entity if the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance 

during the exclusivity period the fda may not accept for review an anda or a 505b2 nda submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval however an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or noninfringement to one of the patents listed with the fda by the innovator nda holder threeyear and fiveyear exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full nda however an applicant submitting a full nda would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy 

an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdalicensed reference biological product was created by the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 or bpci act this amendment to the phsa in part attempts to minimize duplicative testing biosimilarity which requires that the biological product be highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the product and the reference product in terms of safety purity and potency can be shown through analytical studies animal studies and a clinical trial or trials interchangeability requires that a biological product be biosimilar to the reference product and that the product can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and for products administered multiple times to an individual that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch 

a reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product and the fda will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product ‘‘first licensure’’ typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the united states date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of and a new period of exclusivity is not available for a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product or licensor predecessor in interest or other related entity for a change not including a modification to the structure of the biological product that results in a new indication route of administration dosing schedule dosage form delivery system delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety purity or potency 

pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the united states pediatric exclusivity if granted adds six months to existing regulatory exclusivity periods this six month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an fda issued ‘‘written request’’ for such a trial 

european union drug development 

in the eu our future products also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements as in the united states medicinal products can be marketed only if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained 

similar to the united states the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the european union are subject to significant regulatory controls although the eu clinical trials directive 200120ec has sought to harmonize the eu clinical trials regulatory framework setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the eu the eu member states have transposed and applied the provisions of the directive differently this has led to significant variations in the member state regimes under the current regime before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the eu countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies the national competent authority or nca and one or more ethics committees or ecs under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the nca and ecs of the member state where they occurred 

the eu clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical trial authorization simplifying adverse event reporting procedures improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency recently enacted clinical trials regulation eu no 5362014 ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the eu will be identical 

pediatric investigation plan 

an application for marketing authorization of a medicinal product for human use which is not yet authorized in the european union shall be considered valid only if it includes a pediatric investigational plan or pip according to regulation ec no 19012006 the pip or the application for waiver shall be submitted with a request for agreement except in duly justified cases early during the product development phase and not later than upon completion of the human pharmacokinetic studies in healthy subjects the end of phase 1 pharmacokinetic studies can coincide with the initial tolerability studies or the initiation of the adult phase 2 studies proofofconcept studies in any case submission of the pip cannot be after initiation of pivotal trials or confirmatory phase 3 trials 

the pediatric committee a scientific committee established at the community level shall assess the content of any pip waivers and deferrals for a medicinal product submitted to it in accordance with the regulation on medicinal products for pediatric use and formulate an opinion thereon 

european union drug review and approval 

in the european economic area or eea which is comprised of the 28 member states of the eu and norway iceland and liechtenstein medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a marketing authorization or ma there are two types of marketing authorizations 

the community ma is issued by the european commission through the centralized procedure based on the opinion of the committee for medicinal products for human use or chmp of the ema and is valid throughout the entire territory of the eea the centralized procedure is mandatory for certain types of products such as biotechnology medicinal products orphan medicinal products advanced therapy medicines such as gene therapy somatic cell therapy or tissue engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of hiv aids cancer neurodegenerative disorders diabetes autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases the centralized procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the eea or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the eu 

national mas which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the eea and only cover their respective territory are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the eea this national ma can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure if the product has not received a national ma in any member state at the time of application it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the member states in which the ma is sought one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state or rms the competent authority of the rms prepares a draft assessment report a draft summary of the product characteristics or spc and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet which are sent to the other member states referred to as the member states concerned for their approval if the member states concerned raise no objections based on a potential serious risk to public health to the assessment spc labeling or packaging proposed by the rms the product is subsequently granted a national ma in all the member states ie in the rms and the member states concerned 

under the above described procedures before granting the ma the ema or the competent authorities of the member states of the eea make an assessment of the risk benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality safety and efficacy 

european union exclusivity 

in the eu new products authorized for marketing ie reference products qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization the data exclusivity if granted prevents regulatory authorities in the eu from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application for eight years after which a generic or biosimilar marketing application can be submitted and the innovator’s data may be referenced but not approved for two years the overall 10year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if during the first eight years of those 10 years the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with currently approved therapies 

european union orphan designation and exclusivity 

in the eu the ema’s committee for orphan medicinal products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis prevention or treatment of life threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10000 persons in the eu community or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis prevention or treatment has been authorized or if a method exists the product would be a significant benefit to those affected 

in the eu orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and 10 years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval this period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process 

european data collection 

the collection and use of personal health data in the european union is governed by the provisions of the data protection directive and as of may 2018 the general data protection regulation or gdpr this directive imposes several requirements relating to the 

consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates the information provided to the individuals notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities and the security and confidentiality of the personal data the data protection directive and gdpr also impose strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu to the united states failure to comply with the requirements of the data protection directive the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the eu member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties the gdpr introduces new data protection requirements in the eu and substantial fines for breaches of the data protection rules the gdpr regulations may impose additional responsibility and liability in relation to personal data that we process and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules this may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

european union drug marketing 

much like the antikickback statute prohibition in the united states the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is also prohibited in the eu the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is governed by the national antibribery laws of european union member states such as the uk bribery act 2010 infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment 

payments made to physicians in certain eu member states must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization andor the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

rest of the world regulation 

for other countries outside of the eu and the united states such as countries in eastern europe latin america middle east or asia the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials product licensing pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country additionally the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with gcp requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the declaration of helsinki 

if we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements we may be subject to among other things fines suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals product recalls seizure of products operating restrictions or criminal prosecution 

other healthcare laws 

healthcare providers physicians and third party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval our future arrangements with third party payors healthcare providers and physicians may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market sell and distribute any drugs for which we obtain marketing approval in the united states these laws include without limitation state and federal antikickback false claims physician transparency and patient data privacy and security laws and regulations including but not limited to those described below 



 the scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers which has led to a number of investigations prosecutions convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry it is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations if our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other related governmental regulations that may apply to us we may be subject to significant civil criminal and administrative penalties damages fines imprisonment disgorgement exclusion of drugs from government funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid reputational harm additional oversight and reporting obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar settlement to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations if any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws they may be subject to similar actions penalties and sanctions ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities can be time and resourceconsuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business 

current and future healthcare reform legislation 

in the united states and foreign jurisdictions there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any investigational medicines for which we obtain marketing approval we expect that current laws as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we or any strategic collaborators may receive for any approved products 

the aca for example contains provisions that subject biological products to potential competition by lowercost biosimilars and may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by medicaid programs extension of medicaid rebates to medicaid managed care plans mandatory discounts for certain medicare part d beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs with the current presidential administration and congress there may be additional administrative or legislative changes including modification repeal or replacement of all or certain provisions of the aca which may impact reimbursement for drugs and biologics on january 20 2017 an executive order was signed directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the aca to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision of the aca that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states individuals 

healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices on october 13 2017 an executive order was signed terminating the costsharing subsidies that reimburse insurers under the aca several state attorneys general filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in california on october 25 2017 the loss of the cost share reduction payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the aca further on june 14 2018 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than 12 billion in aca risk corridor payments to thirdparty payors who argued were owed to them the effects of this gap in reimbursement on thirdparty payors the viability of the aca marketplace and providers are not yet known 

in addition the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the aca for plans sold through such marketplaces further each chamber of congress has put forth multiple bills this year designed to repeal or repeal and replace portions of the aca while congress has not passed repeal legislation the tax reform act includes a provision repealing effective january 1 2019 the taxbased shared responsibility payment imposed by the aca on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” congress may consider other legislation to repeal and replace elements of the aca litigation and legislation over the aca are likely to continue with unpredictable and uncertain results 

additionally other federal health reform measures have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted 

 further there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products which have resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to among other things bring more transparency to product pricing review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products in addition the federal government state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs including pricecontrols restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs for example the federal government has passed legislation requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide rebates and discounts to certain entities and governmental payors to participate in federal healthcare programs additionally the current administration released a “blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase manufacturer competition increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers while any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective congress and the administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative andor administrative measures to control drug costs 

individual states in the united states have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and in some cases designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

packaging and distribution in the united states 

if our products are made available to authorized users of the federal supply schedule of the general services administration additional laws and requirements apply products must meet applicable childresistant packaging requirements under the us poison prevention packaging act manufacturing sales promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws 

the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations including extensive recordkeeping licensing storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products 

the failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action depending on the circumstances failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution fines or other 

penalties injunctions exclusion from federal healthcare programs requests for recall seizure of products total or partial suspension of production denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts including government contracts any action against us for violation of these laws even if we successfully defend against it could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way 

changes in regulations statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring for example i changes to our manufacturing arrangements ii additions or modifications to product labeling iii the recall or discontinuation of our products or iv additional recordkeeping requirements if any such changes were to be imposed they could adversely affect the operation of our business 

other us environmental health and safety laws and regulations 

we may be subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes from time to time and in the future our operations may involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials and may also produce hazardous waste products even if we contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and waste products we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from the use or disposal of our hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees but this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities however we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us 

in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts in addition failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions

risks related to our business and creating a new class of medicines 

we will need to seek and secure significant funding through financings or from other sources clinical data or trial execution that creates delays setbacks or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities or the entire pipeline could result in an impaired ability or inability to finance or fund the company in the future 

we are currently advancing our pipeline of 20  programs in development 11  of which are in clinical studies discovering development candidates and developing investigational medicines is expensive and we expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to i perform basic research perform preclinical studies and conduct clinical trials of our current and future programs ii continue to develop and expand our platform and infrastructure and supply preclinical studies and clinical trials with appropriate grade materials including current good manufacturing practices or cgmp materials iii seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines and iv launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval including building our own commercial sales marketing and distribution organization 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 17 billion  in cash cash equivalents and investments we expect that our existing cash cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations through at least the next twelve months however our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned through public or private equity or debt financings government or other thirdparty funding sales of assets marketing and distribution arrangements other collaborations and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches in any event we will require additional capital to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our investigational medicines even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans we may seek additional capital if market conditions are favorable or if we have specific strategic considerations our spending will vary based on new and ongoing development and corporate activities because the length of time and activities associated with discovery of development candidates and development of our investigational medicines are highly uncertain we are unable to estimate the actual funds we will require for development marketing and commercialization activities our future funding requirements both near and long term will depend on many factors including but not limited to 



 to date we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and revenue from strategic alliances and we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on favorable terms or at all until we can generate sufficient product or royalty revenue to finance our operations which we may never do we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings debt financings collaborations strategic alliances sales of assets licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements any fundraising efforts may divert our management from their daytoday activities which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our investigational medicines in addition we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts at the right time on favorable terms or at all negative clinical trial data or setbacks or perceived setbacks in our programs or with respect to our technology could impair our ability to raise additional financing on favorable terms or at all moreover the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders and the issuance of additional securities whether equity or debt by us or the possibility of such issuance may cause the market price of our shares to decline if we raise additional funds through public or private equity offerings the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that may adversely affect our stockholders’ rights 

further to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock your ownership interest will be diluted if we raise additional capital through debt financing we would be subject to fixed payment obligations and may be subject to covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions such as incurring additional debt making capital expenditures or declaring dividends if we raise additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements sales of assets or other collaborations strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish certain valuable rights to our development candidates and investigational medicines technologies future revenue streams or research programs we also could be required to seek strategic collaborators for one or more of our current or future investigational medicines at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable or relinquish our rights to development candidates investigational medicines or ip that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts at the right time on favorable terms or at all we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our products or investigational medicines or one or more of our other research and development initiatives any of the above events could significantly harm our business prospects financial condition and results of operations cause the price of our common stock to decline and negatively impact our ability to fund operations 

we attempt to distribute our technology biology execution and financing risks across a wide variety of therapeutic areas disease states programs and technologies however our assessment of and approach to risk may not be comprehensive or effectively avoid delays or failures in one or more of our programs or modalities failures in one or more of our programs or modalities could adversely impact other programs or modalities in our pipeline and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations and ability to fund our business 

we are creating a new class of medicines based on mrna to improve the lives of patients from the beginning we designed our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mrna over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases we have made investments in our platform infrastructure and clinical capabilities that have enabled us to establish a pipeline of 20  programs in development 11  of which are in clinical studies as our development candidates and investigational medicines progress we or others may determine that certain of our risk allocation decisions were incorrect or insufficient that we made platform level technology mistakes that individual programs or our mrna science in general has technology or biology risks that were unknown or underappreciated that our choices on how to develop our infrastructure to support our scale will result in an inability to manufacture our investigational medicines for clinical trials or otherwise impair our manufacturing or that we have allocated resources in such a way that large investments are not recovered and capital allocation is not subject to rapid redirection all of these risks may relate to our current and future programs sharing similar science including mrna science and infrastructure and in the event material decisions in any of these areas turn out to have been incorrect or underoptimized we may experience a material adverse impact on our business and ability to fund our operations and we may never realize what we believe is the potential of mrna 

no mrna drug has been approved in this new potential class of medicines and may never be approved as a result of efforts by others or us mrna drug development has substantial clinical development and regulatory risks due to the novel and unprecedented nature of this new class of medicines 

as a potential new class of medicines no mrna medicines have been approved to date by the fda or other regulatory agency successful discovery and development of mrna medicines by either us or our strategic collaborators is highly uncertain and depends on numerous factors many of which are beyond our or their control we have made and will continue to make a series of business decisions and take calculated risks to advance our development efforts and pipeline including those related to mrna technology delivery technology and manufacturing processes which may be shown to be incorrect based on further work by us our strategic collaborators or others to date there has never been a phase 3 trial or a commercialized product in which mrna is the primary 

active ingredient our mrna medicines that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to advance experience delays in the clinic experience clinical holds or fail to reach the market for many reasons including 

 currently mrna is considered a gene therapy product by the fda unlike certain gene therapies that irreversibly alter cell dna and could act as a source of side effects mrna based medicines are designed to not irreversibly change cell dna however side effects observed in gene therapy could negatively impact the perception of mrna medicines despite the differences in mechanism in addition because no product in which mrna is the primary active ingredient has been approved the regulatory pathway for approval is uncertain the number and design of the clinical and preclinical studies required for the approval of these types of medicines have not been established may be different from those required for gene therapy products or may require safety testing like gene therapy products moreover the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an application for marketing approval for a final decision by a regulatory authority varies significantly from one pharmaceutical product to the next and may be difficult to predict 

we have incurred significant losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future 

we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 2009 including net losses of 3847 million  2559 million  and 2162 million  for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively as of december 31 2018  we had an accumulated deficit of 10 billion   

we have devoted most of our financial resources to research and development including our clinical and preclinical development activities and the development of our platform to date we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and proceeds from strategic alliances and to a lesser extent through grants from governmental and private organizations the amount of our future net losses will depend in part on the rate of our future expenditures and our ability to obtain funding through equity or debt financings sales of assets strategic alliances or additional grants we have not commenced or completed pivotal clinical studies for any of our programs in clinical trials or investigational medicines and it will be several years if ever before we or our strategic collaborators have an investigational medicine ready for commercialization even if we obtain regulatory approval to market an 

investigational medicine our future revenues will depend upon the size of any markets in which our investigational medicines have received approval and our ability to achieve sufficient market acceptance reimbursement from thirdparty payors and adequate market share in those markets we may never achieve profitability 

we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future we anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we 

 our quarterly and annual operating results may fluctuate in the future as a result we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of research analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline and negatively impact our financing or funding ability as well as negatively impact our ability to exist as a standalone company 

our financial condition and operating results have varied in the past and will continue to fluctuate from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear in the future due to a variety of factors many of which are beyond our control factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following as well as other factors described elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k 



 due to the various factors mentioned herein and others the results of any of our prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future operating performance 

the net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quartertoquarter and yeartoyear such that a periodtoperiod comparison of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance in any particular quarter or quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors which could cause our stock price to decline while as a general matter we intend to periodically report on the status of our development programs including articulating anticipated next steps in the form of development plans or potential data readouts we do not currently plan to provide forwardlooking guidance on the timing of those next steps in addition we do not control the timing of disclosure of any such milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators any disclosure by our strategic collaborators or competitors of data or other events that are perceived as negative whether or not such data are related to other data that we or others release may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or overall valuation our stock price may decline as a result of unexpected clinical trial results in one or more of our programs including adverse safety events reported for any of our programs 

our business is highly dependent on the clinical advancement of our programs and modalities delay or failure to advance programs or modalities could adversely impact our business 

using our platform we are developing product features for medicines based on mrna over time our platform work led to commonalities where a specific combination of mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes generated a set of product features shared by multiple programs this is what we call a “ modality ” we have historically utilized and expect to continue to utilize earlier programs in a modality to understand the technology risks within the modality including manufacturing and pharmaceutical properties even if our earlier programs in a modality are successful in any phase of development any of such earlier programs may fail at a later phase of development and other programs within the same modality may still fail at any phase of development including at phases where earlier programs in that modality were successful this may be a result of technical challenges unique to that program or due to biology risk which is unique to every program as we progress our programs through clinical development there may be new technical challenges that arise that cause an entire modality to fail 

while we aim to segregate risk using modalities there may be foreseen and unforeseen risks across modalities in whole or in part these include but are not limited to mrna chemical modifications and lnps and their components in addition if any one or more 

of our clinical programs encounter safety tolerability or efficacy problems developmental delays regulatory issues or other problems our platform approach and business could be significantly harmed 

in addition the biology risk across the majority of our pipeline represents targets and pathways not clinically validated by one or more approved drugs while we believe we have made progress in seeking to reduce biology risk in certain settings such as for vaccine targets for which we and others have shown the utility of neutralizing antibodies the risk that the targets or pathways that we have selected may not be effective will continue to apply across the majority of our current and future programs 

while we attempt to diversify our risks by developing one or more programs in each modality there are risks that are unique to each modality and risks that are applicable across modalities these risks may impair our ability to advance one or more of our programs in clinical development obtain regulatory approval or ultimately commercialize our programs or cause us to experience significant delays in doing so any of which may materially harm our business 

certain features in our development candidates and investigational medicines including those related to mrna chemical modifications surface chemistries lnps and their components may result in foreseen and unforeseen risks that are active across some or all of our modalities any such portfolio spanning risks whether known or unknown if realized in any one of our programs would have a material and adverse effect on our other programs and on our business as a whole 

there are specific additional risks to certain of our modalities and our programs as a whole for example prophylactic vaccines typically require clinical testing in thousands to tens of thousands of healthy volunteers to define an approvable benefitrisk profile the need to show a high degree of safety and tolerability when dosing healthy individuals could result in rare and even spurious safety findings negatively impacting a program prior to or after commercial launch while we believe that certain safety tolerability and levels of immunogenicity we have observed in the earlystage clinical trials in our prophylactic vaccine programs is sufficient to initiate additional trials there can be no assurance that we will observe acceptable safety or efficacy profiles in laterstage trials required for approval of these programs for neoantigen cancer vaccines to date no molecular noncellbased therapeutic protein vaccine has been shown to be effective against cancer and there are many clinical and manufacturing challenges to personalized medicines including cellbased therapies and vaccines these risks include a rapid production turnaround time that is measured in weeks in order to supply patients in our clinical trials before further progression and mutation of their tumors the significant costs incurred in making individualized vaccines and potential lack of immune responses potentially due to the biology of the tumor or immune status of the patient these and other risks apply to our personalized cancer vaccine or pcv and other neoepitope investigational medicine programs additionally there may be challenges in delivering an adequate quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient or api required to drive efficacy due to the limitation in volume of api that can be delivered to a specific location like a tumor or injured tissue our therapies for local injections often require specialized skills for conducting a clinical trial that could delay trials or slow or impair commercialization of an approved investigational medicine due to the poor adoption of injected local therapeutics or intratumoral therapies in addition the uncertain translatability of target selection from preclinical animal models including mouse and nonhuman primate models to successful clinical trial results may be impossible particularly for immunooncology and systemic therapies and cancer vaccines in general several biological steps are required for delivery of mrna to translate into therapeutically active medicines these processing steps may differ between individuals or tissues and this could lead to variable levels of therapeutic protein variable activity immunogenicity or variable distribution to tissues for a therapeutic effect gene therapies and mrna based medicines may activate one or more immune responses against any and all components of the drug product eg the mrna or the delivery vehicle such as a lipid nanoparticle as well as against the encoded protein giving rise to potential immune reaction related adverse events eliciting an immune response against the encoded protein may impede our ability to achieve a pharmacologic effect upon repeat administration or a sideeffect these risks apply to all of our programs including our systemic secreted therapeutics and systemic intracellular therapeutics modalities 

risks related to the research development regulatory review and approval of our existing and future pipeline 

preclinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially for a new class of medicines such as mrna and therefore our preclinical programs or development candidates may be delayed terminated or may never advance to the clinic any of which may affect our ability to obtain funding and may have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

much of our pipeline is in preclinical development and these programs could be delayed or not advance into the clinic before we can initiate clinical trials for a development candidate we must complete extensive preclinical studies including indenabling glp toxicology testing that support our planned investigational new drug applications or inds in the united states or similar applications in other jurisdictions we must also complete extensive work on chemistry manufacturing and controls or cmc activities including yield purity and stability data to be included in the ind filing cmc activities for a new class of medicines such as mrna require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our preclinical or clinical development candidates if we are required to produce new batches of our development candidates due to insufficient shelf life it may delay the commencement or completion of preclinical studies or clinical trials of such development candidates for example we cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies and cannot predict if the fda 

or other regulatory authorities will accept the results of our preclinical testing or our proposed clinical programs or if the outcome of our preclinical testing studies and cmc activities will ultimately support the further development of our programs as a result we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit inds or similar applications for our preclinical programs on the timelines we expect if at all and we cannot be sure that submission of inds or similar applications will result in the fda or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin 

clinical development is lengthy and uncertain especially with a new class of medicines such as mrna medicines clinical trials of our investigational medicines may be delayed and certain programs may never advance in the clinic or may be more costly to conduct than we anticipate any of which can affect our ability to fund the company and would have a material adverse impact on our platform or our business 

clinical testing is expensive and complex and can take many years to complete and its outcome is inherently uncertain we may not be able to initiate may experience delays in or may have to discontinue clinical trials for our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators also may experience numerous unforeseen events during or as a result of any clinical trials that we or our strategic collaborators conduct that could delay or prevent us or our strategic collaborators from successfully developing our investigational medicines including 



 we could also encounter delays if a clinical trial is suspended or terminated by us the fda or other regulatory authorities ethics committees or the irbs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted or if such trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the data safety monitoring board or dsmb for such trial we have in the past and may in the future be delayed in gaining clearance from the fda or other regulators to initiate clinical trials through the imposition of a clinical hold in order to address comments from such regulators on our clinical trial design or other elements of our clinical trials the clinical trials of other companies working on mrna medicines have been put on clinical hold by the fda a suspension or termination may be imposed due to a number of factors including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the fda or other regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects including those experienced by other investigational medicines in the same class as our investigational medicines failure to demonstrate a benefit or adequate benefit risk ratio from using an investigational medicine failure to establish or achieve clinically meaningful trial endpoints changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial many of the factors that cause or lead to a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our investigational medicines we must also complete extensive cmc activities that require extensive manufacturing processes and analytical development which is uncertain and lengthy for instance batch failures as we scale up our manufacturing have occurred and may continue to occur in addition we have in the past and may in the future have difficulty identifying appropriate buffers and storage conditions to enable sufficient shelf life of batches of our clinical development candidates or investigational medicines if we are required to produce new batches of our development candidates or investigational medicines due to insufficient shelf life it may delay the commencement or completion of clinical trials of such development candidates or investigational medicines 

moreover the fda has indicated that prior to commencing later stage clinical trials for our programs we will need to develop assays to measure and predict the potency of a given dose of our investigational medicines any delay in developing assays that are acceptable to the fda or other regulators could delay the start of future clinical trials further the fda or other regulatory authorities may disagree with our clinical trial design and our interpretation of data for our clinical trials or may change the requirements for approval even after they have reviewed and commented on the design for our clinical trials 

significant preclinical or nonclinical testing and studies or clinical trial delays for our investigational medicines also could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do potentially impairing our ability to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines and harming our business and results of operations any delays in the development of our investigational medicines may harm our business financial condition and prospects significantly 

mrna medicines are a novel approach and negative perception of the efficacy safety or tolerability of any investigational medicines that we develop could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business advance our investigational medicines or obtain regulatory approvals 

as a potential new class of medicines no mrna medicines have been approved to date by the fda or other regulators adverse events in clinical trials of our investigational medicines or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity as well as any other adverse events in the field of mrna medicine or other products that are perceived to be similar to mrna medicines such as those related to gene therapy or gene editing could result in a decrease in the perceived benefit of one or more of our programs increased regulatory scrutiny decreased confidence by patients and clinical trial collaborators in our investigational medicines and less demand for any product that we may develop our large pipeline of development candidates and 

investigational medicines could result in a greater quantity of reportable adverse events including suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions or susars other reportable negative clinical outcomes manufacturing reportable events or material clinical events that could lead to clinical delay or hold by the fda or applicable regulatory authority or other clinical delays any of which could negatively impact the perception of one or more of our programs as well as our business as a whole in addition responses by us state or foreign governments to negative public perception may result in new legislation or regulations that could limit our ability to develop any investigational medicines or commercialize any approved products obtain or maintain regulatory approval or otherwise achieve profitability more restrictive statutory regimes government regulations or negative public opinion would have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and may delay or impair the development of our investigational medicines and commercialization of any approved products or demand for any products we may develop 

because we are developing some of our development candidates or investigational medicines for the treatment of diseases in which there is little clinical experience and in some cases using new endpoints or methodologies the fda or other regulatory authorities may not consider the endpoints of our clinical trials to provide clinically meaningful results 

there are no pharmacologic therapies approved to treat the underlying causes of many diseases that we currently attempt to address or may address in the future for instance for methylmalonic acidemia or mma or propionic acidemia or pa few clinical trials have been attempted in addition there has been limited clinical trial experience for the development of pharmaceuticals to treat these rare diseases in general and we are not aware of a registrational trial that led to approval of a drug to treat these diseases there have been some historical trials with other agents to address organic acidemias which may have utilized clinical endpoints that are less applicable to our efforts with our mma and pa programs that address the underlying defect as a result the design and conduct of clinical trials of investigational medicines for the treatment of these disorders and other disorders may take longer be more costly or be less effective as part of the novelty of development in these diseases 

even if the fda does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful we may not achieve the prespecified endpoint to a degree of statistical significance in any pivotal or other clinical trials we or our strategic collaborators may conduct for our programs further even if we do achieve the prespecified criteria our trials may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with the results of the more traditional efficacy endpoints in the trial the fda also could give overriding weight to other efficacy endpoints over a primary endpoint even if we achieve statistically significant results on that endpoint if we do not do so on our secondary efficacy endpoints the fda also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks and the fda may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of licensure other regulatory authorities in europe and other countries may make similar findings with respect to these endpoints 

some of our investigational medicines are classified as gene therapies by the fda and the ema and the fda has indicated that our investigational medicines will be reviewed within its center for biologics evaluation and research or cber even though our mrna investigational medicines are designed to have a different mechanism of action from gene therapies the association of our investigational medicines with gene therapies could result in increased regulatory burdens impair the reputation of our investigational medicines or negatively impact our platform or our business 

there have been few approvals of gene therapy products in the united states or foreign jurisdictions and there have been wellreported significant adverse events associated with their testing and use gene therapy products have the effect of introducing new dna and potentially irreversibly changing the dna in a cell in contrast mrna is highly unlikely to localize to the nucleus integrate into the dna or otherwise make any permanent changes to cell dna consequently we expect that our investigational medicines will have a different potential side effect profile from gene therapies 

regulatory requirements governing gene and cell therapy products have evolved and may continue to change in the future and the implications for mrnabased therapies is unknown for example the fda has established the office of tissues and advanced therapies within cber to consolidate the review of gene therapy and related products and convenes the cellular tissue and gene therapies advisory committee to advise cber on its review in the eu mrna has been characterized as a gene therapy medicinal product in certain countries mrna therapies have not yet been classified or any such classification is not known to us specifically in japan the pmda has not taken a position on the regulatory classification notwithstanding the differences between our mrna investigational medicines and gene therapies the classification of some of our mrna investigational medicines as gene therapies in the united states the eu and potentially other counties could adversely impact our ability to develop our investigational medicines and could negatively impact our platform and our business for instance a clinical hold on gene therapy products across the field due to risks associated with altering cell dna irreversibly may apply to our mrna investigational medicines irrespective of the mechanistic differences between gene therapies and mrna 

adverse events reported with respect to gene therapies or genome editing therapies could adversely impact one or more of our programs although our mrna development candidates and investigational medicines are designed not to make any permanent changes to cell dna regulatory agencies or others could believe that adverse effects of gene therapies products caused by introducing new dna and irreversibly changing the dna in a cell could also be a risk for our mrna investigational therapies and as a result may delay one or more of our trials or impose additional testing for longterm side effects any new requirements and guidelines promulgated by regulatory review agencies may have a negative effect on our business by lengthening the regulatory review process 

requiring us to perform additional or larger studies or increasing our development costs any of which could lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations delay or prevent advancement or approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines or lead to significant postapproval studies limitations or restrictions as we advance our investigational medicines we will be required to consult with these regulatory agencies and advisory committees and comply with applicable requirements and guidelines if we fail to do so we may be required to delay or discontinue development of some or all of our investigational medicines 

a breakthrough therapy designation or fast track designation by the fda for a drug may not lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process and it would not increase the likelihood that the drug will receive marketing approval 

we may seek a breakthrough therapy designation for one or more of our investigational medicines a breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs to treat a serious or lifethreatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development for drugs that have been designated as breakthrough therapies interaction and communication between the fda and the sponsor of the trial can help to identify the most efficient path for clinical development while minimizing the number of patients placed in ineffective control regimens drugs designated as breakthrough therapies by the fda are also eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of the submission of the bla 

designation as a breakthrough therapy is at the discretion of the fda accordingly even if we believe that one of our investigational medicines meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy the fda may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation in any event the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a drug may not result in a faster development process review or approval compared to drugs considered for approval under conventional fda procedures and it would not assure ultimate approval by the fda in addition even if one or more of our investigational medicines qualify as breakthrough therapies the fda may later decide that the investigational medicine no longer meets the conditions for qualification or it may decide that the time period for fda review or approval will not be shortened 

we may seek fast track designation for some of our investigational medicines if a therapy is intended for the treatment of a serious or lifethreatening condition and the therapy demonstrates the potential to address significant unmet medical needs for this condition the drug sponsor may apply for fast track designation the fda has broad discretion whether or not to grant this designation and even if we believe a particular investigational medicine is eligible for this designation we cannot assure you that the fda would decide to grant it even if we do receive fast track designation we may not experience a faster development process review or approval compared to conventional fda procedures the fda may withdraw fast track designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from our clinical development program fast track designation alone does not guarantee qualification for the fda’s priority review procedures 

we may experience delays in identifying and enrolling participants in our clinical trials which would delay the progress of our investigational medicines and result in increased expenses 

we depend on enrollment of participants in our clinical trials for our investigational medicines we may find it difficult to enroll trial participants in our clinical studies which could delay or prevent clinical studies of our investigational medicines identifying and qualifying trial participants to participate in clinical studies of our investigational medicines is critical to our success the timing of our clinical studies depends on the speed at which we can recruit trial participants to participate in testing our investigational medicines delays in enrollment may result in increased costs or may affect the timing or outcome of the planned clinical trials which could prevent completion of these trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of our investigational medicines if trial participants are unwilling to participate in our studies because of negative publicity from adverse events in our trials or other trials of similar products or those related to specific therapeutic area or for other reasons including competitive clinical studies for similar patient populations the timeline for recruiting trial participants conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of potential products may be delayed these delays could result in increased costs delays in advancing our product development delays in testing the effectiveness of our product or termination of the clinical studies altogether 

we may not be able to identify recruit and enroll a sufficient number of trial participants or those with required or desired characteristics to achieve diversity in a study to complete our clinical studies in a timely manner patient and subject enrollment is affected by factors including 



 in addition our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for investigational medicines that are in the same therapeutic areas as our investigational medicines and this competition will reduce the number and types of trial participants available to us because some trial participants who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by a third party since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use which will reduce the number of trial participants who are available for our clinical trials at such clinical trial sites moreover because in some cases our investigational medicines represent a departure from more traditional methods for disease treatment and prevention potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies or other new therapies rather than enroll trial participants in any future clinical trial involving mrna investigational medicines additionally if new investigational medicines such as gene editing therapies show encouraging results potential trial participants and their doctors may be inclined to enroll trial participants in clinical trials using those investigational medicines if such new investigational medicines show discouraging results or other adverse safety indications potential trial participants and their doctors may be less inclined to enroll trial participants in our clinical trials we also have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators control the development of certain of our investigational medicines which may provide us limited or no ability to influence the enrollment rate of our clinical trials 

we may fail to obtain and maintain orphan drug designations from the fda for our future investigational medicines as applicable 

our strategy includes filing for orphan drug designation where available for our investigational medicines and we have received orphan drug designation from the fda for mma mrna3704 and pa mrna3927 under the orphan drug act the fda may grant orphan drug designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition which is defined as one occurring in a patient population of fewer than 200000 in the united states or a patient population greater than 200000 in the united states where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug or biologic will be recovered from sales in the united states in the united states orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs tax advantages and userfee waivers however orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process if a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the disease for which it has such designation the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity which means that the fda may not approve any other applications including a full new drug application or nda or bla to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years except in limited circumstances such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity or where the original manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity 

in addition exclusive marketing rights in the united states may be limited if we seek approval for an indication broader than the orphandesignated indication or may be lost if the fda later determines that the request for designation was materially defective further even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product from competition because different drugs with different active moieties may receive and be approved for the same condition and only the first applicant to receive approval will receive the benefits of marketing exclusivity even after an orphandesignated product is approved the fda can subsequently approve a later drug with the same active moiety for the same condition if the fda concludes that the later drug is clinically superior if it is shown to be safer more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care in addition while we may seek additional orphan drug designation for our investigational medicines we may never receive such further designations 

our investigational medicines may face competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway 

the patient protection and affordable care act as amended by the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 or collectively the aca includes a subtitle called the biologics price competition and innovation act of 2009 or bpcia which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an fdaapproved reference biological product under the bpcia an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the fda until four years following the date that the reference product was first approved by the fda in addition the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the fda until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first approved during this 12year period of exclusivity another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the fda approves a bla for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and wellcontrolled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety purity and potency of the other company’s product the law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the fda as a result its ultimate impact implementation and meaning are subject to uncertainty 

we believe that any of our investigational medicines approved as a biological product under a bla should qualify for the 12year period of exclusivity however there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise or that the fda will not consider our investigational medicines to be reference products for competing products potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated other aspects of the bpcia some of which may impact the bpcia exclusivity provisions have also been the subject of recent litigation moreover the extent to which a biosimilar once approved will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for nonbiological products is not yet clear and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing 

any clinical trials of our oncologyrelated products that we conduct with a seamless trial design may not be acceptable to regulatory authorities in the form submitted or at all which may delay our clinical development and limit or change the type of information we may gather from our clinical trials 

we may pursue a development program for our oncologyrelated products that relies upon a seamless trial design which presents additional risks compared to traditional threephase development programs a seamless trial design can be achieved through a firstinhuman or fih multiple expansion cohort trial which has a single protocol with an initial doseescalation phase and also contains three or more additional patient cohorts with cohortspecific objectives fih multiple expansion cohort trials are intended to expedite development by seamlessly proceeding from initial determination of a potential effective dose to individual cohorts that have trial objectives typical of phase 2 trials challenges and risks associated with such seamless trial designs include challenges in the timely dissemination of new safety information to investigators irbs and regulators exposing a large number of patients across cohorts to potentially suboptimal or toxic doses of an investigational drug exposing more patients than is needed to achieve the cohort’s objectives and missed interpretations of preliminary trial results and unplanned analyses which can lead to delays in clinical development regulatory authorities may find our seamless trial designs unacceptable based on these and other risks of utilizing such designs 

if we are not able to obtain or if there are delays in obtaining required regulatory approvals we will not be able to commercialize or will be delayed in commercializing investigational medicines we may develop and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired 

even if we complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials the marketing approval process is expensive timeconsuming and uncertain and may prevent us from obtaining approvals for the commercialization of any development candidates and investigational medicines we may develop any mrna medicine we may develop and the activities associated with its development and commercialization including design testing manufacture recordkeeping labeling storage approval advertising promotion sale and distribution are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and by comparable global health authorities to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to commercialize any of our investigational medicines we and our strategic collaborators must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe pure and potent or effective in humans including the target population successful completion of clinical trials is a prerequisite to submitting a bla to the fda a marketing authorization application or maa to the ema and similar marketing applications to comparable global regulatory authorities for each investigational medicine and consequently the ultimate approval and commercial marketing of any investigational medicines 

failure to obtain marketing approval for an investigational medicine will prevent us from commercializing the investigational medicine in a given jurisdiction we have not received approval to market any investigational medicines from regulatory authorities in any jurisdiction and it is possible that none of our investigational medicines or any investigational medicines we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain regulatory approval we have limited experience in filing and supporting the applications necessary to gain marketing approvals and may need to rely on thirdparty contract research organizations or cros or regulatory consultants to assist us in this process to our knowledge there is no current precedent for an mrna based medicine such as the types we are developing being approved for sale by the fda or any other global regulatory agency although we expect to submit blas for our mrna based investigational medicines in the united states other jurisdictions may consider our mrna based investigational medicines to be new drugs not biologics and require different marketing applications securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data and supporting information to the various regulatory authorities for each 

therapeutic indication to establish the investigational medicine’s safety and efficacy securing regulatory approval also requires the submission of information about the product manufacturing process to and inspection of manufacturing facilities by the relevant regulatory authority any investigational medicines we develop may not be effective may be only moderately effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude our obtaining marketing approval or prevent or limit commercial use 

the process of obtaining marketing approvals both in the united states and abroad is expensive may take many years if additional clinical trials are required if approval is obtained at all and can vary substantially based upon a variety of factors including the type complexity and novelty of the investigational medicines involved changes in marketing approval policies during the development period changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application the fda and comparable authorities in other countries have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data are insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical clinical or other studies in addition varying interpretations of the data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing could delay limit or prevent marketing approval of an investigational medicine any marketing approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or postapproval commitments that render the approved product not commercially viable additional delays or nonapproval may result if an fda advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends nonapproval or restrictions on approval in addition we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in regulatory agency policy during the period of product development clinical studies and the review process 

regulatory agencies also may approve an mrna medicine for fewer or more limited indications than requested or may grant approval subject to the performance of postmarketing studies in addition regulatory agencies may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of our treatment candidates 

the fda and other regulatory agencies review the cmc section of regulatory filings any aspects found unsatisfactory by regulatory agencies may result in delays in clinical trials and commercialization in addition the regulatory agencies conduct preapproval inspections or pais at the time of a bla any findings by regulatory agencies and failure to comply with requirements may lead to delay in approval and failure to commercial the potential mrna investigational medicine 

if we experience delays in obtaining approval or if we fail to obtain approval of any investigational medicines we may develop the commercial prospects for those investigational medicines will be harmed and our ability to generate revenues will be materially impaired 

we may never obtain ema or other foreign regulatory body approval for any of our investigational medicines and even if we do we may never be able to commercialize any of our investigational medicines in any other jurisdiction which would limit our ability to realize their full market potential 

approval by the fda in the united states if obtained does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions in order to eventually market any of our investigational medicines in any particular foreign jurisdiction we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a jurisdictionbyjurisdiction basis regarding safety and efficacy in addition clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country approval processes vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods 

seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and timeconsuming regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries the foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with fda approval we do not have any investigational medicines approved for sale in any jurisdiction including international markets and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our products will be unrealized 

our planned clinical trials or those of our strategic collaborators may reveal significant adverse events not seen in our preclinical or nonclinical studies and may result in a safety profile that could delay or terminate clinical trials or delay or prevent regulatory approval or market acceptance of any of our investigational medicines 

there is typically an extremely high rate of attrition for product candidates across categories of medicines proceeding through clinical trials these product candidates may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile in later stages of clinical trials despite having progressed through nonclinical studies and initial clinical trials a number of companies in the biopharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in laterstage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety profiles notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials most investigational medicines that commence clinical trials are never approved as products and 

there can be no assurance that any of our current or future clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our investigational medicines 

some of our investigational medicines are developed or intended to be coadministered with other developmental therapies or approved medicines for example our pcv investigational medicine mrna4157 and our kras investigational medicine in collaboration with merck  co or merck mrna5671 may be coadministered with merck’s antipd1 therapy pembrolizumab our il12 investigational medicine in collaboration with astrazeneca medi1191 is being developed to be coadministered with checkpoint inhibitors eg antipdl1 antictla4 these combinations may have additional side effects the uncertainty resulting from the use of our investigational medicines in combination with other therapies may make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials 

some of our development candidates and investigational medicines are developed or intended for adolescent andor pediatric patients under the age of eighteen for example we have an open ind for our mma development candidate mrna3704 for a firstinhuman phase 12 study in patients between one and eighteen years of age if successfully dosed this will be the first of our investigational medicines given to subjects eighteen years of age or younger and the first of our investigational medicines from our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality dosed in humans the uncertainty resulting from the first dosing of young human subjects with an investigational medicine from our systemic intracellular therapeutics modality makes it difficult to accurately predict if significant adverse events or other side effects will be observed 

most of our investigational medicines are formulated and administered in an lnp which when administered may lead to systemic side effects related to the components of the lnp some of which may not have been previously tested in humans while we have continued to optimize our lnps there can be no assurance that our lnps will not have undesired effects our lnps could contribute in whole or in part to one or more of the following immune reactions infusion reactions complement reactions opsonization reactions antibody reactions or reactions to peg certain aspects of our investigational medicines may induce immune reactions from either the mrna or the lipid as well as adverse reactions within liver pathways or degradation of the mrna or the lnp any of which could lead to significant adverse events in one or more of our clinical trials many of these types of side effects have been seen for previously developed lnps there may be resulting uncertainty as to the underlying cause of any such adverse event which would make it difficult to accurately predict side effects in future clinical trials and would result in significant delays in our programs 

if significant adverse events or other side effects are observed in any of our current or future clinical trials we may have difficulty recruiting trial participants to any of our clinical trials trial participants may withdraw from trials or we may be required to abandon the trials or our development efforts of one or more development candidates or investigational medicines altogether we the fda or other applicable regulatory authorities or an irb may impose a clinical hold suspend or terminate clinical trials of an investigational medicine at any time for various reasons including a belief that participants in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or adverse side effects some potential therapeutics developed in the biotechnology industry that initially showed therapeutic promise in earlystage trials have later been found to cause side effects that prevented their further development even if the side effects do not preclude the drug from obtaining or maintaining marketing approval unfavorable benefit risk ratio may inhibit market acceptance of the approved product due to its tolerability versus other therapies any of these developments could materially harm our business financial condition and prospects 

even if we obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medicine our products will remain subject to regulatory scrutiny 

even if we obtain regulatory approval in a jurisdiction the applicable regulatory authority may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly postapproval studies or postmarket surveillance for example the holder of an approved bla is obligated to monitor and report adverse events and any failure of a product to meet the specifications in the bla the holder of an approved bla must also submit new or supplemental applications and obtain fda approval for certain changes to the approved product product labeling or manufacturing process advertising and promotional materials must comply with fda rules and are subject to fda review in addition to other potentially applicable federal and state laws 

if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements following approval of any of our investigational medicines a regulatory agency may 



 any government investigation of alleged violations of law could require us to expend significant time and resources in response and could generate negative publicity the occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize any approved products and generate revenues 

if any of our investigational medicines cause undesirable side effects it could delay or prevent their regulatory approval limit the commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences following any potential marketing approval investigational medicines we may develop may be associated with an adverse immune response or other serious adverse events undesirable side effects or unexpected characteristics in addition to serious adverse events or side effects caused by any of our investigational medicines the administration process or related procedures also can cause undesirable side effects if any such events occur the clinical trials of any of our investigational medicines could be suspended or terminated 

if in the future we are unable to demonstrate that such adverse events were caused by factors other than our investigational medicine the fda the ema or other regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of any of our investigational medicines for any or all targeted indications even if we are able to demonstrate that all future serious adverse events are not productrelated such occurrences could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled trial participants to complete the trial moreover if we elect or are required to delay suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any of our investigational medicines the commercial prospects of such investigational medicines may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these investigational medicines may be delayed or eliminated any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop investigational medicines and may harm our business financial condition result of operations and prospects significantly 

additionally if we successfully obtain regulatory approval for an investigational medicine the fda or other regulatory authority could require us to adopt a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy or rems to ensure that the benefits of treatment with such investigational medicine outweigh the risks for each potential patient which may include among other things a medication guide outlining the risks of the product for distribution to patients a communication plan to health care practitioners extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry furthermore if we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any product that we develop several potentially significant negative consequences could result including 

 any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of any products we may identify and develop and could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we are successful in gaining approval for any of our investigational medicines we will continue to face significant regulatory oversight of the manufacturing and distribution of our products product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to payment of user fees and continual review and periodic inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cgmp and adherence to commitments made in the bla if we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured a regulatory agency may impose restrictions relative to that product or the manufacturing facility including requiring recall or withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing 

our ability to generate product revenue is dependent on the success of one or more of our development candidates or investigational medicines each of which is at an earlystage of development and will require significant additional development and clinical testing before we can seek marketing approval and begin commercial sales 

our ability to generate product revenue is highly dependent on our or our strategic collaborators’ ability to develop obtain regulatory approval of and successfully commercialize one or more of our development candidates or investigational medicines our development candidates or investigational medicines are in the early stages of development and will require additional clinical and nonclinical development regulatory review and approval in each jurisdiction in which we intend to market the products in addition substantial investment access to sufficient commercial manufacturing capacity and significant marketing efforts will be required before we can generate any revenue from product sales to date our investigational medicines have been tested in fewer than 1000 

subjects in the aggregate before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of our investigational medicines we must conduct extensive clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the investigational medicines in humans we cannot be certain that any of our investigational medicines will be successful in clinical studies and they may not receive regulatory approval even if they are successful in clinical studies even if approved our investigational medicines also need to demonstrate health economic benefit in order to establish pricing and reimbursement we may also need to conduct additional evaluation of safety and health outcomes in a postapproval setting 

risks related to the manufacturing of our development candidates investigational medicines and our future pipeline 

our mrna development candidates and investigational medicines are based on novel technologies and any development candidates and investigational medicines we develop may be complex and difficult to manufacture we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage supply chain management or shipping if we or any of our thirdparty manufacturers encounter such difficulties our ability to supply material for clinical trials or any approved product could be delayed or stopped 

the manufacturing processes for our development candidates and investigational medicines are novel and complex there are no mrna medicines commercialized to date or manufactured at such scale due to the novel nature of this technology and limited experience at larger scale production we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing product release shelf life testing storage and supply chain management or shipping these difficulties could be due to any number of reasons including but not limited to complexities of producing batches at larger scale equipment failure choice and quality of raw materials and excipients analytical testing technology and product instability in an effort to optimize product features we have in the past and may in the future make changes to our development candidates or investigational medicines in their manufacturing and stability formulation and conditions this has in the past resulted in and may in the future result in our having to resupply batches for preclinical or clinical activities when there is insufficient product stability during storage and insufficient supply insufficient stability or shelf life of our development candidates and investigational medicines could materially delay our or our strategic collaborators’ ability to continue the clinical trial for that development candidate or investigational medicine or require us to begin a new clinical trial with a newly formulated drug product due to the need to manufacture additional preclinical or clinical supply 

our rate of innovation is high which has resulted in and will continue to cause a high degree of technology change that can negatively impact product comparability during and after clinical development furthermore technology changes may drive the need for changes in modification to or the sourcing of new manufacturing infrastructure or may adversely affect thirdparty relationships 

the process to generate mrna investigational medicines encapsulated in lnps is complex and if not developed and manufactured under wellcontrolled conditions can adversely impact pharmacological activity furthermore we have not manufactured mrna medicines at commercial scale we may encounter difficulties in scaling up our manufacturing process thereby potentially impacting clinical and commercial supply 

we are scaling up our batch size to accommodate the clinical supply requirements of some of our programs however in many cases we may have to utilize multiple batches of drug substance and drug product to meet the clinical supply requirement of a single clinical trial failure in our ability to scale up batch size or failure in any batch may lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trials 

as we continue developing new manufacturing processes for our drug substance and drug product the changes we implement to manufacturing process may in turn impact specification and stability of the drug product changes in our manufacturing processes may lead to failure of batches and this could lead to a substantial delay in our clinical trial our mrna investigational medicines may prove to have a stability profile that leads to a lower than desired shelf life of the final approved mrna medicine this poses risk in supply requirements wasted stock and higher cost of goods 

we are dependent on a number of equipment providers who are also implementing novel technology further we have developed our own custom manufacturing equipment for certain of our investigational medicines if such equipment malfunctions or we encounter unexpected performance issues we could encounter delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply due to the number of different programs we may have cross contamination of products inside of our factories cros suppliers or in the clinic that affect the integrity of our products 

as we scale the manufacturing output for particular programs we plan to continuously improve yield purity and the pharmaceutical properties of our development candidates from indenabling studies through commercial launch including shelf life stability and solubility properties of drug product and drug substance because of continuous improvement in manufacturing processes we may switch processes for a particular program during development however after the change in process more time is required for pharmaceutical property testing such as 6 or 12 month stability testing that may require resupplying clinical material or making additional cgmp batches to keep up with clinical trial demand before such pharmaceutical property testing is completed 

we are utilizing a number of raw materials and excipients that have a single source of supply are new to the pharmaceutical industry and are being employed in a novel manner some of these raw materials and excipients have not been scaled to a level to support 

commercial supply and could experience unexpected manufacturing or testing failures or supply shortages such issues with raw materials and excipients could cause delays or interruptions to clinical and commercial supply of our investigational medicines 

we have established a number of analytical assays and may have to establish several more to assess the quality of our mrna investigational medicines we may identify gaps in our analytical testing strategy that might prevent release of product or could require product withdrawal or recall for example we may discover new impurities that have an impact on product safety efficacy or stability this may lead to an inability to release mrna investigational medicines until the manufacturing or testing process is rectified 

our product and product intermediates are extremely temperature sensitive and we may learn that any or all of our products are less stable than desired we may also find that transportation conditions negatively impact product quality this may require changes to the formulation or manufacturing process for one or more of our investigational medicines and result in delays or interruptions to clinical or commercial supply in addition the cost associated with such transportation services and the limited pool of vendors may also add additional risks of supply disruptions 

as our drug development pipeline increases and matures the increased demand for clinical and commercial supplies from our facilities and third parties may impact our ability to operate we will require increased capacity across our entire supply chain furthermore we rely on many service providers including those that provide manufacturing or testing services all of whom have inherent risks in their operations that may adversely impact our operations 

we currently utilize and expect to continue to utilize third parties to among other things manufacture raw materials components parts and consumables and to perform quality testing if the field of mrna and other nucleic acid medicines continues to expand we may encounter increasing competition for these materials and services demand for thirdparty manufacturing or testing facilities may grow at a faster rate than their existing capacity which could disrupt our ability to find and retain thirdparty manufacturers capable of producing sufficient quantities of such raw materials components parts and consumables required to manufacture our mrna investigational medicines the use of service providers and suppliers could expose us to risks including but not limited to 

 we are subject to regulatory and operational risks associated with the physical and digital infrastructure at both our internal manufacturing facilities and at those of our external service providers 

in 2018 we completed construction of a new manufacturing facility in norwood ma or norwood that among other things is intended for cgmp manufacture of drug substance and drug product while the design of the facility is based on current standards for biotechnology facilities it has not been reviewed or preapproved by any regulatory agency nor has the facility been inspected by any regulatory agency such as the fda we have only recently begun producing drug substance and drug product at norwood for our preclinical and clinical use we could incur delays in implementing the full operational state of the facility causing delays to clinical supply or extended use of thirdparty service providers resulting in unplanned expenses in constructing the norwood facility we have incurred substantial expenditures and expect to incur significant additional expenditures in validating and operating the facility in the future 

we have designed norwood to incorporate a significant level of automation of equipment with integration of several digital systems to improve efficiency of operations we have attempted to achieve a high level of digitization for a clinical manufacturing facility relative to industry standards while this is meant to improve operational efficiency this may pose additional risk of process equipment malfunction and even overall manufacturing system failure or shutdown due to internal or external factors including but not limited to design issues system compatibility or potential cybersecurity breaches this may lead to delay in supply or shutdown of our facility any disruption in our manufacturing capabilities at norwood could cause delays in our production capacity for our drug substances or drug products impose additional costs or may require us to identify qualify and establish an alternative manufacturing site the occurrence of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

as we expand our development and commercial capacity we may establish additional manufacturing capabilities inside the norwood footprint or expand to other locations or geographies which may lead to regulatory delays or prove costly if we fail to select the correct location complete the construction in an efficient manner recruit the required personnel and generally manage our growth effectively the development and production of our investigational medicines could be delayed or curtailed additional investments may be needed if changes in our manufacturing process lead to required changes in norwood’s infrastructure 

there are risks inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing operations that could affect our ability and the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or contract manufacturing organizations to meet our delivery requirements or provide adequate amounts of material 

the convergence of process and analytical technology raw materials consumables equipment physical infrastructure including a clean room environment and air handling and other utilities results in complex procedures and systems that have to work effectively to manufacture our investigational medicines failure or process defects in any of the interrelated systems at either our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty providers could adversely impact our ability to manufacture and supply our investigational medicines 

our investigational medicines are inherently sensitive to shipping and storage conditions and could be subject to risk of loss or damage 

our investigational medicines are sensitive to temperature storage and handling conditions loss in investigational medicines could occur if the product or product intermediates are not stored or handled properly shelf life for our investigational medicines may vary by product and is not fully quantified and is expected to be variable and it is possible that our investigational medicines could be lost due to expiration prior to use this has in the past and could in the future lead to additional manufacturing costs and delays in our ability to supply required quantities for clinical trials or otherwise 

we are subject to significant regulatory oversight with respect to manufacturing our mrna investigational medicines our manufacturing facilities or the manufacturing facilities of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers may not meet regulatory requirements failure to meet cgmp requirements set forth in regulations promulgated by the fda ema and other global health authorities could result in significant delays in and costs of our products 

the manufacturing of vaccines and therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale is subject to extensive regulation components of a finished product approved for commercial use or used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cgmp requirements these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures including record keeping and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of products and materials used in clinical trials poor control of the cgmp production processes can lead to product quality failures that can impact our ability to supply product resulting in cost overruns and delays to clinical timelines which could be extensive such production process issues include but are not limited to 

 we must supply all necessary documentation in support of a bla or other marketing authorization application on a timely basis and must adhere to the fda’s ema’s and other countries’ cgmp requirements which are enforced in the case of the fda in part through its facilities inspection program 

regulatory authorities typically require representative manufacturing site inspections to assess adequate compliance with cgmps and manufacturing controls as described in the filing if either we or one of our thirdparty manufacturing sites fails to provide sufficient quality assurance or control the product approval to commercialize may not be granted inspections by regulatory authorities may occur at any time during the development or commercialization phase of products the inspections may be product specific or facility specific for broader cgmp inspections or as a follow up to market or development issues that the regulatory agency may identify deficient inspection outcomes may influence the ability of our thirdparty manufacturers or suppliers to fulfill their supply obligations impacting or delaying supply or delaying programs 

the manufacturing process for any products that we may develop is subject to the fda and foreign regulatory authority approval process and we may need to contract with manufacturers who we believe can meet applicable fda and foreign regulatory authority requirements on an ongoing basis if we or our thirdparty manufacturers are unable to reliably produce investigational medicines to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities we or our strategic collaborators may not obtain or maintain the approvals we or they need to commercialize such products even if we or our strategic collaborators obtain regulatory approval for any of our mrna medicines there is no assurance that either we or our contract manufacturing organizations will be able to manufacture the approved medicine to specifications acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities to produce it in sufficient quantities to meet the requirements for the potential launch of the product or to meet potential future demand any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials increase clinical trial costs delay approval of our investigational medicines impair commercialization efforts or increase our cost of goods the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and growth prospects 

in addition we may not have direct control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control quality assurance and qualified personnel furthermore all of our contract manufacturers are engaged with other companies to supply or manufacture materials or products for such companies which exposes our contract manufacturers to regulatory risks for the production of such materials and products as a result failure to meet the regulatory requirements for the production of those materials and products may generally affect the regulatory status of our contract manufacturers’ facility our failure or the failure of our thirdparty manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us including clinical holds fines injunctions civil penalties delays suspension or withdrawal of approvals license revocation seizures or recalls of investigational medicines or products operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products and investigational medicines including those of our strategic collaborators and our overall business operations our potential future dependence upon others for the manufacture of our investigational medicines and raw materials may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that receive regulatory approval on a timely and competitive basis 

the fda the ema and other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to submit product samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time under some circumstances the fda the ema or other foreign regulatory authorities may require that we do not distribute a lot or lots until the relevant agency authorizes such release deviations in the manufacturing process including those affecting quality attributes and stability may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls our thirdparty contract manufacturers have in the past experienced lot failures and some may have experienced product recalls lot failures have in the past caused and lot failures or product recalls in the future with respect to product produced by either our own facilities or those of our thirdparty manufacturers could cause us and our strategic collaborators to delay clinical trials or product launches which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific qualitycontrol and manufacturing personnel needed to operate our manufacturing processes and operations which could result in delays in production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements while we will train and qualify all personnel around the appropriate handling of our products and materials we may not be able to control for or ultimately detect intentional sabotage or negligence by any employee or contractor 

risks specific to certain investigational medicines 

our pcv investigational medicine is uniquely manufactured for each patient using a novel complex manufacturing process and we may encounter difficulties in production 

we custom design and manufacture pcvs that are unique and tailored specifically for each patient manufacturing unique lots of pcvs is susceptible to product loss or failure due to issues with 



 we have built and installed custom manufacturing equipment for pcv which has been incorporated into a personalized vaccine unit in norwood this unit is currently operational and we are producing batches of pcv from our location and a thirdparty suppliers this equipment may not function as designed which may lead to deviations in the drug product being produced this can lead to increased batch failure and the inability to supply patients enrolled in the clinical trial if our clinical development plans are expanded due to the custom nature of the equipment and singleuse assemblies we may not be able to supply this expanded need reliably without significant investments in addition there will be considerable time to scale up our facilities or build new facilities before we can begin to meet any commercial demand if our pcv product is approved this expansion or addition of new facilities could also lead to product comparability issues which can further delay introduction of new capacity 

because our pcvs are manufactured for each individual patient we will be required to maintain a chain of identity with respect to each patient’s tissue sample sequence data derived from such tissue sample results of analysis of such patient’s genomic analysis and the custom manufactured product for each patient maintaining such a chain of identity is difficult and complex and failure to do so has in the past and may in the future result in product mix up adverse patient outcomes loss of product or regulatory action including withdrawal of any approved products from the market further as our pcv investigational medicine is developed through earlystage clinical studies to laterstage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization we expect that multiple aspects of the complicated collection analysis manufacture and delivery process will be modified in an effort to optimize processes and results these changes may not achieve the intended objectives and any of these changes could cause our pcvs to perform differently than we expect potentially affecting the results of clinical trials 

risks related to our reliance on third parties 

we have in the past entered into and in the future may enter into strategic alliances with third parties to develop investigational medicines if these strategic alliances are not successful our business could be adversely affected 

we have limited resources to conduct clinical operations and have not yet established infrastructure for sales marketing or distribution accordingly we have entered into strategic alliances under which our strategic collaborators have provided and may in the future provide funding and other resources for developing and potentially commercializing our investigational medicines we expect to enter into additional strategic alliances to access additional funding capabilities and expertise in the future our existing strategic alliances and any future strategic alliances we enter into may pose a number of risks including the following 



 if our strategic alliances do not result in the successful development and commercialization of programs or if one of our strategic collaborators terminates its agreement with us we may not receive any future research funding or milestone earnout royalty or other contingent payments under the strategic alliances if we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements our development of investigational medicines could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop our investigational medicines in addition in general our strategic collaborators have the right to terminate their agreements with us for convenience a strategic collaborator has in the past terminated its agreement with us if one of our strategic collaborators terminates its agreement with us we may find it more difficult to attract new strategic collaborators and the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected all of the risks relating to product development regulatory approval and commercialization described in this annual report on form 10k apply to the activities of our strategic collaborators 

our strategic collaborators control aspects of our clinical trials regulatory activities and other aspects of our strategic alliances which could result in delays and other obstacles in the development and commercialization of our proposed products and materially harm our results of operations 

for some programs we depend on strategic collaborators to design and conduct clinical trials for our investigational medicines as a result we may not control the manner or time schedule in which these clinical trials are conducted which may negatively impact our business operations in addition if any of our strategic collaborators withdraws support for one or more of our programs or proposed products or otherwise impairs their development our business could be negatively affected 

we may seek to establish additional strategic alliances and if we are not able to establish them on commercially reasonable terms we may have to alter our development and commercialization plans certain of our strategic alliance agreements may restrict our ability to develop certain products 

our development programs and the potential commercialization of our development candidates and investigational medicines will require substantial additional cash to fund expenses for some of our investigational medicines we may decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of those investigational medicines 

we face significant competition in seeking appropriate strategic collaborators whether we reach a definitive agreement for any additional strategic alliances will depend among other things upon our assessment of the strategic collaborator’s resources and expertise the terms and conditions of the proposed strategic alliance and the proposed strategic collaborator’s evaluation of a number of factors those factors may include the design or results of clinical trials the likelihood of approval by the fda or similar regulatory authorities outside the united states the potential market for the subject investigational medicine the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such investigational medicine to trial participants the potential of competing drugs the existence of uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership without regard to the merits of the challenge and industry and market conditions generally the strategic collaborator may also consider alternative investigational medicines or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a collaboration could be more attractive than the one with us for our investigational medicine the terms of any additional strategic alliances or other arrangements that we may establish may not be favorable to us 

we are also restricted under our existing strategic alliance agreements from entering into certain future agreements on certain terms with potential strategic collaborators to pursue other targets on our own these restrictions on working with targets polypeptides routes of administration and fields could limit our ability to enter into strategic collaborations with future strategic collaborators or to pursue certain potentially valuable development candidates or investigational medicines 

we may not be able to negotiate additional strategic alliances on a timely basis on favorable terms or at all strategic alliances are complex and timeconsuming to negotiate and document if we are unable to negotiate and enter into new strategic alliances we may have to curtail the development of the investigational medicine for which we are seeking to collaborate reduce or delay its development program or one or more of our other development programs delay its potential commercialization or reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense if we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own we may need to obtain additional capital which may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all if we do not have sufficient funds we may not be able to further develop our investigational medicines or bring them to market and generate product revenue 

we are dependent on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and the processes required to develop our development candidates and investigational medicines 

we currently depend on singlesource suppliers for some of the components and materials used in and manufacturing processes required to develop our development candidates and investigational medicines we cannot ensure that these suppliers or service providers will remain in business have sufficient capacity or supply to meet our needs or that they will not be purchased by one of our competitors or another company that is not interested in continuing to work with us our use of singlesource suppliers of raw materials components key processes and finished goods exposes us to several risks including disruptions in supply price increases or late deliveries there are in general relatively few alternative sources of supply for substitute components these vendors may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands for our clinical trials or commercial sale establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these components materials and processes could take a substantial amount of time and it may be difficult to establish replacement suppliers who meet regulatory requirements any disruption in supply from any singlesource supplier or service provider could lead to supply delays or interruptions which would damage our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we have to switch to a replacement supplier the manufacture and delivery of our development candidates or investigational medicines could be interrupted for an extended period which could adversely affect our business establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the components or processes used in our investigational medicines if required may not be accomplished quickly if we are able to find a replacement supplier the replacement supplier would need to be qualified and may require additional regulatory authority approval which could result in further delay while we seek to maintain adequate inventory of the single source components and materials used in our products any interruption or delay in the supply of components or materials or our inability to obtain components or materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner could impair our ability to meet the demand for our investigational medicines 

in addition as part of the fda’s approval of our investigational medicines we will also require fda review of the individual components of our process which include the manufacturing processes and facilities of our singlesource suppliers 

our reliance on these suppliers service providers and manufacturers subjects us to a number of risks that could harm our reputation business and financial condition including among other things 



 if any of these risks materialize costs could significantly increase and our ability to meet demand for our products could be impacted 

we rely on and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct aspects of our research preclinical studies protocol development and clinical trials for our development candidates or investigational medicines if these third parties do not perform satisfactorily comply with regulatory requirements or meet expected deadlines we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our investigational medicines and our business could be substantially harmed 

we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties such as cros clinical data management organizations medical institutions and clinical investigators to conduct our clinical trials we currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties to conduct certain research and preclinical testing activities in some cases these third parties may terminate their engagements with us if we need to enter into alternative arrangements it would delay our discovery or product development activities 

our reliance on these third parties for research and development activities will reduce our control over these activities but will not relieve us of our regulatory or contractual responsibilities we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our preclinical studies and clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards for example we will remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial moreover the fda requires us to comply with regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices or gcps for conducting recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights integrity and confidentiality of trial participants are protected we also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a governmentsponsored database clinicaltrialsgov within certain timeframes failure to do so can result in fines adverse publicity and civil and criminal sanctions for any violations of laws and regulations during the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials we could be subject to warning letters or enforcement action that may include civil penalties up to and including criminal prosecution 

we and our cros will be required to comply with regulations including gcps for conducting monitoring recording and reporting the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately informed among other things of the potential risks of participating in clinical trials we also are responsible for ensuring that the rights of our clinical trial participants are protected these regulations are enforced by the fda the competent authorities of the member states of the european economic area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any investigational medicines in clinical development the fda enforces gcp regulations through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors principal investigators and trial sites if we or our cros fail to comply with applicable gcps the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the fda or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications we cannot assure you that upon inspection the fda will determine that any of our future clinical trials will comply with gcps in addition our clinical trials must be conducted with investigational medicines produced in accordance with the requirements in cgmp regulations our failure or the failure of our cros to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials which would delay the regulatory approval process and could also subject us to enforcement action 

although we intend to design the clinical trials for certain of our investigational medicines our strategic collaborators will design the clinical trials that they are managing in some cases with our input and in the case of clinical trials controlled by us we expect that cros will conduct all of the clinical trials as a result many important aspects of our development programs including their conduct and timing will be outside of our direct control our reliance on third parties to conduct future preclinical studies and clinical trials will also result in less direct control over the management of data developed through preclinical studies and clinical trials than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff communicating with outside parties can also potentially lead to mistakes as well as difficulties in coordinating activities outside parties may 



 these factors may materially adversely affect the willingness or ability of third parties to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and may subject us to unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control if the cros do not perform preclinical studies and clinical trials in a satisfactory manner breach their obligations to us or fail to comply with regulatory requirements the development regulatory approval and commercialization of our investigational medicines may be delayed we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our investigational medicines or our development programs may be materially and irreversibly harmed if we are unable to rely on preclinical and clinical data collected by our cros we could be required to repeat extend the duration of or increase the size of any clinical trials we conduct and this could significantly delay commercialization and require significantly greater expenditures 

we also expect to rely on other third parties to transport store and distribute the required materials for our clinical trials in the past certain of our thirdparty vendors have mishandled our materials resulting in loss of full or partial lots of material any further performance failure on the part of these third parties could result in damaged products and could delay clinical development or marketing approval of any investigational medicines we may develop or commercialization of our medicines if approved producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue causing us to default on our contractual commitments result in losses that are not covered by insurance and damage our reputation and overall perception of our products in the marketplace 

risks related to our intellectual property 

other companies or organizations may challenge our patent rights or may assert patent rights that prevent us from developing and commercializing our products 

mrna medicines is a relatively new scientific field the continued development and potential use of which has resulted in many different patents and patent applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain intellectual property protection in the field we have obtained grants and issuances of patents on mrna medicines and our delivery technology the issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states and in key markets around the world that we own claim many different methods compositions and processes relating to the discovery development manufacture and commercialization of mrna medicines and our delivery technology including lnps 

as the field of mrna therapeutics and vaccines is maturing patent applications are being processed by national patent offices around the world there is uncertainty about which patents will issue and if they do as to when to whom and with what claims it is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings such as interference reexamination and opposition proceedings as well as  inter partes  and postgrant review proceedings introduced by provisions of the america invents act which became available to thirdparty challengers on september 16 2012 in various patent offices relating to patent rights in the mrna field we expect that oppositions will be filed in the european patent office or epo and elsewhere relating to patents and patent applications in our portfolio in many cases the possibility of appeal exists for either us or our opponents and it may be years before final unappealable rulings are made with respect to these patents in certain jurisdictions the timing and outcome of these and other proceedings is uncertain and may adversely affect our business if we are not successful in defending the patentability and scope of our pending and issued patent claims for example a third party request for reexamination has been granted against of one of our us patents which relates to our influenza vaccine program we cannot be certain that such patent will survive or that the claims will remain in the current form in addition third parties may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights even if our rights are not directly challenged disputes could lead to the weakening of our intellectual property rights our defense against any attempt by third parties to circumvent or invalidate our intellectual property rights could be costly to us could require significant time and attention of our management and could have a material adverse impact on our business and our ability to successfully compete in the field of mrna therapeutics 

there are many issued and pending patents that claim aspects of oligonucleotide delivery technologies that we may need for our mrna therapeutic and vaccine candidates there are also many issued patents that claim targeting genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for mrna medicines we wish to develop for example we are aware of a thirdparty patent directed to methods of using mrna to treat fabry disease in addition there may be issued and pending patent applications that may be asserted against us in a court proceeding or otherwise based upon the asserting party’s belief that we may need such patents for our mrna therapeutic candidates thus it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we may need a license or hold patent rights which could be asserted against us if those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on reasonable terms 

or a court rules that we need such patent rights that have been asserted against us and we are not able to obtain a license on reasonable terms we may be unable to perform research and development or other activities or market products covered by such patents 

if we become involved in patent litigation or other proceedings related to a determination of rights we could incur substantial costs and expenses substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts 

our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties there is a substantial amount of litigation both within and outside the united states involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries including patent infringement lawsuits interferences oppositions  ex parte  reexaminations postgrant review and  inter partes  review proceedings before the us patent and trademark office or uspto and corresponding foreign patent offices numerous us and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications which are owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates in certain instances we have instituted and may in the future institute  inter partes  review proceedings against issued us patents and opposition proceedings against european patents owned by third parties in the field of mrna medicines we have a number of these proceedings ongoing against thirdparty patents related to cancer vaccinations and mrna delivery as the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued the risk increases that our development candidates may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties 

third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization there may be thirdparty patents or patent applications with claims to materials formulations methods of manufacture or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our investigational medicines because patent applications can take many years to issue there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our investigational medicines may infringe in addition third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our technologies infringe upon these patents if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover the manufacturing process of any of our investigational medicines any molecules formed during the manufacturing process or any final product itself the holders of any such patents may obtain injunctive or other equitable relief which could effectively block our ability to commercialize such investigational medicine unless we obtained a license under the applicable patents or until such patents expire similarly if any thirdparty patents were held by a court of competent jurisdiction to cover aspects of our formulations processes for manufacture or methods of use including combination therapy the holders of any such patents may be able to block our ability to develop and commercialize the applicable investigational medicine unless we obtained a license or until such patent expires in either case such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all for example if we are unsuccessful in invalidating certain of the thirdparty patents that we are currently challenging those third parties may attempt to assert those patents against us should certain of our investigational medicines obtain regulatory approval 

defense of infringement and other claims regardless of their merit would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us we may have to pay substantial damages including treble damages and attorneys’ fees for willful infringement pay royalties redesign our infringing products or obtain one or more licenses from third parties which may not be made available on commercially favorable terms if at all or may require substantial time and expense 

in addition such licenses are likely to be nonexclusive and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us if we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent we may be unable to effectively market some of our technology and products which could limit our ability to generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations moreover we expect that a number of our collaborations will provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our intellectual property may be offset by amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior intellectual property positions in the relevant fields which could result in significant reductions in our revenues from products developed through collaborations 

in addition in connection with certain license and strategic alliance agreements we have agreed to indemnify certain third parties for certain costs incurred in connection with litigation relating to intellectual property rights or the subject matter of the agreements the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights even if resolved in our favor could be substantial and litigation would divert our management’s efforts some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could delay our research and development efforts and limit our ability to continue our operations 

we may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary intellectual property rights to product components and manufacturing processes for our development pipeline 

presently we have rights to certain ip through licenses from third parties and under patents that we own to develop our development candidates or investigational medicines because our pipeline may involve additional development candidates that could require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties the growth of our business could depend in part on our ability to acquire inlicense or use these proprietary rights in addition our development candidates or investigational medicines may require specific formulations to 

work effectively and efficiently and these rights may be held by others we may be unable to acquire or inlicense any compositions methods of use processes or other thirdparty ip rights from third parties that we identify the licensing and acquisition of thirdparty ip rights is a competitive area and a number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire thirdparty ip rights that we may consider attractive these established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities 

for example we sometimes collaborate with us and foreign academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions typically these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration regardless of such right of first negotiation for intellectual property we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified time frame or under terms that are acceptable to us if we are unable to do so the institution may offer the ip rights to other parties potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program 

in addition companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us we also may be unable to license or acquire thirdparty ip rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment if we are unable to successfully obtain rights to required thirdparty ip rights our business financial condition and prospects for growth could suffer 

if we are not able to obtain and enforce patent protection for our discoveries our ability to effectively compete using our development candidates will be harmed 

our success depends in part on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under the patent and other ip laws of the united states and other countries so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary information however we may not hold proprietary rights to some patents required for us to develop manufacture and commercialize our proposed products 

because certain us patent applications are confidential until the patents issue such as applications filed prior to november 29 2000 or applications filed after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications for this and other reasons we may be unable to secure desired patent rights thereby losing exclusivity further we may be required to obtain licenses under thirdparty patents to market our proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities if licenses are not available to us on favorable terms we may not be able to market the affected products or conduct the desired activities 

our strategy depends on our ability to rapidly identify and seek patent protection for our discoveries in addition we may rely on thirdparty strategic collaborators to file patent applications relating to proprietary technology that we develop jointly as a part of certain strategic alliances the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and timeconsuming if our present or future strategic collaborators fail to file and prosecute all necessary and desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner our business may be adversely affected despite our efforts and the efforts of our strategic collaborators to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary while issued patents are presumed valid this does not guarantee that the patent will survive a validity challenge or be held enforceable any patents we have obtained or obtain in the future may be challenged invalidated adjudged unenforceable or circumvented by parties attempting to design around our intellectual property moreover third parties or the uspto may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or patent applications any challenge to finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention of our patents or patent applications would be costly would require significant time and attention of our management could reduce or eliminate royalty payments to us from thirdparty licensors and could have a material adverse impact on our business 

our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents the patent position of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies including ours is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual considerations the standards that the uspto and its foreign counterparts use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change similarly the ultimate degree of protection that will be afforded to biotechnology inventions including ours in the united states and foreign countries remains uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of the protection decided upon by patent offices courts and lawmakers moreover there are periodic discussions in the congress of the united states and in international jurisdictions about modifying various aspects of patent law for example the america invents act which took effect in march 2013 included a number of changes to the patent laws of the united states if any of the enacted changes prevent us from adequately protecting our discoveries including our ability to pursue infringers of our patents to obtain injunctive relieve or for substantial damages our business could be adversely affected one major provision of the america invents act changed us patent practice from a firsttoinvent to a firsttofile system if we fail to file an invention before a competitor files on the same invention we no longer have the ability to provide proof that we were in possession of the invention prior to the competitor’s filing date and thus would not be able to obtain patent protection for our invention there is also no uniform worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents in certain countries for example methods for the medical treatment of humans are not patentable 

accordingly we do not know the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents issued to us or to others we also rely to a certain extent on trade secrets knowhow and technology which are not 

protected by patents to maintain our competitive position if any trade secret knowhow or other technology not protected by a patent were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

we license patent rights from thirdparty owners if such owners do not properly or successfully obtain maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses our competitive position and business prospects may be harmed 

we are a party to licenses that give us rights to thirdparty ip that is necessary or useful for our business in particular we have obtained licenses from cellscript llc and its affiliates to patent rights covering modified mrna chemistries and from certain other parties for ip useful in our formulation efforts we may enter into additional licenses to thirdparty ip in the future 

our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and enforce patent protection for our licensed ip our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications we license even if patents issue in respect of these patent applications our licensors may fail to maintain these patents may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would without protection for the ip we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could adversely affect our competitive business position and harm our business prospects in addition we sublicense our rights under various thirdparty licenses to our strategic collaborators any impairment of these sublicensed rights could result in reduced revenues under our strategic alliance agreements or result in termination of an agreement by one or more of our strategic collaborators 

disputes may also arise between us and our licensors regarding ip subject to a license agreement including 

 if disputes over ip that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected development candidates 

we are generally also subject to all of the same risks with respect to protection of ip that we license as we are for ip that we own which are described below if we or our licensors fail to adequately protect this ip our ability to commercialize products could suffer 

if we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license ip rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors we could lose license rights that are important to our business 

licensing of ip is important to our business and involves complex legal business and scientific issues and is complicated by the rapid pace of scientific discovery in our industry we are a party to certain ip license agreements that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional license agreements in the future our existing license agreements impose and we expect that future license agreements will impose various diligence milestone payment royalty and other obligations on us if we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or we are subject to a bankruptcy the licensor may have the right to terminate the license in which event we would not be able to market products covered by the license 

in some cases patent prosecution of our licensed technology is controlled solely by the licensor if our licensors fail to obtain and maintain patent or other protection for the proprietary ip we license from them we could lose our rights to the ip and our competitors could market competing products using the ip in certain cases we control the prosecution of patents resulting from licensed technology in the event we breach any of our obligations related to such prosecution we may incur significant liability to our strategic collaborators disputes may arise regarding ip subject to a licensing agreement including 



 if disputes over ip that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on favorable terms we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected development candidates or investigational medicines 

if we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets our business and competitive position would be harmed 

in addition to patent protection we rely heavily upon knowhow and trade secret protection as well as nondisclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees consultants and third parties to protect our confidential and proprietary information especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable in addition to contractual measures we try to protect the confidential nature of our proprietary information using physical and technological security measures such measures may not for example in the case of misappropriation of a trade secret by an employee or third party with authorized access provide adequate protection for our proprietary information our security measures may not prevent an employee or consultant from misappropriating our trade secrets and providing them to a competitor and recourse we take against such misconduct may not provide an adequate remedy to protect our interests fully enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret can be difficult expensive and timeconsuming and the outcome is unpredictable in addition trade secrets may be independently developed by others in a manner that could prevent legal recourse by us if any of our confidential or proprietary information such as our trade secrets were to be disclosed or misappropriated or if any such information was independently developed by a competitor our competitive position could be harmed 

certain former employees have obtained employment with companies or academic institutions that could be considered competitive with us and are operating their business in areas that are similar to ours including in their business model product discovery efforts mrna based product development or formulation technology such as our lnps this competition may be limited by contractual provisions which may or may not be enforceable by us in the commonwealth of massachusetts or other jurisdictions in addition we may not be aware of such competitive employment arrangements until after our trade secrets have been disclosed to potentially competitive companies 

we may be subject to claims that our employees consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed confidential information of third parties or that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 

we employ individuals who were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies including our competitors or potential competitors although we try to ensure that our employees consultants and independent contractors do not use the proprietary information or knowhow of others in their work for us we may be subject to claims that we or our employees consultants or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed intellectual property including trade secrets or other proprietary information of any of our employees’ former employers or other third parties litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights or personnel which could adversely impact our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

we may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship or ownership of our patents and other ip 

we may be subject to claims that former employees collaborators or other third parties have an ownership interest in our patents or other ip ownership disputes may arise for example from conflicting obligations of consultants or others who are involved in developing our development candidates litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership if we fail in defending any such claims in addition to paying monetary damages we may lose valuable ip rights such as exclusive ownership of or right to use valuable ip such an outcome could have a material adverse impact on our business even if we are successful in defending against such claims litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees 

obtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural document submission fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for noncompliance with these requirements 

periodic maintenance fees renewal fees annuity fees and various other governmental fees on patents or applications will be due to be paid to the uspto and various governmental patent agencies outside of the united states in several stages over the lifetime of the patents or applications we have systems in place to remind us to pay these fees and we employ an outside firm and rely on our outside counsel to pay these fees due to nonus patent agencies the uspto and various nonus governmental patent agencies 

require compliance with a number of procedural documentary fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process we employ reputable law firms and other professionals to help us comply and in many cases an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules however there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction in such an event our competitors might be able to enter the market and this circumstance would have a material adverse impact on our business 

issued patents covering our development candidates and investigational medicines could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court 

if we or one of our strategic collaborators initiated legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering one of our development candidates or investigational medicines the defendant could counterclaim that the patent covering our development candidate or investigational medicine is invalid or unenforceable in patent litigation in the united states defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements including patent eligible subject matter lack of novelty obviousness or nonenablement grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the uspto or made a misleading statement during prosecution third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the united states or abroad even outside the context of litigation such mechanisms include reexamination postgrant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions eg opposition proceedings such proceedings could result in revocation of or amendment to our patents in such a way that they no longer cover our development candidates or investigational medicines the outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable with respect to the validity question for example we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution if a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity andor unenforceability we would lose at least part and perhaps all of the patent protection on our development candidates and investigational medicines such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business 

changes in us patent law could diminish the value of patents in general thereby impairing our ability to protect our products 

as is the case with other biotechnology companies our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property particularly patents obtaining and enforcing patents in the biotechnology industry involve both technological and legal complexity and therefore obtaining and enforcing biotechnology patents is costly timeconsuming and inherently uncertain in addition the united states has recently enacted and is currently implementing wideranging patent reform legislation recent us supreme court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations in addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents once obtained depending on decisions by the us congress the federal courts and the uspto the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that would weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future 

we may not be able to protect our ip rights throughout the world 

filing prosecuting and defending patents on development candidates and investigational medicines in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive and our ip rights in some countries outside the united states can be less extensive than those in the united states in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect ip rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the united states consequently we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the united states or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the united states or other jurisdictions competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong as that in the united states these products may compete with our products and our patents or other ip rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing 

many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending ip rights in foreign jurisdictions the legal systems of certain countries particularly certain developing countries do not favor the enforcement of patents trade secrets and other ip protection particularly those relating to biotechnology products which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our proprietary rights generally proceedings to enforce our patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us we may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded if any may not be commercially meaningful accordingly our efforts to enforce our ip rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the ip that we develop or license 

our reliance on government funding for certain of our programs adds uncertainty to our research and development efforts with respect to those programs and may impose requirements that increase the costs of commercialization and production of any programs developed under those governmentfunded programs 

the development of each of our zika vaccines mrna1325 and mrna1893 our antibody against chikungunya virus mrna1944 and our chikungunya vaccine mrna1388 are currently being funded through subcontracts with funding from either barda or darpa contracts and grants funded by the us government and its agencies including our agreements funded by barda and darpa include provisions that reflect the government’s substantial rights and remedies many of which are not typically found in commercial contracts including powers of the government to 

 we may not have the right to prohibit the us government from using certain technologies developed by us and we may not be able to prohibit thirdparty companies including our competitors from using those technologies in providing products and services to the us government the us government generally takes the position that it has the right to royaltyfree use of technologies that are developed under us government contracts 

in addition government contracts and grants and subcontracts and subawards awarded in the performance of those contracts and grants normally contain additional requirements that may increase our costs of doing business reduce our profits and expose us to liability for failure to comply with these terms and conditions these requirements include for example 

 as an organization we are relatively new to government contracting and new to the regulatory compliance obligations that such contracting entails if we fail to maintain compliance with those obligations we may be subject to potential liability and to termination of our contracts 

as a us government contractor we are subject to financial audits and other reviews by the us government of our costs and performance on their contracts as well as our accounting and general business practices related to these contracts based on the results of its audits the government may adjust our contractrelated costs and fees including allocated indirect costs although adjustments arising from government audits and reviews have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past we cannot assure you that future audits and reviews will not have those effects 

risks related to commercialization of our pipeline 

we have no sales distribution or marketing experience and may invest significant financial and management resources to establish these capabilities if we are unable to establish such capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to market and sell our future products if approved we may be unable to generate any revenues 

given our stage of development we have no sales distribution or marketing experience to successfully commercialize any products that may result from our development programs we will need to develop sales and marketing capabilities in the united states europe and other regions either on our own or with others we may enter into strategic alliances with other entities to utilize their mature marketing and distribution capabilities but we may be unable to enter into marketing agreements on favorable terms if at all if our future strategic collaborators do not commit sufficient resources to commercialize our future products if any and we are unable to develop the necessary marketing capabilities on our own we may be unable to generate sufficient product revenue to sustain our business we will be competing with many companies that currently have extensive and wellfunded marketing and sales operations without a significant internal team or the support of a third party to perform marketing and sales functions we may be unable to compete successfully against these more established companies 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive if we are unable to compete effectively with existing drugs new treatment methods and new technologies we may be unable to commercialize successfully any drugs that we develop 

the pharmaceutical market is intensely competitive and rapidly changing many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations are pursuing the development of novel drugs for the same diseases that we are targeting or expect to target many of our competitors have 

 we will face intense competition from drugs that have already been approved and accepted by the medical community for the treatment of the conditions for which we may develop drugs we also expect to face competition from new drugs that enter the market there are a number of drugs currently under development which may become commercially available in the future for the treatment of conditions for which we are trying or may in the future try to develop drugs these drugs may be more effective safer less expensive or marketed and sold more effectively than any products we develop 

we anticipate competing with the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world many of which are all currently conducting research in the fields of infectious diseases immunooncology rare genetic diseases and cancer vaccines some of these companies have greater financial and human resources than we currently have in addition to these large pharmaceutical companies we may directly compete with fullyintegrated biopharmaceutical companies and other immunotherapyfocused oncology companies as well as a number of companies focused on mrna medicines or shared tumor antigen and neoantigen therapeutics some of which have entered into collaboration and funding agreements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies 

if we successfully develop investigational medicines and obtain approval for them we will face competition based on many different factors including 



our competitors may develop or commercialize products with significant advantages over any products we develop based on any of the factors listed above or on other factors in addition our competitors may develop strategic alliances with or receive funding from larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies providing them with an advantage over us our competitors may therefore be more successful in commercializing their products than we are which could adversely affect our competitive position and business competitive products may make any products we develop obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses of developing and commercializing our products if approved 

the commercial success of any current or future investigational medicine if approved will depend upon the degree of market acceptance by physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community 

ethical social and legal concerns about genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the products and processes we may use even with the requisite approvals the commercial success of our products will depend in part on the medical community patients and thirdparty or governmental payors accepting mrna medicines in general and our products in particular as medically useful costeffective and safe any product that we bring to the market may not gain market acceptance by physicians trial participants thirdparty payors and others in the medical community if these products do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance we may not generate significant product revenue and may not become profitable the degree of market acceptance of our investigational medicines if approved for commercial sale will depend on a number of factors including 

 even if a potential product displays a favorable efficacy and safety profile in preclinical and clinical studies market acceptance of the product will not be known until after it is launched our efforts to educate the medical community and thirdparty payors on the benefits of the products may require significant resources and may never be successful our efforts to educate the marketplace may require more resources than are required by the conventional technologies marketed by our competitors due to the complexity and uniqueness of our programs 

even if we are successful in getting marketing approval for any product commercial success of any approved products will also depend in large part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from thirdparty payors including government payors such as the medicare and medicaid programs and entry into managed care organizations which may be affected by existing and future healthcare reform measures designed to reduce the cost of healthcare thirdparty payors could require us to conduct additional studies including postmarketing studies related to the cost effectiveness of a product to qualify for reimbursement which could be costly and divert our resources if government and other healthcare payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for any of our products once approved whether due to healthcare reform legislation or otherwise market acceptance and commercial success would be reduced 

in addition if any of our products are approved for marketing we or a strategic collaborator will be subject to significant regulatory obligations regarding the submission of safety and other postmarketing information and reports for such product and will need to continue to comply or ensure that our thirdparty providers comply with cgmp and current gcps for any clinical trials that we or a strategic collaborator conduct postapproval in addition there is always the risk that we or a strategic collaborator or regulatory authority might identify previously unknown problems with a product postapproval such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency compliance with these requirements is costly and any such failure to comply or other issues with our investigational medicines identified postapproval could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations 

we may market our products outside of the united states and we will be subject to the risks of doing business outside of the united states 

because we plan to market our products if approved outside of the united states our business is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the united states including an increase in our expenses diversion of our management’s attention from the acquisition or development of investigational medicines or forgoing profitable licensing opportunities in these geographies accordingly our business and financial results in the future could be adversely affected due to a variety of factors including 

 in addition to fda and related regulatory requirements in the united states and abroad we are subject to extensive additional federal state and foreign antibribery regulations which include the us foreign corrupt practices act the uk bribery act and similar laws in other countries outside of the united states we are developing and implementing a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry for companies similar to ours but we cannot guarantee that we our employees our consultants or our thirdparty contractors are or will be in compliance with all federal state and foreign regulations regarding bribery and corruption moreover our strategic collaborators and thirdparty contractors located outside the united states may have inadequate compliance programs or may fail to respect the laws and guidance of the territories in which they operate even if we are not determined to have violated these laws government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity which could also have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations 

the insurance coverage and reimbursement status of newlyapproved products in a new category of medicines is uncertain failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for new or current products could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue 

the availability and extent of reimbursement by governmental and private payors is essential for most patients to be able to afford expensive treatments such as the medicines that we hope to develop and sell in addition because our personalized cancer vaccine and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines represent new approaches to the treatment of cancer we cannot accurately estimate how these products would be priced whether reimbursement could be obtained or any potential revenue sales of our investigational medicines will depend substantially both domestically and abroad on the extent to which the costs of our investigational medicines will be paid by health maintenance managed care pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations or reimbursed by government health administration authorities private health coverage insurers and other thirdparty payors if reimbursement is not available or is available only to limited levels we may not be able to successfully commercialize our investigational medicines even if coverage is provided the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us to establish or maintain pricing sufficient to realize a sufficient return on our investment in any of our products 

there is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products including genetic medicines in the united states the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the centers for medicare  medicaid services or cms an agency within the us department of health and human services or hhs as cms decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under medicare private payors tend to follow cms to a substantial degree it is difficult to predict what cms will decide with respect to reimbursement for novel products such as ours reimbursement agencies in europe may be more conservative than cms for example a number of cancer drugs have been approved for reimbursement in the united states and have not been approved for reimbursement in certain european countries 

outside the united states certain countries including a number of member states of the european union set prices and reimbursement for pharmaceutical products or medicinal products as they are commonly referred to in the european union with limited participation from the marketing authorization holders we cannot be sure that such prices and reimbursement will be acceptable to us or our strategic collaborators if the regulatory authorities in these foreign jurisdictions set prices or reimbursement 

levels that are not commercially attractive for us or our strategic collaborators our revenues from sales by us or our strategic collaborators and the potential profitability of our drug products in those countries would be negatively affected an increasing number of countries are taking initiatives to attempt to reduce large budget deficits by focusing costcutting efforts on pharmaceuticals for their staterun healthcare systems these international price control efforts have impacted all regions of the world but have been most drastic in the european union additionally some countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed in many countries the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted as a result we might obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country but then may experience delays in the reimbursement approval of our product or be subject to price regulations that would delay our commercial launch of the product possibly for lengthy time periods which could negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that particular country 

moreover increasing efforts by governmental and thirdparty payors in the united states and abroad to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and level of reimbursement for new products approved and as a result they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our investigational medicines for example the us government recently released a “blueprint” or plan to reduce the cost of drugs this blueprint contains certain measures that the hhs is already working to implement for example on november 30 2018 cms announced a proposed rule that would amend the medicare advantage and medicare part d prescription drug benefit regulations to reduce out of pocket costs for plan enrollees and allow medicare plans to negotiate lower rates for certain drugs among other things the proposed rule changes would allow medicare advantage plans to use pre authorization or pa and step therapy or st for six protected classes of drugs and with certain exceptions permit plans to implement pa and st in medicare part b drugs and change the definition of “negotiated prices” as well as add a definition of “price concession” in the regulations it is unclear whether these proposed changes will be accepted at the state level legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing including price or patient reimbursement constraints discounts or restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures which in some cases are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing 

we expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our investigational medicines due to the trend toward managed healthcare the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes the downward pressure on healthcare costs in general particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments has become very intense as a result increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products 

healthcare legislative reform discourse and potential or enacted measures may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and legislative or political discussions surrounding the desire for and implementation of pricing reforms may adversely impact our business 

in the united states there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs for example in march 2010 the aca was passed which substantially changes the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly impacts the us pharmaceutical industry the aca among other things increased the minimum medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in medicaid managed care organizations established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and promoted a new medicare part d coverage gap discount program considerable uncertainty remains regarding the implementation and impact of the aca 

some of the provisions of the aca have yet to be fully implemented while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and congressional challenges the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 or the tcja includes a provision repealing effective january 1 2019 the taxbased shared responsibility payment imposed by the aca on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate” on december 14 2018 a us district court judge in the northern district of texas ruled that the individual mandate portion of the aca is an essential and inseverable feature of the aca and therefore because the mandate was repealed as part of the tax cuts and jobs act the remaining provisions of the aca are invalid as well the administration and cms have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect and on december 30 2018 the same judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal it is unclear how this decision and any subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the aca will impact the aca 

cms has recently proposed regulations that would give states greater flexibility in setting benchmarks for insurers in the individual and small group marketplaces which may have the effect of relaxing the essential health benefits required under the aca for plans sold through such marketplaces further on october 13 2017 an executive order was signed terminating the costsharing reduction or csr subsidies that reimburse insurers under the aca the loss of the csr payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the aca several state attorneys general filed suit to stop the administration from terminating the subsidies but their request for a restraining order was denied by a federal judge in california on october 25 2017 the loss of the cost share reduction payments is expected to increase premiums on certain policies issued by qualified health plans under the aca further on june 14 2018 the us court of appeals for the federal circuit ruled that the federal government was not required to pay more than 12 billion in aca risk corridor payments to thirdparty payors who argued were owed to them the effects 

of this gap in reimbursement on thirdparty payors the viability of the aca marketplace providers and potentially our business are not yet known 

another executive order was signed directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the aca to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision of the aca that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals healthcare providers health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices with the current presidential administration and congress there may be additional administrative or legislative changes including modification repeal or replacement of all or certain provisions of the aca however it remains to be seen whether new legislation modifying the aca will be enacted and if so precisely what the new legislation will provide when it will be enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare the implications of a potential repeal or replacement of the aca for our and our strategic collaborators’ business and financial condition if any are not yet clear 

in addition other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the united states since the aca was enacted the budget control act of 2011 among other things created measures for spending reductions by congress a joint select committee on deficit reduction tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least 12 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021 was unable to reach required goals thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs this includes aggregate reductions of medicare payments to providers up to 2 per fiscal year these reductions will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional congressional action is taken 

further legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products we cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted or whether fda regulations guidance or interpretations will be changed or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals if any of our development candidates may be in addition increased scrutiny by the us congress of the fda’s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post marketing conditions and other requirements 

the delivery of healthcare in the eu including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines is almost exclusively a matter for national rather than eu law and policy national governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context in general however the healthcare budgetary constraints in most eu member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers coupled with everincreasing eu and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our investigational medicines restrict or regulate postapproval activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval 

we expect that additional foreign state and federal healthcare reform measures or proposals will be adopted in the future any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services which could result in reduced demand for our investigational medicines or additional pricing pressures in the event that the pricing structures for healthcare products such as the investigational medicines we are developing change materially and limit payments for such investigational medicines our business will be adversely impacted as our products may no longer be commercially viable based on their expected net present value we may have invested significant resources in products that cannot be commercially developed or we may determine that assets that have reached an early phase of development cannot or will not be taken into further development notwithstanding their clinical viability in addition development assets or clinical programs that are part of our strategic alliances may no longer be deemed commercially viable to pursue based on our strategic collaborators’ assessments of the impact of any proposed announced or legislated pricing reforms 

we cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future further federal state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from investigational medicines that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop investigational medicines 

due to the novel nature of our technology we face uncertainty related to pricing and reimbursement for these investigational medicines 

target patient populations for certain of our investigational medicines such as those for rare genetic diseases may be relatively small and certain of our investigational medicines like pcv require customization on an individual scale as a result the pricing and reimbursement of our investigational medicines if approved must be adequate to support commercial infrastructure if we are unable to obtain adequate levels of reimbursement our ability to successfully market and sell our investigational medicines will be adversely affected the manner and level at which reimbursement is provided for services related to our investigational medicines eg for administration of our product to patients is also important inadequate reimbursement for such services may lead to physician resistance and adversely affect our ability to market or sell our products 

if the market opportunities for our development candidates or investigational medicines are smaller than we believe they are our revenue may be adversely affected and our business may suffer because the target patient populations for some of our programs are small we must be able to successfully identify clinical trial participants and achieve a significant market share to maintain profitability and growth 

an important area of focus of our research and product development activities is the development of treatments for severe rare genetic diseases our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our programs are based on estimates these estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases the number of clinical trial participants in the united states europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected may not be otherwise amenable to treatment with our products or new clinical trial participants may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to all of which would adversely affect our results of operations and our business 

the market opportunities of some of our programs may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for or have failed prior treatments and for which the market opportunities may be small 

the fda often approves new therapies initially only for use by patients with relapsed or refractory advanced disease we expect to initially seek approval of our pcv and intratumoral immunooncology investigational medicines in this context subsequently for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial if any we would expect to seek approval in earlier lines of treatment and potentially as a first line therapy but there is no guarantee that our investigational medicines even if approved would be approved for earlier lines of therapy and prior to any such approvals we may have to conduct additional clinical trials 

our projections of both the number of people who have the cancers we may be targeting as well as the subset of people with these cancers in a position to receive second or third line therapy and who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our investigational medicines are based on our beliefs and estimates these estimates have been derived from a variety of sources including scientific literature surveys of clinics patient foundations or market research and may prove to be incorrect further new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these cancers the number of trial participants may turn out to be lower than expected additionally the potentially addressable patient population for our investigational medicines may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our investigational medicines even if we obtain significant market share for our products if approved because the potential target populations are small we may never achieve profitability without obtaining regulatory approval for additional indications 

risks related to our business and operations 

we will need to develop and expand our company and we may encounter difficulties in managing this development and expansion which could disrupt our operations 

we have approximately 760  fulltime employees and in connection with the growth and advancement of our pipeline and becoming a public company we expect to increase the number of employees and the scope of our operations to manage our anticipated development and expansion including potential expansion outside of the united states we must continue to implement and improve our managerial operational and financial systems expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel also our management may need to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from its daytoday activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing these development activities 

as a growing biotechnology company we are actively pursuing development candidates and investigational medicines in many therapeutic areas and across a wide range of diseases successfully developing products for and fully understanding the regulatory and manufacturing pathways to all of these therapeutic areas and disease states requires a significant depth of talent resources and corporate processes in order to allow simultaneous execution across multiple areas due to our limited resources and early stage of growth we may not be able to effectively manage this simultaneous execution and the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel this may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure give rise to operational mistakes loss of business opportunities loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees the physical expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert financial resources from other projects such as the development of our investigational medicines if our management is unable to effectively manage our expected development and expansion our expenses may increase more than expected our ability to generate or increase our revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our investigational medicines if approved and compete effectively will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage the future development and expansion of our company 

our future success depends on our ability to retain key employees consultants and advisors and to attract retain and motivate qualified personnel we may not be able to retain employees or executives who have vested stock options 

our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial scientific and medical personnel we are highly dependent upon members of our management and 

scientific teams each of our executive officers and all of our employees including key scientists and clinicians are employed “at will” meaning we or each officer or employee may terminate the employment relationship at any time the loss of any of these persons’ services may adversely impact the achievement of our research development financing and commercialization objectives we currently do not have “key person” insurance on any of our employees many of our key employees including members of our executive team have been with us for a long period of time and have valuable fully vested stock options or other longterm equity incentives we may not be able to retain these employees due to the competitive environment in the biotechnology industry particularly in cambridge ma 

in addition we rely on consultants contractors and advisors including scientific and clinical advisors to assist us in formulating our research and development regulatory approval and commercialization strategy our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us the loss of the services of one or more of our current employees or advisors might impede the achievement of our research development regulatory approval and commercialization objectives in addition we have flexibly grown our workforce through the use of contractors and part time workers we may not be able to retain the services of such personnel which might result in delays in the operation of our business 

recruiting and retaining other qualified employees consultants and advisors for our business including scientific and technical personnel also will be critical to our success competition for skilled personnel including in mrna and lnp research clinical operations regulatory affairs therapeutic area management and manufacturing is intense and the turnover rate can be high we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on favorable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions for individuals with similar skill sets in addition adverse publicity failure to succeed in preclinical or clinical trials or applications for marketing approval may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel the inability to recruit or loss of services of certain executives key employees consultants or advisors may impede the progress of our research development and commercialization objectives and have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

our employees principal investigators and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading 

we are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees principal investigators and consultants misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with fda regulations or the regulations applicable in the eu and other jurisdictions provide accurate information to the fda the ema and other regulatory authorities comply with healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the united states and abroad or report financial information or data accurately or disclose unauthorized activities to us such misconduct also could involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or interactions with the fda or other regulatory authorities which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation sales marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud misconduct kickbacks selfdealing and other abusive practices these laws and regulations restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing discounting marketing and promotion sales commission customer incentive programs and other business arrangements we have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from government investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations if any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights those actions could have a significant impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions 

employee litigation and unfavorable publicity could negatively affect our future business 

our employees may from time to time bring lawsuits against us regarding injury creating a hostile work place discrimination wage and hour disputes sexual harassment or other employment issues in recent years there has been an increase in the number of discrimination and harassment claims generally coupled with the expansion of social media platforms and similar devices that allow individuals access to a broad audience these claims have had a significant negative impact on some businesses certain companies that have faced employment or harassmentrelated lawsuits have had to terminate management or other key personnel and have suffered reputational harm that has negatively impacted their business if we were to face any employmentrelated claims our business could be negatively affected 

we have never generated any revenue from product sales and may never be profitable 

our ability to generate revenue and achieve profitability depends on our ability alone or with strategic collaborators to successfully complete the development of and obtain the regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize our investigational medicines we do not anticipate generating revenues from product sales for the foreseeable future if ever our ability to generate future revenues from product sales depends heavily on our success in 

 even if one or more of the investigational medicines that we develop is approved for commercial sale we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved investigational medicine our expenses could increase beyond expectations if we are required by the fda the ema or other regulatory agencies to perform clinical and other studies or make changes to our manufacturing or quality systems in addition to those that we currently anticipate even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of any approved products we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations 

our internal computer systems or those of our strategic collaborators or other contractors or consultants may fail or suffer security breaches which could result in a material disruption of our product development programs and our manufacturing operations 

our internal computer systems and those of our current and any future strategic collaborators vendors and other contractors or consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses unauthorized access natural disasters terrorism cybersecurity threats war and telecommunication and electrical failures while we have not experienced any such material system failure accident or security breach to date that we are aware of if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations whether due to a loss of our trade secrets or other proprietary information or other similar disruptions for example the loss of clinical trial data from one or more ongoing or completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data in addition because of our approach to running multiple clinical trials in parallel any breach of our computer systems may result in a loss of data or compromised data integrity across many of our programs in many stages of development any such breach loss or compromise of clinical trial participant personal data may also subject us to civil fines and penalties either under the general data protection regulation or gdpr and relevant member state law in the eu other foreign laws and the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of 1996 or hipaa and other relevant state and federal privacy laws in the united states to the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information we could incur liability our competitive position could be harmed and the further development and commercialization of our investigational medicines could be delayed 

we may use our financial and human resources to pursue a particular research program or investigational medicine and fail to capitalize on programs or investigational medicines that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success 

because we have limited resources we must choose to pursue and fund the development of selected research programs or investigational medicines and may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other programs or investigational medicines that could later prove to have greater commercial potential our resource allocation decisions or our contractual commitments to provide resources to our strategic collaborators under strategic alliance agreements may cause us to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities our spending on current and future research and development programs for investigational medicines may not yield any commercially viable products if we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular investigational medicine we may relinquish valuable rights to that investigational medicine through a strategic alliance licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such investigational medicine or we may allocate internal resources to an investigational medicine in a therapeutic area in which it would have been more advantageous to enter into a strategic alliance 

if we are not successful in discovering developing and commercializing additional products beyond our current portfolio our ability to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives would be impaired 

although a substantial amount of our efforts will focus on the clinical trials and potential approval of our existing investigational medicines a key element of our strategy is to discover develop and potentially commercialize additional products beyond our current portfolio to treat various conditions and in a variety of therapeutic areas we intend to do so by investing in our own drug discovery efforts exploring potential strategic alliances for the development of new products and inlicensing technologies identifying new investigational medicines requires substantial technical financial and human resources whether or not any investigational medicines are ultimately identified even if we identify investigational medicines that initially show promise we may fail to successfully develop and commercialize such products for many reasons including the following 

 if we are unsuccessful in identifying and developing additional products our potential for growth may be impaired 

product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any investigational medicine that we may develop 

we face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of any of our current or future investigational medicines in clinical trials and we may face an even greater risk if we commercialize any investigational medicine that we may develop if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our investigational medicines caused injuries we could incur substantial liabilities regardless of merit or eventual outcome liability claims may result in 

 we carry product liability insurance which we believe to be sufficient in light of our current clinical programs however we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability if and when we obtain marketing approval for investigational medicines we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products however we may be unable to obtain product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or in 

adequate amounts on occasion large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs or medical treatments that had unanticipated adverse effects a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and if judgments exceed our insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations and business 

we may be subject directly or indirectly to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws false claims laws and health information privacy and security laws if we are unable to comply or have not fully complied with such laws we could face substantial penalties 

if we obtain fda approval for any of our investigational medicines and begin commercializing those products in the united states our operations will be directly or indirectly through our prescribers customers and purchasers subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws and regulations including without limitation the federal health care program antikickback statute the federal civil and criminal false claims act and physician payments sunshine act and regulations these laws will impact among other things our proposed sales marketing and educational programs in addition we may be subject to patient privacy laws enacted by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business the laws that will affect our operations include but are not limited to the following 

 because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us we may be subject to penalties including civil and criminal penalties damages fines exclusion from participation in government health care programs such as medicare and medicaid imprisonment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations 

the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription recommendation endorsement purchase supply order or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the eu the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is 

also governed by the national antibribery laws of eu member states such as the uk bribery act 2010 infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment 

payments made to physicians in certain eu member states must be publicly disclosed moreover agreements with physicians often must be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer his or her competent professional organization or the regulatory authorities of the individual eu member states these requirements are provided in the national laws industry codes or professional codes of conduct applicable in the eu member states failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk public reprimands administrative penalties fines or imprisonment 

the collection and use of personal health data in the european union had previously been governed by the provisions of the data protection directive which has been replaced by the gdpr which became effective on may 25 2018 while the data protection directive did not apply to organizations based outside the eu the gdpr has expanded its reach to include any business regardless of its location that provides goods or services to residents in the eu this expansion would incorporate our clinical trial activities in eu member states the gdpr imposes strict requirements on controllers and processors of personal data including special protections for “sensitive information” which includes health and genetic information of data subjects residing in the eu gdpr grants individuals the opportunity to object to the processing of their personal information allows them to request deletion of personal information in certain circumstances and provides the individual with an express right to seek legal remedies in the event the individual believes his or her rights have been violated further the gdpr imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the eu to the united states or other regions that have not been deemed to offer “adequate” privacy protections failure to comply with the requirements of the gdpr and the related national data protection laws of the eu member states which may deviate slightly from the gdpr may result in significant fines as a result of the implementation of the gdpr we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules 

there is significant uncertainty related to the manner in which data protection authorities will seek to enforce compliance with gdpr for example it is not clear if the authorities will conduct random audits of companies doing business in the eu or if the authorities will wait for complaints to be filed by individuals who claim their rights have been violated enforcement uncertainty and the costs associated with ensuring gdpr compliance may be onerous and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

if we fail to comply with environmental health and safety laws and regulations we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could harm our business 

we will become subject to numerous environmental health and safety laws and regulations including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling use storage treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes our operations will involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials including chemicals and biological materials our operations also may produce hazardous waste products we generally anticipate contracting with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes we will not be able to eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials in the event of contamination or injury resulting from any use by us of hazardous materials we could be held liable for any resulting damages and any liability could exceed our resources we also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties for failure to comply with such laws and regulations 

although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities we do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological or hazardous materials 

in addition we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental health and safety laws and regulations these current or future laws and regulations may impair our research development or production efforts our failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in substantial fines penalties or other sanctions 

unfavorable us or global economic conditions could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations 

our results of operations could be adversely affected by general conditions in the global economy and financial markets the most recent global financial crisis caused extreme volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets a severe or prolonged economic downturn such as the most recent global financial crisis could result in a variety of risks to our business including weakened demand for our investigational medicines and our ability to raise additional capital when needed on favorable terms if at all a weak or declining economy could strain our suppliers possibly resulting in supply disruption or cause delays in payments for our services by thirdparty payors or our collaborators any of the foregoing could harm our business and we cannot anticipate all of the ways in which the current economic climate and financial market conditions could adversely impact our business 

we or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other business interruptions such as cybersecurity attacks and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster 

natural disasters could severely disrupt our operations and have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and prospects if a natural disaster power outage cybersecurity attack or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters damaged critical infrastructure such as our manufacturing facilities or those of our thirdparty contract manufacturers limited our ability to access or use our digital information systems or that otherwise disrupted operations it may be difficult or in certain cases impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time the disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place currently are limited and are unlikely to prove adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event cybersecurity liability insurance is difficult to obtain and may not cover any damages we would sustain based on any breach of our computer security protocols or other cybersecurity attack we may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans which could have a material adverse impact on our business 

if our products become subject to a product recall it could harm our reputation business and financial results 

the fda and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of certain commercialized products in the case of the fda the authority to require a recall of a biologic product must be based on an fda finding that a batch lot of other quantity of the biologic product presents an imminent or substantial hazard to the public health in addition foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of any investigational medicine in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture manufacturers may under their own initiative recall a product if any material deficiency in a product is found a governmentmandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing errors design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues recalls of any of our investigational medicines would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations a recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales if any 

the investment of our cash cash equivalents and investments is subject to risks which may cause losses and affect the liquidity of these investments 

as of december 31 2018  we had approximately 17 billion  in cash cash equivalents and investments these investments are subject to general credit liquidity market and interest rate risks we may realize losses in the fair value of these investments which would have a negative effect on our consolidated financial statements in addition should our investments cease paying or reduce the amount of interest paid to us our interest income would suffer the market risks associated with our investment portfolio may have an adverse effect on our results of operations liquidity and financial condition 

comprehensive tax reform legislation could adversely affect our business and financial condition 

on december 22 2017 the tcja was signed into law which significantly reforms the internal revenue code of 1986 as amended or the code the tcja among other things contains significant changes to corporate taxation including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal tax rate of 35 to a flat rate of 21 limitation of the tax deduction for net business interest expense to 30 of adjusted taxable income with certain excepted businesses limitation of the deduction for net operating losses generated during or after 2018 to 80 of annual taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits including reducing the business tax credit for certain clinical testing expenses incurred in the testing of certain drugs for rare diseases or conditions generally referred to as “orphan drugs” we continue to examine the impact this tax reform legislation may have on our business however the effect of the tcja on our business whether adverse or favorable is uncertain and may not become evident for some period of time we urge investors to consult with their legal and tax advisers regarding the implications of the tcja on an investment in our common stock 

if the estimates we make or the assumptions on which we rely in preparing our consolidated financial statements prove inaccurate our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals 

our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets liabilities revenues and expenses the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances we cannot assure you however that our estimates or the assumptions underlying them will be correct 

the amount of and our ability to use net operating losses and research and development credits to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations and uncertainty 

as of december 31 2018  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of 4266 million  and 4020 million  respectively a portion of which will begin to expire in 2030 as of december 31 2018  we also had federal and state research and 

development tax credit carryforwards of 368 million  and 188 million  respectively which begin to expire in 2029  these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities in general under sections 382 and 383 of the code a corporation that undergoes an “ownership change” is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its prechange net operating losses or tax credits or nols or credits to offset future taxable income or taxes for these purposes an ownership change generally occurs where the aggregate stock ownership of one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who owns at least 5 of a corporation’s stock increases its ownership by more than 50 percentage points over its lowest ownership percentage within a specified testing period our existing nols or credits may be subject to limitations arising from ownership changes in connection with our initial public offering or after our initial public offering our ability to utilize nols or credits could be further limited by sections 382 and 383 of the code in addition future changes in our stock ownership many of which are outside of our control could result in an ownership change under sections 382 and 383 of the code our nols or credits may also be impaired under state law accordingly we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our nols or credits in addition the rules regarding timing of revenue and expense recognition for tax purposes in connection with various transactions we have are complex and uncertain in various respects and could be subject to challenge by taxing authorities in the event any such challenge is sustained the net operating losses could be materially reduced andor we could be determined to be a material cash taxpayer for one or more years furthermore our ability to utilize our nols or credits is conditioned upon our attaining profitability and generating us federal and state taxable income as described above we have incurred significant net losses since our inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and therefore we do not know whether or when we will generate the us federal or state taxable income necessary to utilize our nol or credit carryforwards under the tcja nols generated after december 31 2017  will not be subject to expiration but the deduction for such nols in any taxable year will be limited to 80 of our taxable income in such year where taxable income is determined without regard to the nol deduction itself the tcja also reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21 from a prior rate of 35 this may cause a reduction in the potential economic benefit of our nols and other available deferred tax assets 

if we engage in future acquisitions joint ventures or strategic collaborations this may increase our capital requirements dilute our stockholders cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 

we may evaluate various acquisitions and collaborations including licensing or acquiring complementary products intellectual property rights technologies or businesses any potential acquisition joint venture or collaboration may entail numerous risks including 

 in addition if we undertake acquisitions we may utilize our cash issue dilutive securities assume or incur debt obligations incur large onetime expenses and acquire intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense 

moreover we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition or strategic collaboration opportunities and this inability could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to technology or products that may be important to the development of our business 

the increasing use of social media platforms presents new risks and challenges 

social media is increasingly being used to communicate about our research development candidates investigational medicines and the diseases our development candidates and investigational medicines are being developed to treat social media practices in the biopharmaceutical industry continue to evolve and regulations relating to such use are not always clear this evolution creates uncertainty and risk of noncompliance with regulations applicable to our business resulting in potential regulatory actions against us for example patients may use social media channels to comment on their experience in an ongoing blinded clinical study or to report an alleged adverse event when such disclosures occur there is a risk that we fail to monitor and comply with applicable adverse event 

reporting obligations or we may not be able to defend our business or the public’s legitimate interests in the face of the political and market pressures generated by social media due to restrictions on what we may say about our development candidates and investigational medicines there is also a risk of inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information or negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us on any social networking website if any of these events were to occur or we otherwise fail to comply with applicable regulations we could incur liability face regulatory actions or incur other harm to our business 

risks related to ownership of our common stock 

the price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates substantially which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 

our stock price has been and in the future may be subject to substantial volatility for example our stock traded within a range of a high price of 2440 and a low price of 1303 per share for the period of december 7 2018 our first day of trading on the nasdaq global select market through march 6 2019 as a result of this volatility our stockholders could incur substantial losses 

the stock market in general and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies as a result of this volatility you may not be able to sell your common stock at or above your initial purchase price the market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors including 

 if our quarterly or annual results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts the price of our common stock could decline substantially furthermore any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our results may in turn cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially we believe that periodtoperiod comparisons of our results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 

in the past following periods of volatility in the market price of a company’s securities securities classaction litigation often has been instituted against that company such litigation if instituted against us could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management’s attention and resources which could seriously harm our business financial condition results of operations and prospects 

we incur increased costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management is required to devote substantial time to new compliance initiatives we are subject to financial reporting and other requirements for which our accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared 

as a public company and particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company” we incur significant legal accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company in addition the federal securities laws including the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 and rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq have imposed various requirements on public companies including requirements to file annual quarterly and event driven reports with respect to our business and financial condition and to establish and maintain effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives moreover these rules and regulations increase our legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more timeconsuming and costly for example we expect that these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance we may not be able to produce reliable financial statements or file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the sec or comply with the nasdaq listing requirements in addition we could make errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements 

pursuant to section 404 of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 or section 404 we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting including an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm however while we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to include an attestation report on internal control over financial reporting issued by our independent registered public accounting firm to achieve compliance with section 404 within the prescribed period we will be engaged in a process to document and evaluate our internal control over financial reporting which is both costly and challenging in this regard we will need to continue to dedicate internal resources potentially engage outside consultants and adopt a detailed work plan to assess and document the adequacy of internal control over financial reporting continue steps to improve control processes as appropriate validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting despite our efforts there is a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as required by section 404 this could result in an adverse reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of confidence in the reliability of our financial statements 

in july 2010 the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act or the doddfrank act was enacted there are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the doddfrank act that require the sec to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas such as “say on pay” and proxy access recent legislation permits smaller “emerging growth companies” to implement many of these requirements over a longer period and up to five years from our initial public offering we intend to take advantage of this new legislation but cannot guarantee that we will not be required to implement these requirements sooner than budgeted or planned and thereby incur unexpected expenses stockholder activism the current political environment and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 

we are in the early stages of developing our policies and practices regarding preapproval access and any policy we develop and implement may result in a negative perception of our company and have a material adverse impact on our business 

as we advance our pipeline patients and their physicians have sought access to our investigational medicines outside of sponsored clinical trials and prior to regulatory approval while we will continue to review and respond to these early access requests at this stage in our development of a new class of medicines we are not providing access to our investigational medicines outside of the clinical trial setting as our development programs progress further we will continue our dialogue with patients and their families advocacy leaders physicians and others on this and other topics we will post our preapproval access policies in accordance with regulatory guidelines 

as a general matter we do not currently plan on providing forwardlooking guidance regarding the expected timing of milestones in our business we plan to report on the status of our programs including the achievement of milestones and related data on a retrospective basis or as otherwise required by us federal securities laws applicable to us which may lead to speculation about our prospects that could have a material adverse effect on our business 

we believe the nature of our portfolio is not suitable to providing forwardlooking guidance on the expected timing of individual program milestones particularly data readout timing while as a general matter we intend to periodically report on the status of our development programs including articulating anticipated next steps in the form of development plans or potential data readouts we do not currently plan to provide forwardlooking guidance on the timing of those next steps in addition we do not control the timing of disclosure of any such milestones related to any of our programs that are managed by our strategic collaborators any disclosure by our strategic collaborators of data that is perceived as negative whether or not such data is related to other data that we or others 

release may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or overall valuation not providing forwardlooking guidance on the expected timing of program milestones may lead to speculation by investors shareholders analysts and other market participants and in the media as to the progress of our individual development candidates investigational medicines or our programs as a whole which may have a material adverse impact on our stock price or valuation 

if certain communications distributed by a previouslynamed proposed underwriter that did not participate in our initial public offering were held to violate the securities act purchasers of securities in our initial public offering may have the right to seek refunds or damages 

prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement on form s1 for our initial public offering a previouslynamed proposed underwriter and its employees or representatives distributed unauthorized communications regarding our initial public offering this previouslynamed proposed underwriter did not participate as an underwriter in the initial public offering neither we nor any of the underwriters of our initial public offering were involved in any way in the preparation or distribution of the communications by the previouslynamed proposed underwriter and its employees or representatives and neither we nor any of the underwriters of the initial public offering had any knowledge of these communications until after they were distributed upon learning of these communications we directed the previouslynamed proposed underwriter to cease and to retract such communications each of these communications by the previouslynamed proposed underwriter may have constituted a prospectus that did not meet the requirements of the securities act any potential investor who viewed or received these communications should not rely upon them in any manner in making a decision whether to purchase our securities we and the underwriters in our initial public offering disclaim all responsibility for the content of these communications if the communications by the previouslynamed proposed underwriter constitute violations of the securities act the purchasers of our securities in our initial public offering may have the ability to pursue recovery of the consideration paid in connection with their purchase or if they had already sold the securities damages resulting from their purchase 

we are an “emerging growth company” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors 

we are an “emerging growth company” or egc as defined in the jobs act we will remain an egc until the earlier of 

 we may choose to take advantage of some but not all of the available exemptions we have taken advantage of reduced reporting burdens in this annual report on form 10k including the information incorporated herein by reference we cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on certain or all of these exemptions if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile 

in addition the jobs act provides that an egc may take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards this allows an egc to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and therefore while we are an egc we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that are not egcs 

sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock by our existing stockholders in the public market could cause our stock price to fall 

if our existing stockholders sell or indicate an intention to sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market after the lockup and other legal restrictions on resale entered into during our initial public offering lapse the trading price of our common stock could decline only the shares of common stock sold in our initial public offering by us are currently freely tradable without restriction in the public market the lockup agreements will expire 180 days from the date of our initial public offering subject to earlier release of all or a portion of the shares subject to such agreements by the representatives of the underwriters in their sole discretion after the lockup agreements expire up to an additional 3027 million shares of common stock will be eligible for sale in the public market approximately 33 of these additional shares are held by directors executive officers and other affiliates and will be subject to certain limitations of rule 144 under the securities act of 1933 as amended or the securities act 

in addition shares of common stock that are either subject to outstanding options or reserved for future issuance under our existing equity compensation plans will become eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of various vesting schedules the lockup agreements and rule 144 and rule 701 under the securities act if these additional shares of common stock are sold or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market the trading price of our common stock could decline additionally the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our 2018 stock option and incentive plan automatically increased on january 1 2019 and will automatically increase each january 1 thereafter by 4 of the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the immediately preceding december 31 or such lesser number of shares determined by our compensation committee unless our board of directors elects not to increase the number of shares available for future grant each year our stockholders may experience additional dilution 

in addition certain of our employees executive officers and directors have entered or may enter into rule 10b51 trading plans providing for sales of shares of our common stock from time to time under a rule 10b51 trading plan a broker executes trades pursuant to parameters established by the employee director or officer when entering into the plan without further direction from the employee officer or director a rule 10b51 trading plan may be amended or terminated in some circumstances our employees executive officers and directors also may buy or sell additional shares outside of a rule 10b51 trading plan when they are not in possession of material nonpublic information 

the holders of 2360 million shares of our common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of their shares under the securities act subject to the 180day lockup agreements described above registration of these shares under the securities act would result in the shares becoming freely tradable without restriction under the securities act except for shares held by affiliates as defined in rule 144 under the securities act any sales of securities by these stockholders could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock 

raising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing stockholders restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or development candidates or investigational medicines 

we may seek additional capital through a combination of public and private equity offerings debt financings strategic alliances and licensing arrangements to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities your ownership interest will be diluted and the terms may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed payment obligations and could involve restrictive covenants such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise additional funds through collaborations and alliances and licensing arrangements with third parties or through asset sales we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or development candidates or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms unfavorable to us 

if securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock the price of our stock could decline 

the trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our stock price may decline if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly demand for our stock could decrease which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 

our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval 

our executive officers directors five percent stockholders and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 53 of our outstanding common stock therefore these stockholders will have the ability to influence us through their ownership positions for example these stockholders acting together may be able to exert significant influence over matters such as elections of directors amendments of our organizational documents or approval of any merger sale of assets or other major corporate transaction this may prevent or 

discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as one of our stockholders 

we have broad discretion in the use of our cash cash equivalents and investments and may not use them effectively 

our management will have broad discretion in the application of our cash cash equivalents and investments and could spend our funds in ways that do not improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock   the failure by our management to apply these funds effectively could result in financial losses that could have a material adverse impact on our business cause the price of our common stock to decline and delay the development of our investigational medicines   pending their use we may invest our cash cash equivalents and investments in a manner that does not produce income or that loses value 

provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us even if doing so would benefit our stockholders or remove our current management 

our amended and restated certificate of incorporation bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws include provisions that 

 these provisions alone or together could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management 

in addition because we are incorporated in delaware we are governed by the provisions of section 203 of the delaware general corporation law which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15 of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us 

any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 

an active trading market for our common stock may not be sustained 

our shares of common stock began trading on the nasdaq global select market on december 7 2018 given the limited trading history of our common stock there is a risk that an active trading market for our shares will not be sustained which could put downward pressure on the market price of our common stock and thereby affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares 

because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our capital stock in the foreseeable future capital appreciation if any will be your sole source of gain 

we do not currently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our capital stock we currently intend to retain all of our future earnings if any to finance the growth and development of our business in addition the terms of any future debt agreements may 

preclude us from paying dividends as a result capital appreciation if any of our common stock will be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 

our amended and restated bylaws designate the court of chancery of the state of delaware or the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us 

pursuant to our amended and restated bylaws unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum the court of chancery of the state of delaware is the sole and exclusive forum for state law claims for 1 any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf 2 any action asserting a claim of or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors officers or other employees to us or our stockholders 3 any action asserting a claim against us or any of our current or former directors officers employees or stockholders arising pursuant to any provision of the delaware general corporation law or our amended and restated bylaws or 4 any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the united states district court for the district of massachusetts is the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the securities act in addition our amended and restated bylaws provide that any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions provided however that stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder we have chosen the united states district court for the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for such causes of action because our principal executive offices are located in cambridge ma on december 19 2018 the court of chancery of the state of delaware issued a decision declaring that federal forum selection provisions purporting to require claims under the securities act be brought in federal court are ineffective and invalid under delaware law on january 17 2019 the decision was appealed to the delaware supreme court while the delaware supreme court recently dismissed the appeal on jurisdictional grounds we expect that the appeal will be refiled after the court of chancery issues a final judgment unless and until the court of chancery’s decision is reversed by the delaware supreme court or otherwise abrogated we do not intend to enforce our federal forum selection provision designating the district of massachusetts as the exclusive forum for securities act claims in the event that the delaware supreme court affirms the court of chancery’s decision or otherwise determines that federal forum selection provisions are invalid our board of directors intends to amend promptly our amended and restated bylaws to remove our federal forum selection bylaw provision as a result of the court of chancery’s decision or a decision by the delaware supreme court affirming the court of chancery’s decision or if the federal forum selection provision is otherwise found inapplicable to or unenforceable in respect of one or more of the specified actions or proceedings we may incur additional costs which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations we recognize that the federal forum selection clause may impose additional litigation costs on stockholders who assert the provision is not enforceable and may impose more general additional litigation costs in pursuing any such claims particularly if the stockholders do not reside in or near the commonwealth of massachusetts additionally the forum selection clauses in our amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us the court of chancery of the state of delaware and the united states district court for the district of massachusetts may also reach different judgments or results than would other courts including courts where a stockholder considering an action may be located or would otherwise choose to bring the action and such judgments may be more or less favorable to us than our stockholders

 item 7 management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business includes forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties as a result of many factors including those factors set forth in the “risk factors” section of this annual report on form 10k our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forwardlooking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 

overview 

we are a clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering messenger rna mrna therapeutics and vaccines to create a new generation of potentially transformative medicines to improve the lives of patients mrna medicines are designed to direct the body’s cells to produce intracellular membrane or secreted proteins that have a therapeutic or preventive benefit with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases our platform builds on continuous advances in basic and applied mrna science delivery technology and manufacturing providing us the capability to pursue in parallel a robust pipeline of new development candidates we are developing therapeutics and vaccines for infectious diseases immunooncology rare diseases and cardiovascular diseases independently and with our strategic collaborators 

we have designed our strategy and operations to realize the full potential value and impact of mrna over a long time horizon across a broad array of human diseases we built and continue to invest in a platform to advance the technological frontier of mrna medicines we have made forward investments in scalable infrastructure and capabilities to pursue a pipeline of potential medicines that reflect the breadth of the mrna opportunity we have a diverse development pipeline of 20  development candidates 11  of which are in clinical studies our therapeutic and vaccine development programs span infectious diseases oncology cardiovascular diseases and rare genetic diseases we have established strategic alliances with leading biopharmaceutical companies including astrazeneca merck  co or merck and vertex pharmaceuticals or vertex as well as governmentsponsored and private organizations focused on global health initiatives including biomedical advanced research and development authority or barda defense advanced research projects agency or darpa and the bill  melinda gates foundation as we unlock the inherent advantages of mrna we aim to address as many diseases and impact as many patients as our technology talent and capital permit 

the broad potential applications of mrna medicines have led us to raise significant capital and adopt a longterm approach to capital allocation that balances nearterm risks and longterm value creation as of december 31 2018  we have raised over 32 billion  in total funding from a wide range of strategic sources including 24 billion of financing from private equity financings and our initial public offering or ipo and 08 billion  in upfront payments milestone payments and option exercise payments from astrazeneca merck alexion pharma holdings or alexion and vertex as of december 31 2018  we had cash cash equivalents and investments of approximately 17 billion  we use this capital to fund operations and investing activities across research for technology creation drug discovery and clinical development programs infrastructure and capabilities to enable the research engine and early development engine which includes our manufacturing facility in norwood our digital infrastructure creation of our portfolio of intellectual property and administrative support 

on december 11 2018 we completed our ipo whereby we sold 26275993 shares of common stock at a price of 2300 per share the aggregate net proceeds from the ipo were 5630 million  net of underwriting discounts commissions and offering expenses upon the closing of the ipo all outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into 236012913 shares of common stock as of december 31 2018 we had 328798904 shares outstanding shares of our common stock 

since our inception we have incurred significant operating losses our net losses were 3847 million  2559 million  and 2162 million  for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively as of december 31 2018   our accumulated deficit was 10 billion   we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future in addition we anticipate that our expenses will increase significantly in connection with our ongoing activities as we 



 

we do not expect to generate revenue from the sale of potential mrna medicines unless and until we successfully complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of our investigational medicines if we seek to obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize any of our investigational medicines we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses 

as a result we will need substantial additional funding to support our continued operations and pursue our growth strategy until we can generate significant revenue from sales of our medicines if ever we expect to finance our operations through a combination of public or private equity offerings and debt financings government funding arrangements strategic alliances and marketing distribution and licensing arrangements we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements on favorable terms or at all if we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as and when needed we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our programs 

because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with pharmaceutical development we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our medicines we may not become profitable if we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations 

financial operations overview 

revenue 

to date we have not generated any revenue from the sale of potential mrna medicines our revenue has been primarily derived from strategic alliances with strategic collaborators and governmentsponsored and private organizations to discover develop and commercialize potential mrna medicines 

the following is a summary of revenue recognized for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in thousands 



 

 total revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was 1351 million  2058 million  and 1084 million  respectively cash received from strategic alliances was 576 million  431 million and 3242 million for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 respectively the timing of revenue recognition is not directly correlated to the timing of cash receipts total deferred revenue related to our strategic alliances as of december 31 2018  and 2017  was 2744 million  and 3397 million  respectively 

the following table summarizes collaboration revenue for the years ended december 31 2018 2017 and 2016 in thousands 



collaboration revenue for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  was generated primarily from our strategic alliances with astrazeneca merck vertex and alexion our arrangements with alexion were terminated in october 2017 and all rights to mrna researched developed or supplied as part of the programs with alexion reverted to us 

grant revenue is generated primarily from contracts with darpa barda and the bill  melinda gates foundation to develop mrna medicines 

for further information on our revenue recognition policies see the section of this annual report on form 10k titled “critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates—revenue recognition” 

our ability to generate revenue from sales of mrna medicines and become profitable depends upon our ability to successfully develop and commercialize mrna medicines for the foreseeable future we do not expect to generate revenue from product sales to the extent that existing or potential future strategic alliances generate revenue our revenue may vary due to many uncertainties in the development of our mrna medicines under these strategic alliances and other factors we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and we expect these losses to increase as we continue our research and development efforts we expect our programs to mature and advance to later stage clinical development and we expect expenses to increase as we seek regulatory approvals for our investigational medicines and begin to commercialize any approved mrna medicines 

research and development expenses 

the nature of our business and primary focus of our activities generate a significant amount of research and development costs research and development expenses represent costs incurred by us for the following 

 the costs above comprise the following categories 



we use our employee and infrastructure resources for the advancement of our platform and for discovering and developing programs due to the number of ongoing programs and our ability to use resources across several projects indirect or shared operating costs incurred for our research and development programs are not recorded or maintained on a program or modalityspecific basis 

the following table reflects our research and development expenses including direct program specific expenses summarized by modality and indirect or shared operating costs summarized under other research and development expenses during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  in thousands 



 

 

 a  “modality”  refers to a group of programs with common product features and the associated combination of enabling mrna technologies delivery technologies and manufacturing processes the programspecific expenses by modality summarized in the table above include expenses we directly attribute to our programs which consist primarily of external costs such as fees paid to outside consultants central laboratories investigative sites and cros in connection with our preclinical studies and clinical trials and allocated manufacturing costs of mrna supply and consumables costs to acquire and manufacture mrna supply for preclinical studies and clinical trials are recognized and included in unallocated manufacturing expenses when incurred and subsequently allocated to programspecific manufacturing costs after completion of the programspecific production the timing of allocating manufacturing costs to programspecific costs varies depending on the program development and production schedule we do not allocate personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation costs associated with our general platform research technical development and other shared costs on a programspecific basis these costs were therefore excluded from the summary of programspecific expenses summary by modality 

discovery program expenses are costs associated with research activities for our programs in the preclinical discovery stage and primarily consist of external costs for cros and lab services and allocated manufacturing cost of preclinical mrna supply and consumables 

platform research expenses are mainly costs to develop technical advances in mrna science delivery science and manufacturing process design these costs include personnelrelated costs computer equipment facilities preclinical mrna supply and consumables and other administrative costs to support our platform research technology development and unallocated manufacturing expenses are primarily related to nonprogramspecific manufacturing process development and manufacturing costs 

shared discovery and development expenses are research and development costs such as personnelrelated costs and other costs which are not otherwise included in development programs discovery programs platform research technical development and unallocated manufacturing expenses stockbased compensation and other expenses 

we have developed six modalities as of february 15 2019  we had 11  programs in clinical trials and a total of 20 development candidates summarized by modality as follows 

 the largest component of our total operating expenses has historically been our investment in research and development activities including development of our platform mrna technologies and manufacturing technologies we expense research and development costs as incurred and cannot reasonably estimate the nature timing and estimated costs required to complete the development of the development candidates and investigational medicines we are currently developing or may develop in the future there are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the research and development of such development candidates and investigational medicines including but not limited to 

 a change in expectations or outcomes of any of the known or unknown risks and uncertainties may materially impact our expected research and development expenditures continued research and development is central to the ongoing activities of our business investigational medicines in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development primarily due to the increased size and duration of laterstage clinical trials we expect our costs to continue to increase in the future as our investigational medicines progress through the development phases and as we identify and develop additional programs however we do not believe that it is possible at this time to accurately project total programspecific expenses through commercialization there are numerous factors associated with the successful commercialization of any of our investigational medicines including future trial design and various regulatory requirements many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time due to the early stage of development of our investigational medicines additionally future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will impact our clinical development programs and plans 

general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnelrelated costs including stockbased compensation for executives finance legal human resources business development and other administrative and operational functions professional fees accounting and legal services information technology and facilityrelated costs and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining intellectual property or ip these costs relate to the operation of the business unrelated to the research and development function or any individual program 

we anticipate general and administrative expenses will increase as research and development expands these increases will likely relate to additional personnel and increased costs related to finance legal and iprelated matters along with increased expenses related to operating as a publicly traded company such as fees related to audit legal and tax services regulatory compliance programs and investor relations in addition if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our investigational medicines and do not enter into a thirdparty commercialization collaboration we expect to incur significant expenses related to building a sales and marketing team to support medicine sales marketing and distribution activities 

we have a broad ip portfolio covering our development and commercialization of mrna vaccine and therapeutic programs including those related to mrna design formulation and manufacturing platform technologies we regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research and development we also hold trademarks and trademark applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions costs to secure and defend our ip are expensed as incurred and are classified as general and administrative expenses 

general and administrative expenses including iprelated expenses totaled 943 million  647 and 575 for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively iprelated expenses including our internal personnelrelated costs were 119 million 107 million and 109 million for the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  respectively we did not incur litigation expenses related to our ip during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016  

other income expense net 

interest income 

interest income consists of interest generated from our investments in cash and cash equivalents money market funds and highquality fixed income securities 

other income expense 

other income expense net consists of gains losses from the sale of investments in marketable securities interest expense and other income and expense unrelated to our core operations 

critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates 

our management’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements we base our estimates on historical experience known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions on an ongoing basis we evaluate our judgments and estimates in light of changes in circumstances facts and experience the effects of material revisions in estimates if any are reflected in the consolidated financial statements prospectively from the date of change in estimates 

while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form 10k we believe the following accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require the most significant judgments and estimates 

revenue recognition 

we have primarily generated revenue from our strategic alliances our strategic alliances with strategic collaborators typically contain multiple elements including research and other licenses options to obtain development and commercialization rights research and development services obligations to develop and manufacture preclinical and clinical material and options to obtain additional research and development services and preclinical and clinical material such arrangements provide for various types of payments to us including upfront fees funding of research and development services and preclinical and clinical material technical development regulatory and commercial milestone payments licensing fees option exercise fees and royalty and earnout payments on product 

sales such payments are often not commensurate with the timing of revenue recognition and therefore result in deferral of revenue recognition 

we analyze our strategic alliance arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of financial standards accounting board or fasb accounting standards codification or asc topic 808  collaborative arrangements  or asc 808 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards that are dependent on the commercial success of such activities this assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement for strategic alliance arrangements that are deemed to be within the scope of asc 808 we assess which elements of the arrangement are deemed to be within the scope of asc 808 and we recognize our allocation of shared costs incurred with respect to the jointly conducted activities as a component of the related expense in the period incurred 

we also consider the guidance in fasb asc topic 60545  revenue recognition—principal agent considerations  or asc 60545 in determining the appropriate treatment for the transactions between us and our strategic collaborators including the accounting treatment for arrangements in which we are reimbursed for research services performed by a third party generally transactions under our strategic alliance arrangements are recorded on either a gross or net basis based on the nature and contractual terms of the arrangement along with an evaluation of the indicators to identify the principal participant of the arrangement which could require significant judgment 

for those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for under asc 605 revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when all of the following criteria are met 

 further we analyze multiple element arrangements in accordance with fasb asc topic 60525 revenue recognition—multiple element arrangements  or asc 60525 the evaluation involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about individual deliverables and whether such deliverables represent separate units of accounting or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting deliverables are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered items has value to the customer on a standalone basis and ii if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially controlled by us in assessing whether an item has standalone value we consider factors such as the research manufacturing and commercialization capabilities of the strategic collaborator and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace in addition we consider whether the strategic collaborator can use the other deliverables for their intended purpose without the receipt of the remaining elements whether the value of the deliverable is dependent on the undelivered items and whether there are other vendors that can provide the undelivered elements 

arrangement consideration that is fixed or determinable is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on the relative selling price method and the applicable revenue recognition criteria in asc 60525 are applied to determine the appropriate period and pattern of recognition we determine the selling price of a unit of accounting following the hierarchy of evidence prescribed by asc 60525 accordingly we determine the estimated selling price for units of accounting within each arrangement using vendorspecific objective evidence or vsoe of selling price if available thirdparty evidence or tpe of selling price if vsoe is not available or best estimate of selling price or besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available we typically use besp to estimate the selling price because we generally do not have vsoe nor tpe of selling price for our units of accounting determining the besp for a unit of accounting requires significant judgment in developing the besp for a unit of accounting we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entityspecific factors including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the strategic collaborator and estimated costs we validate the besp for units of accounting by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the besp will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple units of accounting 

we recognize arrangement consideration allocated to each unit of accounting when all of the revenue recognition criteria under asc 60525 are satisfied for that particular unit of accounting we will recognize revenue associated with licenses options or the discount related to an option upon i delivery of the license or ii the earlier of exercise or expiration of the option if the underlying license has standalone value from the other deliverables to be provided after delivering that license if the license does not have standalone value the amounts allocated to the license will be combined with the related undelivered items as a single unit of accounting and recognized over the estimated period of performance or delivery of the combined unit of accounting 

revenue related to the units of accounting that contain several deliverables is recognized as the last to be delivered element is provided which is generally over the period that research services are provided if there is no discernible pattern of performance or objectively measurable performance measures do not exist we recognize revenue on a straightline basis over the expected period of performance conversely if the pattern of performance can be determined and objectively measurable performance measures exist then we recognize revenue under the arrangement using the proportional performance method revenue recognized is limited to the lesser of the cumulative amount of payments received or the cumulative revenue earned determined using the straightline method or proportional performance as applicable as of the period end date 

our thirdparty arrangements may include options for our strategic collaborators to acquire development and commercialization rights to our mrna programs or with respect to specific targets or options to receive research and development services or preclinical or clinical materials from us options are considered substantive if at the inception of the arrangement we are at risk as to whether the strategic collaborator will choose to exercise the option the evaluation of whether an option is substantive requires significant judgment in determining if the option is substantive we consider the overall objective of the arrangement the benefit the third party might obtain from the arrangement without exercising the option the likelihood that the option will be exercised or if the third party is required or compelled through significant incentive to exercise the option when an option is considered substantive we do not consider the option or item underlying the option to be a deliverable at inception of the arrangement and the associated option fee is not included in the allocable arrangement consideration assuming the option is not priced at a significant and incremental discount conversely if we determine that an option is not substantive we will consider the item underlying the option to be a deliverable at the inception of the arrangement and the associated option exercise fee is included in the allocable arrangement consideration in addition if the price of the option includes a significant and incremental discount then the option is not considered substantive 

our arrangements may include additional payments that are subject to achievement of milestone events including specific technical development regulatory and commercial milestones at the inception of an arrangement that includes milestone payments we evaluate whether each milestone is substantive and at risk to both parties on the basis of the contingent nature of the milestone this evaluation includes an assessment of whether i the consideration is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered items as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone ii the consideration relates solely to past performance and iii the consideration is reasonably relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms within the arrangement we evaluate factors such as scientific clinical regulatory commercial and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the respective milestones and the level of effort and investment required to achieve the respective milestones in making this assessment there is considerable judgment involved in determining whether a milestone satisfies all of the criteria required to conclude that a milestone is substantive in accordance with fasb asc topic 60528  revenue recognition—milestone method  or asc 60528 a technical development or regulatory milestone that is considered substantive will be recognized as revenue in its entirety upon successful accomplishment of the milestone amounts received from milestones that are not considered substantive would be considered additional arrangement consideration and allocated to the identified units of accounting revenue from commercial milestone payments will be accounted for as royalties and recorded as revenue upon achievement of the milestone assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

we will recognize royalty revenue in the period of sale of the related medicines based on the underlying contract terms provided that the reported sales are reliably measurable we have no remaining undelivered elements and assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 

our contracts with darpa barda and the bill  melinda gates foundation provide for reimbursed costs which may include overhead and general and administrative costs as well as a related profit margin we recognize revenue from these contracts as we perform services under the arrangements so long as an agreement has been executed and the fees for the services are fixed or determinable legally billable and reasonably assured of collection recognized amounts reflect our performance under the agreements we do not recognize revenue under these agreements for amounts related to contract periods where funding is not yet committed as fees above committed funding thresholds would not be considered fixed or determinable or reasonably assured of collection revenues and related expenses are presented gross in the consolidated statements of operations as we have determined we are the primary obligor under the arrangements relative to the research and development services we perform as lead technical expert 

research and development costs 

as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses a significant portion of which are clinical study expenses conducted by thirdparty service providers this process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to 



 we base our expenses related to clinical trials on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with cros that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows there may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical trial milestones in accruing service fees we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly 

we make estimates of our research and development accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time we recognize costs for certain development activities based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites such as number of sites activated number of patient enrollments and visits and patient duration we determine accrual estimates through financial models that take into account discussions with applicable personnel and service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials we periodically confirm the accuracy of these estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary upon settlement these costs may differ materially from the amounts accrued in our consolidated financial statements our historical accrual estimates have not been materially different from our actual costs however due to the nature of estimates we cannot provide assurance that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of our research activities and clinical trials 

stockbased compensation 

we issue stockbased awards to employees and nonemployees generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units historically we also granted unit options and incentive units to our employees and nonemployees which were exchanged into options and restricted stock awards in connection with the series of transactions pursuant to which moderna llc became a whollyowned subsidiary of moderna therapeutics inc or the 2016 reorganization please refer to note 1 to our consolidated financial statements we measure and recognize compensation expense for our stockbased awards granted to our employees and nonemployee directors based on the estimated grant date fair value in accordance with fasb asc topic 718  compensation—stock compensation  or asc 718 we account for stockbased awards to nonemployees in accordance with fasb asc topic 50550  equitybased payments to nonemployees  which requires the fair value of the unvested portion of the equity awards granted to nonemployees to be remeasured as of each reporting date 

our stockbased awards are subject to either service or performancebased vesting conditions we recognize compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployee directors with servicebased vesting on a straightline basis based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period compensation expense related to awards to employees and nonemployee directors with performancebased vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using an accelerated attribution method to the extent the achievement of the performance condition is probable compensation expense related to awards to nonemployees with servicebased vesting conditions is recognized on the thencurrent fair value at each reporting date prior to the measurement date over the requisite service period which is generally the vesting period compensation expense related to awards to nonemployees with performancebased vesting conditions is recognized based on the thencurrent grant date fair value at each reporting date prior to the measurement date over the requisite service period using an accelerated attribution method to the extent the achievement of the performance condition is probable as of january 1 2017 we made an accounting policy election to recognize forfeitures of stockbased awards as they occur upon adoption of fasb asu no 201609  compensation—stock compensation  

we classify stockbased compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient’s salary and related costs are classified or in which the award recipient’s service payments are classified in future periods we expect stockbased compensation expense to increase due in part to our existing unrecognized stockbased compensation expense and as we grant additional stockbased awards to continue to attract and retain our employees 

we determine the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units based on the fair value of our common stock we estimate the fair value of our stock options and prior to the 2016 reorganization unit options and incentive units using the blackscholes option pricing model which requires inputs of subjective assumptions including i the expected volatility of our stock or prior to the 2016 reorganization units ii the expected term of the award iii the riskfree interest rate iv expected dividends and v the fair value of common stock or prior to the 2016 reorganization units due to the lack of company specific historical and implied volatility data we based our estimate of expected volatility on the estimate and expected volatilities of a guideline group of publicly traded companies for these analyses we select companies with comparable characteristics to ours including enterprise value risk profiles and with historical share price information sufficient to meet the expected life of the stockbased awards we compute the historical volatility data using the daily closing prices for the selected companies’ shares during the equivalent period of the calculated 

expected term of our stockbased awards we will continue to apply this process until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price becomes available we estimate the expected term of our stock options granted to employees and nonemployee directors using the simplified method whereby the expected term equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option we utilize this method as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term for stock options granted to nonemployees we utilize the contractual term of the option as the basis for the expected term assumption for the determination of the riskfree interest rates we utilize the us treasury yield curve for instruments in effect at the time of measurement with a term commensurate with the expected term assumption the expected dividend yield is assumed to be zero as we have never paid dividends and do not have current plans to pay any dividends on our common stock historically for periods prior to our ipo the fair value of our equity instruments underlying our stockbased awards were determined on each grant date by our board of directors based on valuation estimates from management considering our most recently available independent thirdparty valuation of our equity instruments our board of directors also assessed and considered with input from management additional objective and subjective factors that we believed were relevant and which may have changed from the date of the most recent valuation through the grant date 

income taxes 

we account for income taxes based on an asset and liability approach we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns we determine our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities which are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 

realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income the amount and timing of which are uncertain valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of december 31 2018 we continued to maintain a full valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets based on management’s evaluation of all available evidence 

we may become subject to income tax audits and adjustments by local tax authorities the nature of uncertain tax positions is subject to significant judgment by management and subject to change which may be substantial we develop our assessment of uncertain tax positions and the associated cumulative probabilities using internal expertise and assistance from thirdparty experts as additional information becomes available estimates are revised and refined differences between estimates and final settlement may occur resulting in additional tax expense 

we record reserves for potential tax payments to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions these reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present related to the tax benefit potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense to date no amount has been recorded for uncertain tax positions 

on december 22 2017 the tax cuts and jobs act the tcja was enacted the tcja among other things contains significant changes to corporate taxation including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35 to a flat rate of 21 limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30 of adjusted earnings except for certain small businesses limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80 of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated elimination of us tax on foreign earnings subject to certain important exceptions immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits 

due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity involved in applying the provisions of the tcja we made reasonable estimates and recognized the effects of the tcja in our consolidated financial statements as of december 31 2017 the tcja resulted in a 641 million reduction to deferred tax assets and a corresponding reduction in our valuation allowance as we collected and prepared necessary data and interpreted the additional guidance of the tcja we completed our analysis to determine the effects of the tcja as of december 31 2018 no material adjustments were made in 2018 

recently issued accounting pronouncements

cash flow 

the following table summarizes the primary sources and uses of cash for each period presented in thousands 



operating activities 

we derive cash flows from operations primarily from cash collected from certain strategic alliances our cash flows from operating activities are significantly influenced by our use of cash for operating expenses and working capital to support the business we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operating activities as we have invested early in our mrna technologies digital infrastructure manufacturing technology and infrastructure

operation and funding requirements 

since our inception we have incurred significant losses and negative cash flows from operations due to our significant research and development expenses we have an accumulated deficit of 10066 million  and 6219 million  as of december 31 2018  and 2017  respectively we expect to continue to incur significant losses in the foreseeable future and expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities particularly as we continue research and development of our development candidates and clinical activities for our investigational medicines in addition we expect to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company our expenses will also increase if and as we 



 we are subject to all the risks related to the development and commercialization of novel medicines and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forwardlooking statement and involves risks and uncertainties and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect we believe that our cash cash equivalents and investments as of december 31 2018  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our projected operations through at least the next 12 months 

our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to 

 until we can generate a sufficient amount of revenue from our programs we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings and potential future strategic alliances from which we receive upfront fees milestone payments and other forms of consideration additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms if at all if we are unable to raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us we may have to significantly delay scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our investigational medicines or slow down or cease work on one or more of our programs if we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities it could result in dilution to our existing stockholders or increased fixed payment obligations and any such securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock if we incur indebtedness we could become subject to covenants that would restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt limitations on our ability to acquire sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business if we raise funds through strategic alliances or marketing distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies future revenue streams research programs or investigational medicines or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us any of these events could significantly harm our business financial condition and prospects 

off balance sheet arrangements 

as of december 31 2018  we did not have any offbalance sheet arrangements as defined in item 303a4ii of regulation sk 

contractual obligations and commitments 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december 31 2018  and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands 



 

 under our strategic collaboration agreements we are committed to perform certain research development and manufacturing activities please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements as part of our personalized mrna cancer vaccines or pcv collaboration and license agreement with merck we are committed to perform certain research development and manufacturing activities related to pcv products through an initial phase 2 clinical trial up to a budgeted amount of 2000 million as of december 31 2018 in april 2018 we amended the pcv agreement with merck and the budgeted commitment increased to 2430 million please refer to note 3 to the consolidated financial statements the expenses we expect to incur as part of our commitments under the pcv and other collaboration agreements were not included in the above table as we are not able to determine the timing and amounts of such expenses 

we have agreements with certain vendors for various services including services related to clinical operations and support which we are not contractually able to terminate for convenience certain agreements provide for termination rights subject to termination fees or wind down costs under such agreements we are contractually obligated to make certain payments to vendors mainly to reimburse them for their unrecoverable outlays incurred prior to cancellation the exact amounts of such obligations are dependent on the timing of termination and the exact terms of the relevant agreement and cannot be reasonably estimated at december 31 2018  we had cancelable open purchase orders of 642 million  in total under such agreements for our clinical operations and support these amounts represent only our estimate of those items for which we had a contractual commitment to pay at december 31 2018  assuming we would not cancel these agreements the actual amounts we pay in the future to the vendors under such agreements may differ from the cancelable open purchase order amounts of 642 million  

in addition to the above obligations we enter into a variety of agreements and financial commitments in the normal course of business the terms generally allow us the option to cancel reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments 

under these agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement 

in february 2019 we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space located in norwood ma or the new norwood lease the rent payment obligation for the new norwood lease will commence fourteen months after the date the premises are delivered to us and expire in 2031 contemporaneously we entered into a sublease agreement to sublease a portion of the new norwood lease space to a third party 

the following table summarizes our contractual obligations in connection the new norwood lease and the effects that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods from december 31 2018 in thousands 

jobs act and emerging growth company status 

in april 2012 the jobs act was enacted as an emerging growth company or egc under the jobs act we may delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements under the jobs act for egcs include an exemption from the requirement to provide an auditor’s report on internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to section 404b of the sarbanesoxley act of 2002 an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the public company accounting oversight board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation and less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements additionally the jobs act provides that an egc can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards this allows an egc to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we have elected to avail ourselves of this exemption and therefore while we are an egc we will not be subject to new or revised accounting standards at the same time that they become applicable to other public companies that are not egcs 

we will remain classified as an egc until the earlier of i the last day of our first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of 107 billion or more ii december 31 2023 being the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our ipo iii the date on which we have issued more than 10 billion of nonconvertible debt instruments during the previous three fiscal years or iv the date on which we are deemed a “large accelerated filer” under the rules of the sec  




 item 7a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 

our primary exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates as of december 31 2018  and 2017  we had cash cash equivalents restricted cash and investments in marketable securities of 17 billion  and 09 billion  respectively our investment portfolio is comprised of money market funds and marketable debt securities including us treasury securities debt securities of us government agencies and corporate entities and commercial paper our primary investment objectives are the preservation of capital and the maintenance of liquidity and our investment policy defines allowable investments based on quality of the institutions and financial instruments designed to minimize risk exposure our exposure to interest rate sensitivity is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates our available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 

we generally hold investments in marketable debt securities to maturity to limit our exposure to interest rate risk due to the shortterm maturities and low risk profiles of our investments we do not anticipate a significant exposure to interest rate risk if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by 100 basis points or one percentage point from levels at december 31 2018  and 2017 the net fair value of our interest sensitive marketable securities would not experience a material change in fair market value 

we currently do not have significant exposure to foreign currencies as we hold no foreign exchange contracts option contracts or other foreign hedging arrangements further our operations and revenue generating activities are denominated in us dollars our operations may be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the future 

inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business financial condition or results of operations during the years ended december 31 2018  2017  and 2016
